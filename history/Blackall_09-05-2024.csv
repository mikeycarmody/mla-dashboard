Total Yarding: 1500 (-3500)
Commentary
"1,500 head of cattle were yarded for the annual Blackall show sale for 2024. The yarding included some very good quality pens of local heavy cows alongside some good quality runs of yearling steers. The return of one major export processor saw prices improve by 10 to 20c on prime cattle and an increase in quality saw averages on yearlings also strengthen. 

Improved competition from local and northern restockers saw steers 280 to 330kg sell to 398.2c to average 365c, up by 10c, with medium weights selling to 386.2c to average 360c/kg.
Heavy feeder steers sold to 314.2c to average 304c with restockers paying up to 320c/kg.

Light weight restocker heifers sold to 286.2c and medium weight feeder heifers sold to 270.2c to average 248c/kg.

Heavy heifers to the processor sold to 274.2c, medium cows under 520kg lifted 19c selling to 222.2c to average 211c and good heavy cows improved by 15c to a top of 232.2c averaging 225c/kg.
