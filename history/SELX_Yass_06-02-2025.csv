Commentary
"Numbers were steady and the quality improved. There were good lines of feeder steers and heifers and a few more yearling that suited the trade buyers. Grown steers were well represented by lighter 2 tooth steers and the prime heavy weights were back in numbers. Heavy prime heifers also had a reduction in numbers and only 95 cows were penned. The market sold to mixed trends but most were firm to dearer.

Weaner steers were dearer with most ranging between 355c and 400c and heifers 260c to 300c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers were firm selling from 290c to 337c but heavy weights were back 15c on average 305c to 335c/kg. The medium weight feeder heifers were 8c stronger selling between 240c and 301c and the heavy weights were slightly softer reaching 302c and averaged 289c/kg. The best of the trade steers reached 330c/kg.

Grown steers to feed fell 15c and ranged from 291c to 310c and the prime grown steers and bullocks were dearer receiving 316c to 348c/kg. Heavy grown heifers were fully firm reaching 300c/kg. Heavy cows were firm to slightly dearer with the heavy 3 score cows lifting and ranged from 254c to 280c and the 2 score medium weights sold from 210c to 250c/kg."
