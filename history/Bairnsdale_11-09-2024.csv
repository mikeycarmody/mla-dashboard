Commentary
"There were 210 export and 15 young cattle penned representing an increase of 120 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a dearer market in places. Quality was very mixed with prime cattle in short supply. There were no trade lots with the sprinkling of young cattle selling to restockers. The grown run was mostly manufacturing steers which lifted 10c/kg. Lightly conditioned dairy cows sold firm while heavy beef cows with finish lifted 10c/kg. Heavy bulls gained 9c/kg. 

Yearling steers, heifers and bulls to restockers sold from 286c to 362c/kg. Manufacturing steers made between 255c and 360c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold between 232c and 305c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly from 272c to 354c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 295c to 340c/kg.
