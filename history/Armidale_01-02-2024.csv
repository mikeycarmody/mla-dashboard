Commentary
"There was a sharp increase in numbers as producers took advantage of the high demand for cattle of all descriptions and offloaded. This being the largest offering for several years. There was a large gallery of buyers in attendance including several not seen for sometime. The quality of the offering was generally good while condition varied to suit all buyers from restockers through to export processors.

Buoyed by a good season and the current state of the market restockers were active throughout the young cattle. Weaners returning to the paddock sold to a significantly dearer trend with both the steers and the heifer portions keenly sought. Light and medium weight yearling steers saw some of the greatest improvement with both restockers and feedlots competing fiercely. Strong gains were also experienced in the heavy weight feeders with the majority destined for Northern feedlots. Yearlings heifers in all weight classes posted strong gains however the increases were not as great as those of the steers.

With higher weights in demand the grown steers with 2 or more teeth were keenly sought to produce some of the larger price improvements. Well finished heavy weight steers to the processors sold to dearer trends with strong gains in place. Grown heifers also sold to much dearer trends with some good quality lines suitable to the feedlots and some very well finished lots purchased by processors.the cow market saw some variation with a few to restockers selling to a slightly cheaper trend however quality was a factor. The well finished cows were slightly dearer while those in the 5 score category were substantially dearer. A large offering of bulls were keenly sought by processors to show a firm to dearer trend."
