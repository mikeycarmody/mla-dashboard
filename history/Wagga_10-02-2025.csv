Commentary
"There was a decline in overall numbers but a noticeable improvement in quality. The sale featured an impressive lineup of grain-fed yearlings, which contributed to the overall positive prices across trade weights 400 to 500kg. A larger contingent of buyers attended the sale, including restockers from Dubbo and Forbes, along with restocking orders from further north. The presence of a significant number of feedlot buyers, alongside several key export processors, helped the market gain traction, resulting in price increases across most classes.
 
One of the standout performers this week were the vealers, which commanded prices ranging from 349c to 394c/kg. Trade steers and heifers were in reasonable supply, selling for between 292c and 366c/kg. The demand for feeder steers was particularly strong, with medium weights jumping 9c to fetch between 305c and 370c/kg. Lighter feeder steers saw an even more substantial increase, climbing 23c to reach a top price of 380c/kg. Steers destined for the paddock were a hot commodity, gaining 40c to 73c and achieving a top price of 420c/kg. The big lift in demand highlights the growing interest in restocking by our northern counterparts.
 
On the export front, competition was strong for heavy bullocks, which sold between 315c and 378c/kg. Heavy steers saw fluctuating demand, driven by age and breed, with prices ranging from 292c to 328c/kg. As the sale progressed, heavy cow prices continued to rise, with heavy cows making between 272c and 309c/kg. Leaner cows with some fat cover were priced between 240c and 284c/kg. Restockers entered the cow market paying from 228c to 271c/kg."
