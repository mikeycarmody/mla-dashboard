Commentary
"The numbers almost doubled as access to yards dries out. The quality of the offering was very mixed with some good lines of quality cattle to suit restockers and feeders along with plainer lots. The condition of the offering showed a great variation with some very well finished grown cattle to suit processors as well as a run of plain quality light conditioned manufacturing steers. The usual processors were in attendance as were the usual restocker and feedlot orders.

Light weight steers were keenly sought by restockers heading into what looks to be an outstanding season. Both the weaners and the yearlings sold to dearer trends. The few medium weights also attracted strong competition from restockers and feedlotters to sell to a dearer trend also. Heavy weight feeder steers sold to a cheaper trend with some breed related price change also. Light and medium weight yearling heifers sold to dearer trends with some well bred heifers in forward condition presented.

The manufacturing steers sold strongly in comparison to the well finished good quality lines. There is no like for like comparison available from the last sale. Feeder steers with 2 or more teeth attracted strong demand despite a large number in the light weight class. Well finished, good quality heavy grown steers saw processor competition very strong with a much dearer market trend the result. That strong processor demand carried into the grown heifers and cows with market trends also dearer. The bull market was firm to slightly dearer taking quality into account."
