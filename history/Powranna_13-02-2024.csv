Commentary
"There was a much larger yarding of 200 cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with a better line-up of yearlings. The market lost the gains of last week with yearling steers making 230c to 248c and heifers 228c to 256c while the seconds made 214c to 224c/kg.
Most grown steers and bullocks made 230c to 270c while heavy export heifers made 228c to 260c/kg.

There were 70 cows with the best heavy pens made 210c to 220c and the seconds 150c to 200c/kg liveweight.
