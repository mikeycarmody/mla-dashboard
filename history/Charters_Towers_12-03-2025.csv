Commentary
"The supply of cattle more than halved for a yarding of 1542 head. Quality was mixed, comprising of a reduced number of heavy prime cattle, however some very good quality store steers and heifers were penned. One major processor was absent from the buyer panel, while those in attendance including opportunity feeders and backgrounders mostly operated at reduced rates. Cattle were drawn from Burketown, Mt Isa, Julia Ck, Einasleigh, local and coastal areas.

Most categories eased on last sale, however odd pens sold at improved values. Yearling steers improved 16c to 23c, yearling heifers to feed were firm to 11c easier, Grown steers and heifers averaged 10c to 22c lower, medium weight cows to processors were mostly firm.

Young steers returning to the paddock averaged 263c selling to 282c, with similar heifers averaging 256c/kg. Yearling steers to backgrounders reached 270c to average 262c, with steers above 280kg to feed selling to 278c to average 254c to 278c/kg. A large line of very good quality yearling heifers above 330kg to feed sold for 254c/kg.
A small offering of grown steers to feed made from 266c to 268c/kg. Heavy steers to the trade sold for 272c/kg. Grown heifers to the trade reached 262c, a good sample averaging 244c to 250c/kg.

A limited supply of heavy bullocks sold to 284c, most from 264c to 272c/kg. Medium weight 3 score cows to processors sold to 246c, averaging 236c/kg. Heavy bulls to processors made to 248c, most from 220c to 240c/kg.

A small number of cows and calves sold from $725 to $1,025 per unit.
