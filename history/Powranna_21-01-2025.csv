Commentary
"There was a larger yarding of 141 trade and export cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with over half being cows and very few good quality butcher cattle included.

The trade cattle market was cheaper with yearling steers making 298c to 332c and heifers 278c to 348c. The best grown steers made 288c to 322c while crossbreds made 238c to 272c.

There were 88 cows yarded and all met strong competition with heavy beef pens making 260c to 292c, leaner 200c to 256c and very lean 150c to 210c. The few heavy bulls made 220c to 224c/kg live.
