Commentary
"Following three weeks of declining numbers the supply of stock at Oakey increased by 500 head to 1200. Buyer representation across all classes was good and included southern export processors and all were operating in a firm to dearer market.

Light weight yearling steers and heifers returning to the paddock averaged  12c to 14c/kg better. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed experienced very little change in price. A lift in the standard of the medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to feed improved average prices by 4c to 12c/kg. A good lineup of cows were firm to 5c to 6c/kg dearer. Heavy weight bulls also sold to a market 5c/kg better.

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock made to a top of 446c with a good sample averaging 403c/kg. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market averaged from 376c to 382c with sales to 392c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed made to a top of 398c with a large number averaging 374c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers returning to the paddock made to an isolated 350c to average 295c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed made to 354c to average 330c, and heavy weights averaged 325c and made to 352c/kg.

Heavy grown steers and bullocks to export processors made to 355c with most in the mid-340c/kg range. Medium weight 2 score cows averaged 257c with sales to 276c/kg. Heavy weight 3 score cows averaged 286c and the best of the heavy weight cows made to 321c a fair sample at 312c/kg. Heavy weight bulls made to 323c/kg.
