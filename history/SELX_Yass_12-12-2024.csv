Commentary
"There was a slight increase in numbers, for a total yarding of 996 fair, to good quality cattle. There was a limited supply of prime yearlings to suit the trade, with most young cattle returning to the paddock or feedlot. There were a few good pens of heavy grown cattle and there were 180 cows. All the usual buyers, with the addition of extra restocker orders, resulted in a dearer market.

Prime yearlings lifted 6c, selling from 310c to 350c/kg. Feeder steers were up to 10c dearer, making from 304c to 355c, and heifers to feed averaged 299c/kg. Young cattle to the restockers were considerably dearer, with the steers ranging from 325c to 432c and the heifers made from 205c to 360c/kg..

Heavy grown steers were 5c better, topping at 350c and grown heifers were also 5c dearer, reaching 341c/kg. There was still strong demand for the cows, with 2 and 3 scores selling from 160c to 286c and the best heavy prime cows made 294c/kg. Heavy bulls to process were significantly dearer, ranging from 268c to 304c/kg.
