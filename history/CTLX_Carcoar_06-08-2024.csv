Commentary
"The number of cattle penned at CTLX Carcoar experienced a small lift of 170 head to 1,854.  The regular panel of buyers was present and active in a firm to dearer market. Good quality lines of feeder steers and cows dominated the yarding with only a handful reflecting the cold conditions.

Medium weight yearling steers to feed made to 437c to average 402c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed were well supplied and sold to 417c with the largest numbers from 387c to 392c/kg. A small sample to the local trade market made to 386c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers made to 324c and poor quality lines 180c/kg. Heavy yearling heifers to feed averaged 337c and made to 361c and local trade lines made to 374c/kg.

Heavy grown steers and bullocks averaged from 364c to 371 with sales to 378c/kg. Heavy weight grown heifers out sold the steers and made to 384c and averaged 350c/kg.

Medium weight 2 score cows averaged 264c and sold to 270c/kg. Heavy weight 3 scores averaged 295c with sales to 308c/kg. The best of the good heavy cows made to 330c to average 320c/kg. Heavy weight bulls made to 276c/kg.
