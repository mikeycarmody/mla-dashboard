Commentary
"The continuing dry conditions combined with the solid markets found extra numbers this week with a yarding of a little over 6000. It was a pretty good quality yarding with good numbers of prime cattle in all sections along with the usual runs of far western cattle. There were particularly large numbers of grown heifers and heifer yearlings yarded.
 
Young cattle to the trade were around firm with prime vealers and yearlings selling from 296c to 380c/kg. Feeder steers were up to 8c dearer the feeder heifers though were up to 10c cheaper. Feeder steers sold from 320c to 396c while the feeder heifers sold from 255c to 337c/kg. Young cattle to the restockers were around firm with the young steers selling to 438c and the young restocker heifers sold to 335c/kg.
 
Grown steers were 4c dearer while the grown heifers were firm to 3c/kg cheaper. Prime grown steers sold from 310c to 390c while the prime grown heifers sold from 310c to 360c/kg. Cows were 10c to 20c cheaper with the 2 and 3 scores selling from 255c to 300c while the prime heavy weight cows sold from 280c to 330c to average 316c/kg. There were a couple of fresh restocker orders for the plainer cows yarded with the restockers paying from 258c to 282c/kg. Heavy bulls were dearer selling to 342c/kg.
