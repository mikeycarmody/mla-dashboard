Total Yarding: 162 (+12)
Commentary
"There was a similar total of 162 cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with quality poor as the very dry conditions are showing their effects.
There were very few good quality trade cattle and steers made 190c to 208c and heifers 190c to 220c/kg. There were not enough grown steers or heifers to quote.

There was a larger yarding of 80 cows with the best heavy cows making 150c to 174c while restockers bought most of the leaner cows. The best of these made 120c to 148c and very lean 60c to 122c/kg liveweight.
