Commentary
"There was a large lift in supply to 2,071 cattle at Forbes an increase of 1,091 head from the previous sale. The increase in numbers attracted additional export buyers into the market. The overall quality was good with a number of consignments of crop and access to grain. Prices were firm to dearer across most classes.

Medium weight yearling steers to feed averaged 379c and made to 418c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed sold to 415c on a number of occasions with the largest numbers from 392c to 405c/kg. Heavy weight yearling heifers to feed made to 370c with most sales from 294c to 342c/kg. Heavy weight yearling heifers to the local trade market averaged 352 with the very occasional sale to 400c/kg.

Heavy grown steers to export processors made to 372 and the bullock portion made to 368c/kg. However some excellent quality heavy export heifers made to 369c to average 366c/kg. A handful of 6 and 8 tooth bullocks made to 340c to average 333c/kg. 

Medium weight 2 score cows averaged 242c and made to 260c/kg. Heavy weight 3 score cows were noticeably dearer to averaged 288c and the best of the good heavy cows made to 315c to average 306c/kg. Heavy weight bulls made to 283c/kg.
