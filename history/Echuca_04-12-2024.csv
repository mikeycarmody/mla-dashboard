Commentary
"Dearer market following widespread rain and a reduction in supply. Agents yarded 1560 cattle, down from the 1900 head plus which were regularly offered in recent weeks. Price improvements of 10c to 25c/kg were broadly seen across the market, with some higher spikes in excess of 50c recorded at times for young and lighter store cattle as they rebounded from the discounted rates of recent sales. There was, however, still an element of selective bidding over trade cattle based on quality with one key trade order absent. Some of the heavier grown cattle also had mixed results. But overall results were still dearer.

Prices reached a top of 380c/kg for young Limousin steers off feed that showed a lot of weight for age and quality at 585kg. Most of the lead pens of prime trade cattle from 345c to 372c/kg, with the next run with not quite as much polish and yield from 320c to 340c/kg. Recording some of the best price gains were store and feeder steers, the main run of nicely bred yearlings in the 330-400kg range selling from
297c to 355.6c/kg to average 344c/kg for a 26c gain on a fortnight ago. Some lighter Angus store steers sold to 372c/kg back to the paddock. The young cattle that tended to sell under 300c/kg today tended to be plainer shaped or crossbred types at 240c to 290c/kg. Some of the plainer grass heifers were also under 300c/kg.

In the grown steer section the best beef types in the 500-600kg range sold from 311c to 350c for a rise of 15c on a fortnight ago. Export steers over 600kg 325c to 350c/kg for the best quality, older or plainer shapes 284c to 325c/kg. Not many Friesian steers but the few with good finish sold dearer at 275c to 310c/kg. Heavy grown heifers generally 300c to 330c/kg, again with the plainer or crossbred types 260c to 290c/kg.

Cow prices gained 15c to 28c/kg to recover the losses of last month.. Heavy beef cows in fat score 4 condition 291c to 300c/kg, and the score 3s 272c to 291c/kg lwt. Leaner and light cows, including some dairyâ€™s, were significantly dearer at 22c to 262c/kg.

NOTE: This was the final Echuca sale for 2024.
Next year the Echuca prime cattle market will be held weekly instead of fortnightly, with the weekly sales scheduled to start on Wednesday January 15.
