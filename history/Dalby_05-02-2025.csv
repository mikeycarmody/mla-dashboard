Commentary
"The supply of cattle at Dalby experienced a large lift of 1,508 to make a total of 5,003 head. Export buyer attendance was good and all were operating in a generally dearer market. The regular feed and trade buyers plus restockers were also present and active in the market. 

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock sold to a market 12c to 15c/kg better. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed experienced very little change in price. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers were in demand and averaged over 30c/kg dearer. Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to feed lifted in price by 5c to 6c/kg. Heavy grown steers and bullocks were noticeably dearer. All classes of cows improved in price with gains of 7c to 13c and over 20c/kg in places. 

Yearling steers under 200kg made to 486c to average 443c/kg. A large sample of light weight yearling steers to restockers made to 470c to average from 423c to 434c/kg. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market averaged from 374c to 406c with sales to 410c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed averaged 370c and made to 387c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers returning to the paddock made to 370c with most sales 309c to 326c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed averaged from 311c to 333c with sales to 354c/kg. Heavy weight yearling heifers to feed made to 342c to average 318c/kg.

Heavy grown steers and bullocks averaged 352c with the grown steers reaching 364c and the bullock portion 362c/kg. Medium weight plain condition cows to restockers averaged 288c/kg. Medium weight 2 scores to export processors averaged 262c and made to 270c/kg. Heavy weight 3 score cows averaged 275c and the best of the heavy weights made to 318c to average 292c/kg. Heavy weight bulls also improved in price and made to 314c/kg.
