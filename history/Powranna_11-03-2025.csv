Commentary
"There was a much larger yarding of 273 cattle at Powranna on Tuesday as the current dry and hot weather conditions continue.
The trade cattle market was dominated by restockers who pushed prices 20c to 25c higher with yearling steers making 288c to 316c and heifers 280c to 320c.
Grown steers were mixed in quality and made 240c to 322c while heifers made 258c to 270c.
There was a larger number of approximately 140 cows and this market was cheaper right throughout with heavy cows making 228c to 250c, leaner 200c to 220c and very lean 92c to 190c.
Heavy bulls made 180c to 228c/kg liveweight.
