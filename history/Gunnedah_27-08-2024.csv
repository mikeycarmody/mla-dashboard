Commentary
"There was an increase in supply as the yards become more accessible following the wet weather. There were large numbers of young cattle, not many exports while cows were in fair supply. The quality and condition of the offering was fair to good however showed a greater variation than the previous sale. Most of the regular orders were in place however a couple of processors were absent.

Warm weather, green feed and a strong market saw restockers push prices for light and medium weight yearling steers upwards with the overall trend dearer while there were some very strong breed specific sales. Quality accounted for some price change. The heavy feeder steers experienced a mostly firm market trend, there were however odd cheaper sales in the mixed breed pens. There was a large price gap between the light weight yearling heifers and their steer counterparts with the lighter end of the weight range selling to a cheaper trend while the heavier end were a shade dearer. A drop in quality contributed to cheaper prices for the medium weight yearling heifers on a cheaper market trend. The heavy weight feeders saw little but a quality related change on an otherwise firm trend.

Heavy grown steers sold to a slightly dearer trend for a slightly drop in quality. The best of the grown heifers to process followed a similar trend. The overall quality of the cows on offer was not as good as the previous sale and this was reflected in price. The market trend was a shade cheaper for the most part."
