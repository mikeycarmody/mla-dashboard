Commentary
"A welcome 40mm and more in places of precipitation over the past 5 days in the drawing area saw agents yard 676 cattle, exactly the same as last week. A big school holiday crowd was on hand although not all of the regular buyers were at the rail effecting competition in some grades.

Light weaner steers saw invigorated competition on the back of the rainfall selling from 352c to 432c/kg to be 8c/kg dearer, medium weights saw similar gains making to 418c/kg whilst over 330kg made from 320c to 406c/kg to be 9c/kg better off. Best local butcher calf made 378c/kg weighing 395kg. Weaner heifers reversed this trend to be 29c/kg cheaper trading from 260c to 324c/kg over 330kg grain assisted trade heifers slightly dearer making from 290c to 378c/kg.

Yearling steers medium weights to re-stockers were back 17c/kg selling from 270c to 388c/kg, heavy weights over 400kg to the lot feeders selling from 306c to 370c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed saw little change making from 280c to 322c/kg.

Only a handful of cows on offer too unreliable to quote with light 2 scores selling from 160c to 264c/kg whilst the heavy prime 3 and 4 scores sold from 288c to 310c/kg.
