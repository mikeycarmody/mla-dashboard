Commentary
"There were approximately 250 export and 40 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 340 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a cheaper market in places. Quality declined with fewer prime lots and a larger proportion of secondary cattle. Trade cattle eased 10c/kg and more in places where quality was lacking. Manufacturing steers lost 12c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold firm. Cows eased 3c to 5c/kg on most sales. Heavy bulls lost 10c to 20c/kg. 

Yearling trade steers sold from 310c to 328c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade sold between 292c and 310c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks made from 310c to 323c/kg. Manufacturing steers sold from 266c to 310c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made between 189c and 236c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly between 215c and 276c/kg. Heavy bulls made from 260c to 288c/kg.
