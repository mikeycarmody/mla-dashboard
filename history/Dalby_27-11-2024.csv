Commentary
"Cattle numbers at Dalby climbed to the highest in the nation this week with 7,471 head penned a lift of 4,166 from the previous week. Buyer representation was good and all were active in the market. Despite the larger numbers buyers were able to absorb the increase in supply plus lift prices across a number of young cattle classes. However export lines of bullocks and cows experienced very little change in price. 

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock averaged 14c to 30c/kg better. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed lifted in price by 11c to 17c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers returning to the paddock averaged 4c/kg dearer. Yearling heifers to feed were over 20c/kg better in places.

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock made to 456c on a number of occasions to average from 398c to 411c/kg. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market averaged 389c with a run of 196 head making 410c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed made to 406c to average 386c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers made to 352c to average from 300c to 310c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed averaged 340c with a run of 183 head making 368c/kg. Heavy weight yearling heifers to feed made to 366c to average 324c/kg.
  
Bullocks made to 354c to average 338c/kg. A large selection of full mouth bullocks made to 330c to average 307c/kg with some returning $2,679/head. Plain condition cows returning to the paddock made to 247c to average 240c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows averaged 255c and made to 268c/kg. Heavy weight 3 score cows averaged 276c and the best of the cows averaged 288c and sold to 295c/kg.  Heavy weight bulls to processors made to 290c/kg.
