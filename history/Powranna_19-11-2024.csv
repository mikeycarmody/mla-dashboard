Commentary
"There was a smaller yarding of 182 trade and export cattle with about a third being cows. Quality was mixed and although slightly cheaper most yearlings met good butcher and restocker competition. The best yearling steers made 260c to 300c, secondary 220c to 245c, best heifers 250c to 300c and seconds 210c to 260c.

Grown steers made 254c to 278c and heavy export heifers 240c to 268c.

There was a smaller number of 60 cows with quality not as good and prices were cheaper with the best heavy cows making 210c to 247c, leaner 170c to 220c and very lean 38c to 102c/kg liveweight.
