Commentary
"Inverell penned similar numbers at 1007 very good quality cattle. This was very noticeable through the yearling cattle with extra weight in the heavier categories. Cow quality also improved showing good gains in the final results although there were limited cow buyers. Trends were stronger through all categories.

Weaners met with strong demand from restockers 420c/kg the steers and 338c/kg the heifer drafts. Light steers to background were firm with the heavier drafts seeing rises of 20c/kg. Medium weights gained 18c/kg topping at 398c/kg. Heavy yearling feeder steers posted very strong gains. Yearling heifers sold to mostly dearer trends with light feeders gaining 11c/kg and medium weights also dearer at 332c/kg. Heavy yearling heifers to process gained 20c/kg.

Heavy grown heifers to process were up to 11c/kg better. Cows sold to strong trends medium cows  dearer and heavy cows 11c to 16c/kg better making 330c/kg. There were PTIC cows making 238c to 262c/kg. Heavy bulls slightly dearer  selling to 271c/kg.
