Commentary
"The supply of cattle fell by more than 700 for a yarding of 2450 cattle. Quality was very mixed, with fewer numbers of good prime cows and several small lines of store cattle.  Buyer attendance was good with one additional southern processor and several opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from Burketown and Normanton, south to The Belyando, local and coastal areas.

Firm demand for many classes saw quality related price changes, with better quality lines improving 5c to 15c/kg. Light steers and heifers met limited demand, while yearling steers returning to the paddock improved 30c to 50c/kg.

Young steers to restockers averaged 246c, selling to 264c, similar heifers to processors averaged 160c/kg.  Light yearling steers to restockers made to 266c, averaging 220c to 258c and steers above 280kg averaged 200c/kg. A good sample of steers above 400kg to feed sold to and averaged 238c/kg. A large sample of heifers above 200kg returning to the paddock reached 228c to average 201c and heifers above 280kg averaged 195c/kg. Yearling heifers above 400kg to the trade sold to 238c to average 228c/kg.

Grown steers above 400kg to feed made to 232c to average 213c, steers to processors reached 235c to average from 224c to 230c/kg. Grown heifers to the trade made to 218c to average 213c/kg.

An increased supply of heavy bullocks to export slaughter topped at an isolated 250c, the majority averaging 225c to 231c/kg. A larger offering of lightweight 2 score cows to processors sold to 172c to average 162c, medium weight 2 score cows made to 180c to average 171c and 3 score cows reached 210c to average from 184c to 194c/kg. A good sample of prime heavyweight cows topped at 224c to average 206c/kg. Medium weight bulls to feed destined for live export sold to 226c, most sales from 184c to 218c, a small number heavy bulls sold to 210c/kg.

Small mixed quality lines of cows and calves sold from $850 to $1,025/unit.
