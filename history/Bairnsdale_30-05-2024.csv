Commentary
"There were approximately 410 export and 50 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 620 head from the sale of a fortnight ago. Quality was limited with cows representing more than half of the sale. Young cattle were in short supply and were mostly swept up by restockers. Bullocks lifted 10c/kg. Heavy grown heifers eased 14c/kg. Cows gave back 10c to 25c/kg. Heavy bulls lost 15c/kg. 

A handful of vealers made 330c/kg. Yearling heifers to restockers averaged 269c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks made between 295c and 330c/kg. Manufacturing steers sold between 230c and 300c/kg. Heavy grown heifers with finish made from 260c to 275c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 91c to 203c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 160c and 251c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 180c and 245c/kg.
