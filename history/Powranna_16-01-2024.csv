Commentary
"There was a small yarding of trade and export cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with a better selection of yearlings that attracted stronger competition. The best yearling steers made 220c to 248c and heifers 230c to 252c/kg.
The few bullocks made 244c to 249c while the heavy cows sold for 192c to 198c and the seconds 156c to 172c/kg liveweight.
