Commentary
"The numbers remained steady with another large offloading of young cattle. There was a fair supply of heavy grown cattle along with a good selection of cows. Overall the quality of the young cattle was good and condition variable. There were some bigger lines of feeder and restocker cattle along with the usual penning of plainer and secondary quality yearlings. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Light weight steers to restockers sold to a slightly cheaper trend with the medium and heavy weights to restock and feed following a similar trend. The price gap between the light weight heifers and their steer counterparts closed slightly with the heifers selling on  a firm to dearer trend with an improvement in quality. The medium and heavy weights to restock and feed saw trends generally firm with an odd slightly dearer sale.

There were not many well finished heavy grown steers to suit processors with the market firm to cheaper. Most of the price change was quality and age related. There was little change in the well finished grown heifers to process. The cow market showed an improvement under strong demand with all classes selling to a dearer trend. A good supply of heavy bulls sold to dearer trends."
