Total Yarding: 5390 (+290)
Commentary
"The numbers keep rolling in with a yarding of 5390. It was a pretty good quality yarding with good numbers of prime cattle in all sections along with good numbers of young cattle to suit the feeders. There were larger numbers of far western cattle in this sale which were mostly in forward to prime condition. Not all the regular buyers were operating resulting in a much cheaper market throughout.
 
Young cattle to the trade were considerably cheaper with prime yearlings selling from 260c to 346c/kg. Feeder steers were 18c to 30c cheaper while the feeder heifers were up to 45c/kg cheaper. Feeder steers sold from 320c to 384c while the feeder heifers sold from 270c to 331c/kg. The few young cattle suitable for the restockers and backgrounders sold to fair competition with the young restocker steers selling from 288c to 476c while the young restocker heifers sold to 410c/kg.
 
Grown steers were 20c to 30c cheaper while the grown heifers were up to 40c/kg cheaper. Prime grown steers sold from 290c to 355c while the prime grown heifers sold from 290c to 332c/kg. Cows were 14c to 25c cheaper with the prime heavy weights selling from 275c to 303c/kg. 2 and 3 score cows sold from 180c to 288c/kg. Young Angus cows PTIC to the Limousin bull sold to the restockers from 266c to 328c/kg. Bulls were close to firm selling to 320c/kg.
