Commentary
"Numbers increased for a yarding of 1,840 head. The main increase  was in the yarding of cows with the largest offering for several years.  There was also a good supply of yearlings and a few less weaners this week.  Overall quality was good with a larger number of crop finished cattle through the sale.

The yarding of young cattle consisted mainly of well bred and well finished yearlings, with the largest percentage suitable for backgrounders and feeder buyers.  Vendors were well rewarded this week with all classes of cattle selling on a stronger market.  Restocker weaner steers were 10c dearer selling from 344c to 408c/kg.  The good run of feeder steers were 10c to 15c dearer ranging from 336c to 380c while feeder heifers experienced similar gains selling from 298c to 368c/kg.

The yarding of export cattle consisted of several pens of well finished heavy grown steers and heifers.  Grown steers were 30c to 35c dearer selling from 318c to 368c, while grown heifers gained 20c ranging from 293c to 328c/kg.  The large yarding of cows consisted of good runs of heavy high yielding cows,a good percentage crop finished.  The market was firm to 5c dearer with 2 scores selling from 205c to 268c while 3 scores averaged 276c and 4 score cows sold from 294c to 317c/kg.  There was a very strong bull market with best of the heavy bulls reaching a top price of 334c/kg.
