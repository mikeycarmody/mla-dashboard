Total Yarding: 462 (-377)
Commentary
"Extreme heat the main factor in a much smaller yarding of 462 cattle as overnight storms dumped an even 25mm in the drawing area. In a very mixed yarding which did see some excellent grain assisted vealers and yearlings the balance comprised of small lots and singles along with a handfull of cows. There were mixed market trends throughout.
 
Light weight weaner steers rose 21c/kg selling from 280c to 428c/kg, medium weights 308c to 402c/kg with heavier types to the trade making up to 368c/kg. Weaner heifers made from 248c to 324c/kg to be around 15c/kg cheaper, over 330kg to feed sold from 296c to 364c/kg.
 
Medium weight yearling steers to feed were 15c/kg cheaper selling from 310c to 378c/kg over 400kg sold from 312c to 350c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers on the back of breeding and condition rose 13c/kg to the lot feeders trading from 300c to 322c/kg.
 
The few cows were mixed in quality and condition, 2 scores made from 220c to 260c/kg, heavy prime 3 and 4 scores were back 20c/kg selling from 260c to 275c/kg.
