Commentary
"Despite good rainfall totals throughout the drawing area agents managed to yard 1039 cattle a slight increase on last week. Cow numbers were just about cut in half with the bulk of the yarding comprising mainly of well-bred British and Euro weaners. All of the regular buyers were at the rail operating to mixed market trends.
 
Light weaner steers back 19c/kg selling from 300c to 414c/kg averaging 368c/kg, medium weights only slightly cheaper trading from 320c to 438c/kg. Over 330kg to domestic lot feeder orders saw little change averaging 385c/kg. Light weaner heifers were back 14c/kg selling from 238c to 326c/kg, medium weights similar falls trading from 278c to 318c/kg. There were slim pickings for local butcher orders over 330kg with enough fat cover and they made up to 340c/kg.
 
Over 400kg yearling feeder steers improved by 6c/kg selling from 336c to 408c/kg. There were limited numbers of heavy Bullocks, grown Steers and Heifers for the processors and they sold from 226c to 330c/kg.
 
Re-stocker interest in light 2 score Cows saw dearer trends of 6c/kg making from 170c to 288c/kg whilst heavy prime Cows slipped 9c/kg trading from 280c to a top of 310c/kg. Only one heavy B muscle Bull on offer and he made 282c/kg to head back to the paddock.
