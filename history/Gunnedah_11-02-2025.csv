Commentary
"A localised rain event saw numbers fall by more than half. Young cattle and cows made up the majority in an offering where both quality and condition was fair to good. There was a reduced gallery of buyers in attendance, mostly from the restocker and feeder ranks.

There were limited supplies of vealers with the steers dearer and the heifer portion cheaper. Lightweight yearling steers to restock saw averages down however this was a breed related change. The medium and heavyweight yearling steers to restock and feed experienced little change that wasnâ€™t quality related. There were odd dearer sales, breed specific.yearling heifers sold on a generally firm market trend where the reduced supply impacted positively on price change.

Well finished grown heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend while there was some improvement in the cow market where all attending processors competed strongly whilst endeavouring to secure supply requirements."
