Commentary
"There was another small yarding of trade and export cattle with very few cows in comparison with last week. Following interstate trends all prices improved with trade cattle 10c to 20c dearer with steers making 270c to 288c and heifers 234c to 272c/kg.
Good quality grown steers and bullocks made 260c to 270c while crossbreds made 220c to 240c/kg.
The best cows improved 30c/kg to make 216c to 226c and the seconds 192c to 196c and heavy bulls 140c/kg liveweight.
