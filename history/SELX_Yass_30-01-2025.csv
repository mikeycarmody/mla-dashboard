Commentary
"Numbers lifted and the quality was mixed with very few prime trades and only a few well finished grown steers and heifers. Most of the yearling cattle went to feeder orders and the few pens of weaners returned to the paddock. Around 170 cows were penned and the market sold to a cheaper trend with most feeders back 20c to 30c with only a couple of heavy 3 score pens holding firm. Bullocks and prime grown heifers dropped 30c and heavy cows dipped 8c to 10c but the lighter and plainer 2 score cows lost 25c/kg.
 
The few pens of weaner steers were under 200kg reached 402c and heavier weaner heifers reached 295c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers ranged from 270c to 346c and forward conditioned 3 score heavy weights reached 360c/kg. Most feeder heifers ranged from 245c to 298c and heavy weights topped at 303c/kg.
 
Grown steers and bullocks mainly sold from 310c to 325c and prime heavy grown heifers reached 298c/kg. Heavy cows mostly sold between 262c and 282c and the medium weight 2 score sold from 200c to 252c/kg."
