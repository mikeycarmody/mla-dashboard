Commentary
"There were approximately 270 export and 70 young cattle penned representing an increase of 96 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a dearer market. Quality remained limited with a few more prime lots and a smaller proportion of cows. The trade cattle were mostly heifers which sold 30c/kg dearer. The limited selection of grown sold up to 13c/kg dearer. Cows kicked 20c to 30c/kg. Heavy bulls improved 23c/kg. 

Yearling steers to restockers sold from 240c to 324c/kg. Yearling heifers suited to the trade made between 300c and 318c/kg. Heavy grown heifers sold between 280c and 310c/kg. Manufacturing steers made from 274c to 330c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 180c to 267c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 246c and 303c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 216c and 275c/kg.
