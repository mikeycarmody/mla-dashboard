Commentary
"Cattle numbers increased slightly to 392 penned. Quality was again patchy, ranging from plain to good. All the usual buying group attended in a market with mixed results. Better quality young cattle were offered and lifted 40c in places, while the plainer types slipped 10c/kg. Grown steers and heifers were in limited supply and sold 10c to 20c/kg softer.  Heavy cows slipped to 30c, while the medium and light weights sold 12c/kg cheaper.  Bulls were also very limited in numbers with too few to quote.
 
Young steers sold to the trade from 310c to 380c for the better quality and the plainer types made from 200c to 306c/kg. Young heifers made from 200c to 330c and feeders and restockers paid from 312c to 406c for the well bred steers and 310c to 354c/kg for the heifer portion, while the plainer secondary types made from 168c to 250c/kg.  Grown Steers made from 280c to 350c, grown heifers sold to the trade from 260c to 320c, while restockers and feeders paid from 200c to 282c/kg. Manufacturing Beef steers made from 244c to 300c/kg.
 
Heavy cows sold from 258c to 318c/kg. Medium weights cows made from 180c to 255c and the light weights made from 100c to 200c/kg.  Dairy cows sold to 180c/kg. A limited offering of bulls with heavy bulls selling to 288c, the lighter and younger bulls made from 174c to 292c/kg.
