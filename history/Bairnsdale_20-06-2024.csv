Commentary
"There were approximately 540 export and 45 young cattle penned representing an increase of 90 head from the sale of a fortnight ago. An export order rejoined the regulars after a long absence and all were more selective in a cheaper market. Quality declined with fewer prime cattle and a larger proportion of cows. A few finished vealers sold to firm demand while most young cattle lost 20c to 40c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks eased 15c/kg however a few heavy weights were passed in. Manufacturing steers gave back 10c to 20c/kg. Cows slipped 30c to 60c/kg and more in places. Heavy bulls sold firm. 

Vealers sold from 220c to 360c/kg. Yearling heifers suited to the trade made between 223c and 298c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold between 240c and 310c/kg. 

Heavy manufacturing steers made from 180c to 300c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 100c to 205c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 150c and 246c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 200c and 245c/kg.
