Feeder steers were 10c to 15c cheaper while the feeder heifers were firm to 5c/kg cheaper. Feeder steers sold from 336c to 410c while the feeder heifers sold from 320c to 366c/kg.
 
Grown steers were up to 14c cheaper while the grown heifers were firm to 4c/kg dearer. Prime grown steers sold from 346c to 389c while the prime grown heifers sold from 334c to 368c/kg.
