Commentary
"Numbers lifted by 468 for a yarding of 1443 cattle. Quality was good with large supplies of feeder weights and heavy prime cattle. There were limited numbers of lightweight cattle and cows. All the regular buyers were present, and the market sold to a stronger trend.

Young cattle to the trade were 5c to 10c dearer, prime yearling steers sold from 320c to 354c, and prime yearling heifers, 255c to 350c/kg. Feeder steers gained 8c, 300c to 380c, and feeder heifers were up 10c, 240c to 343c/kg.

Prime grown steers were 3c dearer, 270c to 342c, while prime grown heifers eased 5c, 272c to 323c/kg. Cows were firm to slightly dearer, 2 and 3 scores sold from 262c to 278c, and heavy prime cows, 272c to 285c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 284c/kg.
