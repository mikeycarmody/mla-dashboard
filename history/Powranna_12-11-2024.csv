Commentary
"There was a much larger yarding of 270 trade and grown cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with many more yearlings and cows included.
The quality of trade cattle was good and even with bigger numbers the market was only a few cents cheaper with the exception being the secondary types that were harder to sell.
Yearling steers made 280c to 320c, seconds 220c to 230c while the best heifers made 270c to 332c with the seconds 150c to 250c/kg.

The few grown steers averaged 45c cheaper making 258c to 280c. There were about 150 cows and this market was 40c to 50c cheaper with heavy cows making 218c to 242c, leaner 170c to 200c and very lean 100c to 160c/kg liveweight.
