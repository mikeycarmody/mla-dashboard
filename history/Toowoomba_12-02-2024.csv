Yearling steers under 330kg sold to restockers at an average of 394c with sales to 398c/kg. Medium weight yearling steers to feed made to 368c to average 350c/kg. Yearling heifers under 200kg made to 382c to average 371c/kg. A mixed quality line up of yearling heifers under 280kg returning to the paddock averaged 287c and made to 296c/kg.
