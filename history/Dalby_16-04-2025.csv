Commentary
"The approaching run of short working weeks reduced the number of cattle at Dalby by 1,760 head to 4,072. The restrictions on stock movements from the far west of the state is still evident however 360 head from New South Wales were included in the lineup. The turnoff of cows and heifers experienced at most selling centres across the nation continued at Dalby. The regular panel of buyers was present and active across all classes.

Light weight yearling steers and heifers to restockers experienced only quality related price changes with well bred lines receiving strong support. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed averaged 13c to 15c/kg better. Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to feed improved in price by 10c to 12c/kg. All classes of cows experienced a stronger market to average 5c to 6c/kg dearer.

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock made to a top of 500c with a large sample averaging 446c/kg. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market made to 444c with most sales from 399c to 415c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed averaged 391c with a very isolated sale to 440c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers returning to the paddock made to 380c to average 330c and poor quality lines averaged 274c/kg. Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to feed averaged 350c and sold to 380c/kg. 

A handful of bullocks made to 367c and heavy export heifers made to 366c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows averaged 269c and made to 275c/kg. Heavy weight 3 score cows averaged 289c and the best of the heavy weight cows made to a top of 322c with a fair sample at 307c/kg. Heavy weight bulls were dearer and made to 356c/kg.
