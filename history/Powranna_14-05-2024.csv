Commentary
"There was a slightly smaller number of 150 trade and grown cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with fewer cows in the mix.
Yearlings met a subdued market with steers making 184c to 220c and heifers 200c to 206c. Good quality grown steers made 220c to 230c while Friesian bullocks made 118c/kg.

There was a much smaller yarding of just over 50 cows and store buyers were strong on all suitable types. Heavy beef cows made 172c to 183c, leaner 140c to 160c and very lean 80c to 140c. The few heavy bulls made 134c to 150c/kg liveweight.
