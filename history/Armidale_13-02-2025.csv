Commentary
"There was a sharp drop in supply on the back of some very useful storm rain over the past fortnight. It was a very mixed quality penning where condition also varied greatly. There was more processor competition this week however the ranks are still not at capacity. Restocker and feedlot competition was also down.

Lightweight young cattle to restockers saw the steers sell to a dearer trend with some breed and quality related price change. The heifer portion mostly firm with quality also affecting price change. The medium and heavy weights sold on a firm to cheaper trend with the good quality lots least affected.

A very mixed quality penning of grown cattle to suit processors. The well finished heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend under the extra competition. Well finished grown heifers also sold to dearer trends however the plainer quality lots were cheaper. Demand was high in the cow market with processors competing strongly. All classes showing strong gains. Heavy bulls sold on a firm to cheaper trend with quality variations accounting for positive price change."
