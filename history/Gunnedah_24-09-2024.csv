Commentary
"There was a further increase in numbers with females again dominating supply. Yearlings steers were also well represented. The quality and condition of the offering was generally good with very few lacking condition in the face of favourable seasonal conditions. Whilst there were quite a few straight lines of feeder cattle there were also plenty of mixed breed pens. There was little in the way of domestic trade competition however all the regular export processor and feedlot orders were in place.

There were varying trends through the yearling cattle with light weight steers cheaper for the most part with limited availability. Medium weight steers to restock and feed also sold to a slightly cheaper trend with some quality related price change. The heavy weight feeder steers saw a firm to slightly cheaper trend with large numbers easing any supply issues. There were cheaper trends through the light and medium weight yearling heifers with those on the higher end of the condition scores not as keenly sought as previously. Any positive price change was related to an improvement in quality. The concern of too much condition was not as obvious on the heavy weight feeder heifers with the market trend firm with an odd dearer sale.

Demand for well finished heavy cattle was not as strong with both the heavy grown steers and heifers to process selling to cheaper trends. Grown steers and heifers to feed also sold to cheaper trends. Market trends were cheaper for the most part through the cow market where an odd sale remained firm. There was also some quality related improvement in places. A large number of bulls presented with market trends cheaper."
