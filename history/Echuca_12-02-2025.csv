Commentary
"Supply lifted to 1400 head, and once again there was a wide range of cattle quality in regards to fat cover, weight and breed type. The highlight in this market was much keener domestic processor support, with buyers prepared go with auctioneer asking prices on the lead runs of fed steers and heifers. Bidding for any straight bred beef store calves and yearling feeders also lifted, particularly for lighter weight types which had struggled a week ago. Price gains across the young cattle yarding were in the vicinity of 10c to 30c/kg dearer compared to a week ago. There was also some price improvement for export and manufacturing cattle, but it was more modest at less than 10c for most categories.  Overall, saleyard data showed an average price of 308c/kg over all cattle sold across the yarding, compared to a baseline of 283c/kg last Wednesday.

The best high yielding trade steers and heifers sold from 360c to 397c/kg, with a stand out Limousin steer weighing 430kg topping the sale at 400c/kg. Underneath this was a run of handy trade types with less yield at 320c to 360c/kg. The price average for good C-muscle steers in the 330-480kg weight range was about 375c/kg, while similar sized heifers with muscle averaged 356c/kg. Some heavier fed steers weighing over 500kg topped at 388c/kg. The rate for most of the better bred steers and heifers which sold to restockers was 310c to 360c/kg. But noting demand was still selective for off-bred types or young cattle with horns or temperament issues and these still tracked under 300c/kg.

There was a lot of crossbred manufacturing types steers and heifers in the yarding. Most sold from 220c to 290c/kg, out to a top of about 320c for better covered types with some shape. Restockers were active on crossbred cattle with frame but lacking fat cover. Cow price averages improved slightly, driven up by better results on the plainer types. The heaviest cows remained in a range of 275c to 300c/kg. Leaner and lighter cows mostly 200c to 265c/kg. Most secondary dairy types down to 110c/kg.
