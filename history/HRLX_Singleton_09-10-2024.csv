Commentary
"Cool conditions and light drizzle greeted buyers this morning as Singleton agents yarded 703 primarily well-bred cattle. There were some outstanding lines of crop and grain assisted weaners and yearlings in amongst some lighter 2 score types. Not all the regular buyers present in a market that saw fluctuating fortunes throughout the grades.
 
Light weaner steers were 10c/kg back more in places selling from 298c to 450c/kg the latter for highly sought after Angus breed, over 330kg topping at 370c/kg. Weaner heifers sold from 250c to 296c/kg to be 16c/kg off the pace whilst local trade heifers over 330kg were 10c/kg dearer selling from 292c to 346c/kg.
 
Yearling steers medium weights 5c/kg dearer selling from 270c to 376c/kg averaging 351c/kg, over 400kg to the lot feeders making from 310c to 348c/kg. Yearling heifers over 400kg took a hit as lack of suitable numbers prevented some buyers from operating and those destined for the feed lot sold from 266c to 296c/kg.
 
A bigger selection of 2 score cows this week selling from 196c to 268c/kg to be 23c/kg dearer whilst heavy 3 and 4 scores reversed that trend selling from 266c to 305c/kg. Best heavy b muscle Bull topped at 312c/kg.
