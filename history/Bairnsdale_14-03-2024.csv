Commentary
"There were approximately 300 export and 75 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 180 head from the sale of a fortnight ago. Quality declined with secondary and plainer cattle well supplied and the limited selection of prime cattle mostly lacking finish. Trade cattle slipped 20c to 40c/kg with several pens passed in. Heavy manufacturing steers eased 5c/kg. Grown steers lost 5c to 10c/kg. Cows gave back 15c to 25c/kg. Heavy bulls lost 13c/kg. 

Vealers sold from 220c to 280c/kg. A couple of yearling trade steers reached 265c with the heifer portion up to 260c/kg. A few pens of grown steers made between 280c and 282c/kg. 

Heavy manufacturing steers sold between 198c and 280c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made from 73c to 200c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly from 150c to 239c/kg. Heavy bulls made between 190c and 232c/kg.
