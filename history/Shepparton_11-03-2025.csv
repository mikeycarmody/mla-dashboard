Commentary
"There were 1085 exports and 585 trade cattle offered, amongst the exports were 480 cows. It was noticeable that several feedlotters and store buyers were absent and some processors were present but not operating. 

The trade quality was very mixed with weights also highly variable. Prices for the heavy cattle with cover and shape sold at stronger rates as C4 bullocks rebounded 10 to 20c/kg. Both beef and dairy cows lifted slightly after last weeks heavy falls to be 5 to 10c/kg dearer. 

Top calves lifted, the best of the vealers reached 400c/kg. The B & C muscled yearling steers ranged from 320c to 408c/kg to average 386c/kg. The better end of the yearling heifer portion made from 320c to 417c/kg to average 350c/kg. 

The finished grown steers were not in abundance but still had some good lines presented. The 400 to 500kg steers made from 270c to 369c/kg. The 500 to 600kg C3 and C4 steers ranged from 374c to 390c/kg, with the 600kg plus steers C3 and C4 made from 360c to 390c/kg.

The heavy beef cows made from 265c to 310c/kg and the heavy dairy cows made from 228c to 265c/kg."
