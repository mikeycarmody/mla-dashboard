Commentary
"Inverell penned 1100 mostly good quality cattle to a market resulting in mixed trends with quality corrections through some categories. All the regular buyers attended with strong interest for drafts of background cattle.

Weaner steers considerably dearer as were the heifers which lifted 19c/kg and both categories going to restockers. Light yearling steers to 28c/kg better 330c to 400c/kg to backgrounders. Heavier drafts to feed on were 11c/kg cheaper however similar weights to background were dearer 374c to 426c/kg. Medium weight steers lost ground to be 13c/kg back. Heavy yearling steers to feed gained 28c/kg making to 355c/kg. Light heifers to background were significantly dearer 298c to 326c/kg and similar weights to feed on much dearer selling to 324c/kg. Medium weight feeder heifers sold to 351c/kg and were considerably dearer. Similar weight heifers to the trade declined 6c/kg to sell to 338c/kg.

Heavy grown steers were dearer 324c to 360c/kg the heifer counterparts to 20c/kg better. Medium cows were firm. A large offering of heavy cows were only slightly cheaper 293c to 319/kg. Heavy bulls gained 13c/kg and ranged 250c to 278c/kg.
