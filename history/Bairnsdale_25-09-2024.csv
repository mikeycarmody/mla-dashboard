Commentary
"There were 74 export and 13 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 100 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a cheaper market. Quality was limited to a handful of trade heifers as cows represented most of the sale. Heifers to the trade eased 17c/kg. Light conditioned dairy cows sold firm while a plainer offering of heavy beef cows eased 10c/kg. Heavy bulls lost 4c/kg. 

Yearling heifers to the trade sold from 320c to 330c/kg. Light and medium weight cows made between 175c and 315c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold between 247c and 324c/kg. Heavy bulls made from 280c to 334c/kg.
