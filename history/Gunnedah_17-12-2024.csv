Commentary
"Yearlings steers made up a large percentage in a greatly reduced offering. There were very few grown cattle while cows were in fair numbers. The quality of the offering was very mixed. Condition also varied with a lot of the young cattle showing the effects of the drier feed conditions. There was a reduced field of buyers throughout.

Demand from restockers for light weight steers was strong with the market trend generally dearer. The medium and heavy weights sold to a cheaper trend, however there was not a lot in it when taking quality variation into account. There was a big drop in quality through the yearling heifers. Light weights to restockers sold on a firm to slightly dearer market trend. The medium weights were also a shade dearer. The few heavy weights sold to a slightly cheaper trend.

Too few grown cattle to quote a trend. The cow market was slightly cheaper under the reduced processor attendance."
