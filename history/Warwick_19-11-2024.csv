Commentary
"With only one sale left for the year the supply of stock lifted by 591 head to 1,674 at Warwick. All the regular buyers attended and operated in a yarding that was dominated by export and heavy feeder lines with only a small sample of light weight yearling cattle. All the bullocks and cows sold to a very strong market and any price variations were attributed to quality and finish.
