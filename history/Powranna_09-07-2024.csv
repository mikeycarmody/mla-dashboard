Commentary
"There was a larger yarding of 92 trade and export cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with much better quality in the trade and grown steer sections. With an extra buyer plus strong local interest prices were 20c to 30c higher with yearling steers making 208c to 278c and heifers 208c to 252c. The grown steers made 242c to 266c and heavy export heifers 244c to 266c.

There was a very small number of cows and the best heavy pens made 180c to 206c an improvement of 17c/kg.
