Commentary
"A total of 1,150 head of cattle were yarded at the Blackall Prime and store sale this week. Quality remained mixed however some good pens of prime cows and a very good line of medium weight steers and heifers met strong competition. The addition of an extra southern processor saw prices continue to improve for prime cows. 

Local restockers pushed along steers 280 to 300kg to a top of 368.2c to average 321c while those 330 to 400kg returning to the paddock sold to 352.2c to average 330c/kg. 

A very good line of medium weight restocker heifers 280 to 330kg made to 304.2c to average 272c and backrounders paid up to 300.2c for those over 330kg, to average 287c/kg.

The highlight of the sale was an improvement of 50c/kg across the board for prime cows with medium weights selling to 268.2c to average 244c and good heavy 3 score cows over 520kg sold to a top of 280.2c to average 259c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 244.2c to average 220c/kg.
