Commentary
"There were large numbers of yearlings and more well finished heavy grown steers to suit the export processors than have been seen recently in an increased penning. The quality of the offering was generally good while the majority of the offering were in good condition. There was a full field of buyers in operation.

Strong demand from restockers resulted in the light weight steers selling to dearer trends with odd sales showing strong gains. The medium and heavy weights to restock and feed sold on a firm to slightly dearer trend under solid competition. Well finished heavy yearling steers into the Supermarket trade were a shade cheaper. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers sold to a slightly cheaper trend with buyers prepared to pay as much as 100c/kg more for similar weight steers. There was little but quality related price change on a generally firm market trend for medium and heavy weights to restock and feed with the price gap between steers and heifers was not as great.

Grown steers to feed were keenly sought with the majority carrying 2 teeth. Well finished heavy grown steers to export processors sold on a firm trend for the most part with age a factor in price change. Well finished grown heifers to the same destination saw a slightly dearer trend. There was little change in the market through the middle run of cows while the better heavy weights sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend."
