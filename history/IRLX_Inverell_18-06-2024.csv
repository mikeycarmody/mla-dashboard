Commentary
"There was a a larger yarding of 1,366 head which was a increase of 327, consisting of a good supply of young cattle and a larger penning of cows.  Grown steers and heifers were in smaller numbers.  The yarding of young cattle consisted of several pens of weaners however, yearling cattle made the largest percentage of the young cattle yarding.  Quality was mixed with some good runs of well bred steers and heifers through the sale, along with a few pens of plainer grades.

The market varied considerably again this week with breed  and weight determining the out come of prices.  Restocker weaner steers were 10c to 20c cheaper selling from 182c to 360c,while restocker weaner heifers were back by 10c selling from 212c to 290c/kg.  Feeder steers were firm to slightly easier , with weight and breed  once again  having a bearing on prices, selling firm to slightly easier, ranging from 260c to 376c/kg.  Yearling heifers went against the market trend with increased buyer competition helping to keep prices relatively firm.  Feeder heifers ranged from 240c to 312c.kg.

The yarding of export cattle consisted of a mixed quality offering with the small penning of grown steers reaching a top price of 260c to process and heifers toped at 220c/kg.  The larger yarding of cows consisted of several pens of heavy well finished cows, however there was increased numbers of plain cows through the sale this week.  The market was back by 20c for heavy cows, with plainer grades affected the most.  The 2 score cows sold from 128c to 184c, while 3 scores averaged  188c and heavy 4 score cows ranged from 186c to 215c/kg.
