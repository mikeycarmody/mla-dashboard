Commentary
"The supply of cattle increased by almost 1,000 for a yarding of 3714. Quality was mostly good, consisting of some large lines of well finished heavy cows and small lines of heavy bullocks, supported by an increased number of good quality store steers and heifers. Cattle were drawn from Burketown to Mt Isa, Richmond, Hughenden, Georgetown, Mt Coolon, local and coastal areas. The buyer panel increased with additional southern processor activity, supported by opportunity feeders, central backgrounders and restockers.

Increased demand from the buyer gallery resulted in price improvements for most categories. Yearling steers rose by up to 30c, yearling heifers to feed lifted 3c to 5c/kg. Bullocks were mostly firm, grown steers to the trade lifted 17c to 24c, grown heifers improved 23c, lightweight cows lifted 13c to 24c, heavy cows improved by 8c and bulls averaged up to 30c higher.

Young suitably weaned steers returning to the paddock averaged 277c to 294c selling to 310c, similar heifers to grass reached 256c, averaging from 244c to 250c and heifers to processors averaged 241c/kg.  Yearling steers above 280kg to feed averaged 253c to 269c, with backgrounder steers averaging 270c/kg. Steers above 330kg to feed eased, selling to 328c to average 280c, while a sample of steers above 400kg averaged 305c/kg. Best bred lines of yearling heifers above 200kg to feed sold to 258c to average 256c and heifers above 280kg reached 274c to average 256c/kg. A small quantity of prime yearling heifers to the trade made to 298c to average above 290c/kg.

A good sample of grown steers above 400kg to the trade averaged 315c selling to 328c, prime grown heifers sold to 296c to average 290c/kg.  An increased supply of heavy full mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 328c to average from 312 to 325c/ kg.
Lightweight 2 score cows to processors sold to an improved 262c to average 243c, medium weight 2 scores averaged 257c, 3 score cows averaged from 265c to 275c and a good supply of prime heavyweight 3 and 4 score cows topped at 294c to  average 287c/kg.  Heavy bulls to processors reached 268c, most around 240c/kg.

A small number of cows and calves sold from $650 per unit to $1,450 for cows with large weaners at foot.
