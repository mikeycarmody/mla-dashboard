Commentary
"Dearer market over a similar sized yarding of 1403 head. Export cows led the rise, gaining 30c/kg on a week ago. Matching this stronger trend was manufacturing grades likes crossbred steers, with heavy heifers also recoding significant price improvements. Trade and younger yearlings and steers lifted by 10c to 30c/kg, with the most support on the best quality types which remained in limited numbers as the yarding was again dominated by a lot of store or feeder conditioned types. Overall the sale showed a lot more bidding activity with a full buying gallery operating.  The peak of the market was 416c/kg for an outstanding heifer that weighed 430kg and showed exceptional muscle. The average price over all cattle sold in the yarding was 337c/kg lwt, for a lift of 30c/kg on a week ago according to saleyard data.

Some exceptional grainfed Limousin and Charolais sired steers and heifers, showing a lot of carcass shape and yield potential, sold from 380c to a top of 416c/kg. There was seven sales over 400/kg. After this any reasonably bred and presented steers and heifers tracked in a range of 320c to 375c/kg, selling to processors, feedlots and restockers. The average price for the good yearling feeder steers was 362c/kg lwt. There was stronger support in this sale for any heifers that offered fat cover and shape, the better types 340c to 370c/kg for most. However there was still some buyer reluctance towards plainer shaped or bred grassy heifers at 260c to 315c/kg.

Good beef cows consistently sold from 290c to 331c/kg with the main categories averaging over 300c/kg. Leaner and lighter cows 240c to 285c/kg for most, a few very secondary types down to 148c/kg. There was a step-up in price for manufacturing steers, crossbreds with size and reasonable fat cover from 300c to 360c/kg. Dairy steers 240c to 280c/kg on plain quality.
