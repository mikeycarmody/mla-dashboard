Commentary
"There were approximately 230 export and 70 young cattle penned representing an increase of 90 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a dearer market. Quality was limited with a reasonable selection of heifers while cows made up over half of the sale. Yearling trade heifers lifted 32c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks improved 30c/kg. Cows sold 20c to 40c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls gained 7c/kg. 

A handful of vealers sold from 240c to 388c/kg. Yearling trade heifers made between 300c and 370c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold between 290c and 350c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made from 206c to 265c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly from 220c to 315c/kg. Heavy bulls made between 240c and 270c/kg. 

Market reporter: Brendan Fletcher."
