Commentary
"There were approximately 240 export and 20 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 120 head week-on-week. There was a smaller field of buyers with the group back to its usual attendees who were operating in a dearer market. Quality was limited with cows making up the majority of the sale. A couple of trade steers and a few grown steers improved 14c/kg. Heavy beef cows lifted 10c while light conditioned dairy lots kicked 40c/kg. Heavy bulls lifted 12c/kg. 

The trade steers made 384c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold from 340c to 386c/kg. Friesian manufacturing steers made between 264c and 293c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold between 228c and 310c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly from 260c to 340c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 265c to 298c/kg. 

Market reporter: Brendan Fletcher."
