Commentary
"Numbers more than halved for the last sale of the year. It was a smaller field of  buyers with not all operating. Quality was fair to excellent for grain assisted stock. Competition at times over all categories was patchy mostly due to the looming holiday break. Most cattle under 500kg relied on feedlots and restockers for competition. 
 
In the trade sale quality was fair to very good for the limited few. Trade steers with finish fetched 320c to 362c, while the heifer portion made from 310c to 319c/kg.  There was a limited supply of vealers  and they sold  from 260c to 355c/kg . Medium weight feeder steers sold weaker competition making from 308c to 350c/kg.  
 
In the export market  not all buyers operated and competition was mostly dependent on a couple of processors. Heavy steers  average 333c/kg. Bullocks sold to mixed  prices due to fat cover, with the bulk making from 298c to 338c/kg. Good crossbred bullocks made from 273 to 305c/kg. A smaller offering of cows, which sold to a reduced field of buyers and prices slipped back 10c with heavy cows averaging 290c/kg. It was a slightly softer market for leaner grades under 520kg. D3 cows sold from 250c to 272c/kg.  Heavy bulls sold to weak demand with prices slipping 10c to 12c/kg. The bulk of the better shaped heavy bulls made from  275 to 300c/kg.
