Commentary
"There were 1870 cattle offered at Shepparton, of that 1300 export and 570 were trade cattle. The majority of buyers were present. There were fewer bullocks over 600kg liveweight. The trade cattle were of mixed quality, as both supplementary fed finished cattle and store lines were on offer. 

Store buyers were more subdued. Some cattle clearly showing the affects of the drier spring conditions. The yearling steers ranged from 310c to a top of 392c/kg to average 343c/kg. The yearling heifers made from 280c to 385c/kg to av 325c/kg lwt. 

Finished Freisian steers made to 290c/kg. The 500 to 600kg grown steers C3 and C4 made from 300c to 352c/kg, while the 600kg plus bullocks reached 365c/kg. There were fewer cows about and dairy cows ranged from 218c to 280c/kg to average 244c/kg. The beef cattle made from 244c to 310c/kg with the majority selling around 285c/kg."
