Commentary
"There were 1250 exports of which 525 were cows and 720 trade cattle were also penned. It was a very mixed quality lineup, with only a couple of pens of finished grown steers as more crossey steers were present. Feedlotters and opportunistic buyers secured lines of some of the heavier cattle. Prices were again softer across most grades of stock with the exception of some of the better end yearlings and supplementary fed trade cattle. 

The vealers to the trade reached 340c/kg. The yearling steers B and C muscled made from 280c to 364c/kg to average 325c/kg to be 10 to 15c/kg cheaper. The C muscled yearling heifer portion to processors held firm and made from 299c to 365c/kg.  Plainer cattle lost ground and saw cheaper trends and were picked up by local feedlotters. 

The Friesian steers made from 267c to 298c/kg. The 400 to 500kg C muscled steers made from 285c to 335c/kg, the finished 500 to 600kg steers remained at similar rates and  reached 352c/kg, 600kg plus steers made from 294c to 349c/kg to average 335c/kg.

Heavy beef cows made from 260c to 305c/kg which was 7c to 11c/kg down and heavy Friesian cows made from 210c to 278c/kg."
