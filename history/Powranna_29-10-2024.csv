Total Yarding: 91 (-54)
Commentary
"There was a smaller yarding of 91 trade and export cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with quality not as good and as a result prices for trade cattle were slightly cheaper with yearling steers making 302c to 336c and heifers 310c to 330c.
The few grown steers made 322c to 330c and heavy heifers 280c to 328c.

There was a smaller yarding of about 40 cows with very few heavy pens and that market lost most of last weekâ€™s gains to make 278c to 288c, leaner 200c to 270c and very lean 130c to 180c/kg live.
