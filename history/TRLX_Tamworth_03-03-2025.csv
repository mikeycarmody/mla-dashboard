Commentary
"The forecast of a large cyclonic rain event had a marked effect on numbers despite said event not yet eventuating. Those numbers reducing by more than half. The quality of the offering was very mixed and was reflected in price change, particularly in the young cattle. The usual buyers were in attendance however not all regular Queensland processors participated.

In the young cattle market the lightweight steers to restockers were much cheaper with breed and quality accounting for much of the price change. Medium weight steers to restock and feed were also affected by quality and breed with trends firm to slightly cheaper. The heavy weight feeder steers sold on a firm market trend. Good quality medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to feed were well sought after and sold on a firm to slightly dearer trend while the lessor quality heifers remained unchanged.

Heavy grown steers to process were keenly sought and sold to dearer trend. The supply not enough to satisfy demand. The same to be said in the cow market where trends were dearer for all but the plainest light and medium weights. Isolated sales of the better heavy weight cows recovering much of last weeks losses."
