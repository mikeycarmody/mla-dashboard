Commentary
"Charters Towers Combined Agents yarded 1,367 cattle in a prime only sale. Quality was mostly good, however many lines did not have the weight or conditions of previous weeks. Only three regular processors were in attendance and operating along with one live exporter and regular feeder operators. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Croydon, Richmond and the local area.

Demand was firm on better quality lines, however light conditioned pens met limited demand. Yearlings and bullocks  averaged firm to 8c better, while prime cows fell 5c and heavy bulls averaged 12c lower.

Yearling steers above 400kg to feed averaged 244c selling to 246c, yearling heifers above 330kg averaged 214c/kg. A good sample of grown steers to the trade sold to 246c to average 244c/kg.  An increased number of grown heifers to processors reached 226c, most selling from 185c to 210c/kg, while PTE heifers to live export made 170c/kg.

A mixed quality offering of heavy bullocks to export slaughter sold to 240c to average near 220c/kg. Lightweight 2 score cows to processors averaged 137c selling to 155c, medium weight 2 score cows sold to 150c/kg.  A large sample of medium weight cows to processors sold to 186c to average 167c, a small number of prime heavyweight cows topped at an isolated 214c to average 184c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export sold to 260c, with bulls to feed destined for live export averaging 216c to 220c/kg.

A small line of cows and calves sold for $775 per unit.

A store sale scheduled for Friday has 2,600 cattle listed.
