Commentary
"There was a slightly larger yarding of 138 trade and grown cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with few yearlings and more grown steers and heifers. The market was fully firm to 10c dearer with yearling steers making 210c to 248c and heifers 200c to 252c. Grown steers and bullocks made 220c to 260c and heavy heifers 240c to 260c/kg.

There was a very mixed yarding of 60 cows with most being very light conditioned. The best heavy cows made 170c to 194c while the rest made 10c to 110c with really only a couple of bids on each pen.
The few bulls made 132 to 148c/kg liveweight.
