Commentary
"In what was the largest penning in quite some time yearlings and cows were well represented. There was a fair supply of grown steers and heifers along with the first of the early weaners. The quality of the offering was fair to very good while condition varied greatly. The regular buyers were in attendance.

Restocker demand was strong for good quality young cattle with the steer weaners selling particularly well. The heifer portion were also keenly sought. Plain quality yearling steers in all categories were harder to sell and attracted less competition than the better quality lines. Market trends were dearer through all weight classes when compared to pre Christmas levels. Heifer yearlings also attracted strong competition with demand from restocker and feedlot orders strong. Once again the better quality lines were keenly sought while secondary and plain quality heifers were discounted considerably.

A small number of well finished heavy grown steers showed strong improvement as did the well finished grown heifers purchased by processors. Processor demand for cows was very strong with market trends also showing strong gains. Heavy bulls were also dearer."
