Commentary
"There was a few extra cattle yarded this week for a total of 1,094 head, consisting of a good supply of yearlings and a larger penning of cows.  The yarding of young cattle consisted of several runs of well bred and well finished yearling steers and heifers suitable for restockers, backgrounders and feeder buyers.

The few pens of restocker weaner steers sold to a top of 412c, while light restocker and background yearling steers met a strong market selling from 376c to 407c/kg.  Medium weight feeder steers held firm ranging from 376c to 412c, while heavy feeder steers sold to a dearer trend selling from 374c to 424c/kg.  Yearling heifers could not maintain last weeks rates to be 10c easier ranging from 310c to 358c/kg.

There was a limited supply of grown steers, however demand was strong with the steers to process selling from 332c to a top of 360c/kg for the younger steers. Grown heifers held firm selling to 352c/kg.  The yarding of cows consisted of a large percentage of heavy high yielding cows, in a market that was firm to 5c/kg cheaper.
