Commentary
"Supply more than doubled off the low base of a week ago with 1293 cattle yarded. Quality was mixed and one key exporter which had been keen on heavy grown steers at recent sales was absent from the buying group. Agents said the sale had a cheaper trend, mirroring the weaker price results which have been seen across the wider industry this week.  About a third of the yarding of 435 head were cows and these averaged about 10c/kg cheaper with only the very best heavy females able to sell above 300c/kg in this sale. Heavy grown steers and grown heifers were also cheaper, with losses of 10c to 20c/kg evident compared to a week ago. There was still some robust sales in the young store cattle section depending on quality and number in a pen.

Grown steers sold to 368c/kg lwt, with the the better bred and shaped yearling and heavier steers mostly in a range of 320c to 360c/kg. Heavy heifers offering more yield and quality to buyers sold to 348c but there was a lot of sales in the 260-330c/kg range.  Prices for young cattle to restockers, feeders and processors varied from 260c to 340c/kg for the majority depending on type and number in a pen, single animals sometimes discounted.

In the cow run processors were reluctant to bid much over 300c/kg, with the lead of the beef females from 270c to a top of 308c/kg lwt. Plainer store type cows  230c to 263c/kg. The average price across all 435 cows sold was 278c/kg or $1629 per head on an average weight of 584kg, according to saleyard data.
