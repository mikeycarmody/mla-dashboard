Commentary
"Numbers eased by nearly 300 head in very hot conditions for a yarding of 2704 cattle.  Quality was mixed, comprising of fewer prime cows, however some good well finished bullocks were penned, supported by some very good quality store steers and heifers. All regular processors were in attendance and operating, supported by two live exporters, regular feeders and some western restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Croydon, Torrens Ck, Herveyâ€™s Range, local and coastal areas.

Buyer demand was good for the majority penned, with improved overall quality a factor. Price for light steers and heifers improved 18c to 25c, medium feeder steers and heifers slipped 16c/kg. Strong demand for heavy well finished cattle saw values improve by 6c to 25c/kg, secondary lines were firm to 8c easier.

Young steers above 200kg returning to grass averaged 254c to 277c, selling to 286c, similar heifers to grass reached 290c to average 236c/kg. Yearling steers above 200kg to backgrounders sold to 290c, averaging 271c to 286c/kg. Yearling steers to live export above 280kg sold to 310c to average near 277c, while steers above 400kg also made to 310c to average 298c/kg. A small sample of yearling heifers returning to the paddock averaged 247c and heifers above 280kg averaged 263c/kg. Yearling heifers above 280kg to the trade sold to 258c, heifers above 330kg to feed averaged 261c to 266c/kg. Grown steers above 400kg to the trade sold to 318c averaging 294c to 305c, those suitable to live export averaged 271c/kg. Heavy grown steers above 500kg sold to 334c to average 324c/kg.  Grown heifers to the trade made to 264c a good sample averaging 262c, feeder heifers averaged 258c to 274c/kg.

Heavy full mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 334c to average 314c to 328c/kg. A reduced supply of cows sold to firm demand.  Lightweight cows to processors made to 238c to average 216c, medium weight 3 scores topped at 282c to average 261c/kg. Medium and heavy weight bulls to live export sold to 306c to average 278c to 299c/kg. Heavy bulls to processors reached 306c, averaging 285c to 300c/kg.

A good supply of cows and calves sold to strong demand topping at $1,275 per unit.
