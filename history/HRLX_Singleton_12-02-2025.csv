Commentary
"Wild weather and heavy downpours yesterday of around 25mm contributed to a decline in numbers as Singleton agents yarded 512 cattle. With warm weather and country responding quickly from recent rain, local opportunistic re-stockers stepped into the market along with most of the regular buyers which saw fluctuating results throughout the grades.
 
Light weaner steers jumped 43c/kg trading from 304c to 434c/kg, medium weights dearer by 19c/kg selling from 342c to 436c/kg. Over 330kg to the lot feeders improved 35c/kg making from 372c to 382c/kg. Light weaner heifers reversed this trend to be 18c/kg cheaper trading between 238c and 328c/kg averaging around 288c/kg. Prime Butcher calves over 330kg saw a spike of 28c/kg making between 320c and 366c/kg.
 
Most of the yearling steers presented lacked quality and had popped their two teeth and struggled to maintain last weeks rates for the medium weights making from 280c to 344c/kg, conversely over 400kg destined for the grain bin were dearer by 14c/kg selling between 340c and 358c/kg. A similar story for yearling heifers with medium weights topping at 308c/kg to the re-stockers and 338c/kg to the butchers. Over 400kg averaged 330c/kg to the lot feeders.
 
Only a handful of cows on offer light 2 scores selling from 248c to 268c/kg, heavy prime cows were 3c/kg off the pace trading from 276c to 288c/kg.
