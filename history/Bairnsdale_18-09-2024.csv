Commentary
"There were approximately 170 export and 20 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 40 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present but not all operating fully in a cheaper market in places. Quality was very limited with cows making up the majority of the sale. A handful of trade cattle sold to firm demand. The sprinkling of grown eased a little. Heavy beef cows eased 5c to 15c while light conditioned cows gave back 25c to 45c/kg. Heavy bulls sold firm. 

Vealers sold from 307c to 388c/kg. A couple of yearling heifers suited to the trade made 340c/kg. A pen of bullocks sold for 352c/kg. Manufacturing steers sold up to 341c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold between 191c and 245c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly from 244c to 340c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 294c to 336c after a top of 373c/kg.
