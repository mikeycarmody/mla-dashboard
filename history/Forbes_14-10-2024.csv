Commentary
"Numbers lifted by 372 for a yarding of 1802 cattle. Quality was good with an excellent yarding of prime yearlings and grown cattle. There was limited supply of feeder types on offer as well as a small supply of cows. All the regular buyers were present.

Prime yearling steers were slightly cheaper, 265c to 360c, while prime yearling heifers gained 4c, 281c to 345c/kg. Feeder steers were considerably cheaper, 302c to 365c, and feeder heifers eased 5c, 270c to 325c/kg.

Prime grown cattle were up to 15c better in places, heavy steers sold from 284c to 358c, and heavy heifers, 265c to 344c/kg. Cows dropped 15c, 2 and 3 scores sold from 180c to 280c, and heavy prime cows, 285c to 318c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 296c/kg.
