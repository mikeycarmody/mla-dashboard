Commentary
"The numbers remained steady with cows well supplied including a herd dispersal of mixed age cows in plainer condition. There was a good supply of young cattle while well finished grown cattle apart from cows and bulls to suit processors were in limited supply. There was extra feedlot competition while the full compliment of processors were in attendance.

Restocker and feedlot demand was strong through the young cattle with weaners returning to the paddock selling to significantly dearer trends. Availability reduced following a run of big weaner sales. The increased competition impacted medium and heavy weight yearlings positively with the market trend for steers substantially dearer. The heifer portion also sold to dearer trends however the improvement was not as great.

Strong demand from both restockers and processors was strong for cows. The dispersal cows having run continuously with bulls. They sold to a slightly dearer trend. With the number of cows in the system reducing competition from processors was strong on the well finished lots. They sold to a dearer trend of as much as 13c/kg. Heavy bulls were also keenly sort after to show a significantly dearer trend."
