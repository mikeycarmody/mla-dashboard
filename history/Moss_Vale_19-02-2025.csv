Commentary
"High yielding yearling steers reaching 457c, and cows up to 30c/kg dearer, were the highlights of the 1900 mostly good quality cattle, an increase of 1140. There were some good pens of feeder steers, along with some good runs of yearling heifers and some outstanding lines of weaner heifers..There was an increased number of grown cattle and 375 cows. All the usual buyers, with the return of a Southern buyer, resulted in another strong market.

Yearlings to suit the trade lifted 5c, selling from 295c to 457c/kg. Feeder steers were also 5c better, making from 295c to 370c,/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed were up to 8c dearer, averaging 324c, and those returning to the paddock reached 352c/kg. Lightweight weaners suiting the restockers continue to attract strong competition, with the steers ranging from 295c to 480c, and the heifers ranged from 242c to 418c/kg.

Heavy grown cattle were firm to a few cents dearer, with the steers selling from 295c to 350c, and the heifers made from 282c to 330c/kg. Cows were up to 30c dearer, with the 3 scores reaching 315c, and heavy 4 scores made from 298c to 334c/kg. Heavy bulls to process lifted 4c, topping at 316c/kg.
