Commentary
"Numbers lifted by 962 on the last reported sale a fortnight ago to 2727 cattle. Quality was mixed throughout, comprising of several small lines of well finished heavy bullocks and cows, a very good line of feeder steers, supported by a large number of lightweight wearers. The buyer panel increased with additional processor attendance, along with regular feeders, opportunity backgrounders and restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Croydon, McKinlay to Pentland, local and coastal areas.

Increased processor demand resulted in further improved averages for suitable feeder and processor categories with grown steers to processors lifting 20c to 25c, heavy cows improved by 5c to 13c, bullocks rose 40c and heavy bulls were mostly firm. Good quality young cattle sold to an enthusiastic panel of buyers, however lesser quality lightweight lines met limited demand. 

A good selection of suitably weaned.light steers returning to grass averaged 264c selling to 286c, best quality steers above 200kg averaged 278c/kg. Similar restocker heifers sold to 247c to average 244c, processor heifers averaged 230c/kg. Mixed quality yearling steers above 200kg made to 266c to average 251c, while a good supply of heavier steers above 330kg to feed sold stronger, reaching 320c to average 299c/kg. Several small lines of yearling heifers sold according to quality with trade types making to 278c to average 275c, best feeder heifers above 330kg selling to 267c to average 261c/kg. 

Grown steers above 400kg to feed made to 326c to average 321c/kg. Grown steers above 400kg to the trade reached 318c to average 293c, heavy steers above 500kg sold to 324c to average 321c/kg. Good quality heavy grown heifers to the trade sold to 302c to average 286c/kg.

A good sample of heavy bullocks to export slaughter topped at 338c, averaging 324c to 331c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows made to 258c to average 248c, 3 scores reached 284c to average from 258c to 268c and prime heavyweight 3 and 4 score cows topped at 286c to average 272c to 281c/kg. Heavy bulls to processors sold to 268c to average 260c/kg.
