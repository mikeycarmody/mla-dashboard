Commentary
"Despite more rain there was only a small reduction in numbers. Young cattle were well supplied along with cows while well finished grown cattle were scarce. The quality of the offering was very mixed and this impacted price change. The usual buyers were in attendance.

The strong demand of recent weeks from restockers for light weight steers was not as evident with market trends being cheaper. The mixed quality impacting price change significantly. Medium weights to restock and feed experienced little but quality related price change. There were very few straight lines in the heavy weight feeders, they sold to a cheaper trend with some quality and breed related price change either way. Lightweight yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend with breed contributing. Restockers seeing a price benefit in comparison to purchasing steers. There were odd dearer sales in an otherwise firm market trend for the medium and heavy weight heifers to feed. Well finished trade yearlings sold to cheaper trends with not as much competition from feedlotters.

There were too few heavy grown steers suitable to processors to quote. Demand for well finished grown heifers was strong with market trends dearer. The cow market failed to reach the heights of last week resulting in cheaper trends, quality change resulting in some positive price change in odd classes."
