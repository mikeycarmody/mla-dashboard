Commentary
"Dryer and milder conditions allowed Singleton agents to pen 809 cattle up 300 head on last week. Increased supplies of supplementary fed weaners and yearlings along with a good selection of re-stocker weaners, some handy yearlings to suit the lot feeders and around 60 cows were offered. The market was able to regain its footing with most classes of cattle finding extra buyer support.
 
Light steer weaners saw a spike of 22c/kg and sold from 314c to 476c/kg averaging 412c/kg, medium weights saw even bigger gains making from 330c to 452c/kg. Not to be outdone weaner heifers saw comparable gains trading between 270c and 326c/kg, medium weights made up to 356c/kg for B muscles.
 
Medium and heavy yearling steers lacked any great lines and struggled to garner any “over and above” support mostly going to the lot feeding ranks to be slightly cheaper selling from 308c to 350c/kg. Some big pen-fulls of grain assisted yearling heifers snapped up by the local trade making up to 354c/kg and averaging 326c/kg
 
Light 2 score cows were slightly cheaper making from 230c to 276c/kg, heavy prime cows 11c to 19c/kg better off trading between 286c and 305c/kg.
