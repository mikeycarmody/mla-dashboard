Commentary
"Numbers fell by 1276 for a yarding of 1971 cattle.  The supply of prime cattle fell by half in a very mixed quality yarding. All regular processors were in attendance and operating, however feeder and restockers attendance was subdued.  Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Ingham and south tho the Burdekin and local area.

Most categories struggled to maintain values of the previous week, particularly in the store section.  Good quality lines met firm competition, however secondary and plainer conditioned types attracted minimal buyer support with some individual animals failing to sell. Grown steers and heifers to processors eased 4c to 30c, bullocks fell 20c to 25c, medium cows averaged 7c to 10c lower and heavy bulls sold 40c to 55c lower.

Young, weaned cross bred steers to restockers topped at 334c, a good sample averaging 313c, with similar heifers returning to the paddock reaching 260c to average 231c/kg. Light yearling steers to restockers made to 266c to average 248c and steers above 280kg to the paddock sold to and averaged 230c/kg. Yearling steers above 330 kg to feed sold to 250c and steers above 400kg made 247c/kg. Light yearling heifers to restockers reached 200c to average 149c/kg. Very good quality heifers above 280kg for breeding topped at 242c to average 229c/kg.

Grown steers above 400kg to feed averaged 231c selling to 250c with similar trade types averaging 221c to 229c /kg. Heavy grown steers to processors reached 246c to average 241c/kg. Good quality grown heifers to the trade sold to 258c to average from 226c to 249c/kg.  PTiC heifers made 244c/kg.

Heavy bullocks to export slaughter topped at 258c to average 245c to 250c/kg. Medium weight three score cows sold to 240c to average from 219c to 236c and a good selection of prime heavyweight cows topped at 245c to average 240c to 243c/kg.  Heavy bulls to processors reached 230c to average 216c and bulls to feed destined for live export made to 240c, most averaging 195c to 218c/kg.
