Commentary
"Following a few very rough days there was a very small yarding of cattle at Powranna on Tuesday and quality was mixed. All cattle sold to a similar market with yearling steers making 300c to 354c and heifers 298c to 328c. The few grown steers and bullocks made 312c to 344c.

The best pen of cows made 312c while very lean made 204c to 248c/kg and were bought by restockers.
