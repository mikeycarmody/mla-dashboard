Commentary
"There was a larger yarding of 203 trade and export cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with about half being cows. The quality of yearlings was mixed and prices eased 20c to 30c with steers making 162c to 220c and heifers 166c to 212c/kg.
The few grown steers made 190c to 224c/kg.

Good quality beef cows sold to a similar market while leaner and light cows were hard to sell being 50c to 70c/kg cheaper. Heavy cows made 140c to 180c, leaner 120c to 135c and very lean 20c to 70c. Heavy bulls made 130c to 140c/kg liveweight.
