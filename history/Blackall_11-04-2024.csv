Saleyard: Blackall
Report Date: 11/04/2024
Comparison Date: 04/04/2024
Total Yarding: 1780 (-3820)
Commentary
"A total of 1,780 head were yarded for the weekly Blackall prime and store sale. The yarding was dominated by local prime steers, cows and grown heifers alongside a mixed quality yarding of yearlings. All the usual buyers were present and active however competition could not maintain the prices of the previous week for prime cattle, and a reduction in quality saw yearlings also lose ground.

Light weight yearling steers saw a top of 346.2c to average 335c, yearling steers 280 to 330kg sold to 330.2c to average 320c and small supply of heavy yearling steers to feed sold to 320.2c to average 310c/kg. 

Heavy heifers to feed made to 263.2c to average 252c while those to the processor sold to 262.2c averaging 240c/kg.

Heavy grown steers over 500kg sold to 285.2c to average 278c, Medium cows 400 to 520kg sold to 225.2c to average 210c and good heavy cows over 520kg sold to 238.2c to average 218c/kg.
