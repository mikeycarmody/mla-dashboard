Commentary
"Numbers halved for a yarding of 676 head, consisting mainly of weaner and yearling cattle and there was a good supply of cowâ€™s.   Quality was very mixed although there was several pens of well bred young cattle through the sale.  

The market saw well bred cattle sell firm to a dealer trend, however plainer type cattle were easier.  Restocker weaner steers sold from 250c to 398c, while restocker weaner heifers ranged from 222c to 266c/kg.  Feeder steers sold according to quality ranging from 284c to 376c, while feeder heifers sold from 312c to 328c/kg.

There was only a few grown steers offered toping at 256c and grown heifers sold to 268c/kg.  Heavy cows were 5c dearer selling from 188c to 220c/kg.  There was a large number of plain cows penned, most went to restockers selling from 124c to 182c/kg.
