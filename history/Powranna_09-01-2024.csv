Commentary
"There was a very small yarding of 40 cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with most being yearlings. There was limited interest with most being bought by restockers with yearling steers making 200c to 254c and heifers 190c to 240c/kg liveweight.
There werenâ€™t enough grown cattle to quote.

Market Reporter Richard Bailey"
