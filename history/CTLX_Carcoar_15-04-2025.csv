"With the good falls of snow and up to 60mm of rain over the weekend numbers were back falling by 430 head. It was a good quality yarding with good numbers of prime cattle in all sections. There were also fair numbers of cattle to suit the backgrounders and restockers wanting cattle to go on crops. A normal field of buyers were operating in a strong market.

Young cattle to the trade were 5c to 8c dearer with vealers selling to 424c/kg. Prime steer yearlings sold to 419c while the prime heifer yearlings sold from 398c to 429c/kg.

"With the good falls of rain and snow over the weekend numbers were back by 1135 head. It was a good quality yarding, with good numbers of young cattle in prime condition along with odd pens of well finished grown steers and heifers. There were very few feeders yarded with the bulk of the young cattle going to the restockers to go on crop or the processors. There were also some good runs of well finished cows yarded. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance and operating.

Young cattle to the trade were firm to 3c cheaper, with the prime steer yearlings selling from 380c to 420c, while the prime heifer yearlings sold from 370c to 415c/kg. Limited numbers of feeder steers were firm selling from 370c to 402c/kg.

"With the following sale date cancelled due to the holiday weekend numbers increased for a generally fair to good quality offering of cattle. The yearling heifers were well supplied, while fair numbers of grown steers and cows were yarded.

The yearling steers improved 3c to 6c as those selling to the lot feeders ranged from 162c to 186c as those to trade buyers reached 187c/kg. The large percentages of yearling heifers caused values to ease 6c to 10c with lot feeders paying from 150c to 165c/kg for the selection of medium weights. The heavier drafts selling to lot feeders and the trade lost 2c/kg in value.

Grown steers remained around the same in value as heavyweights to slaughter ranged from 146c to 166c/kg. Heifers on average lost 4c/kg, however the better end remained around firm in value.

Cows continue to improve in value to remain firm to 4c/kg dearer. The plainer D2 pens averaged 113c as the better finished D3 and D4 cows ranged from 115c to 127c/kg. Heavy bulls lost quality and prices remained stable as the best reached 135c/kg."
"With the dry conditions continuing, it was a larger and very mixed quality yarding. There were more secondary young cattle in 1 and 2 score condition although there was still a good selection of prime yearlings suitable for processors. Vealers were limited but the cows and grown steers showed plenty of weight and condition. 

Most of the regular buyers attended operated in a cheaper market. Young cattle slipped 10c to 15c/kg, with very little restocker interest. Vealer steers to all orders made from 160c to 196c/kg. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed ranged from 155c to 191c to average around 170c/kg. Those to the trade made from 165c to 187c/kg. Heifers met selective bidding with quality critical. Those to feed made from 135c to 160c, while processor lots ranged from 140c to 170c/kg. The plainer D muscled heifers made from 110c to 130c/kg. 

Grown steers averaged around 6c/kg cheaper in spite of the return of a northern operator and a very good run of two tooth lots. The C muscled grown steers and bullocks ranged from 165c to 197c/kg. The best of the grown heifers made from 140c to 165c/kg. Cows eased 5c to 10c, with D2s from 120c to 128c, while 3 and 4 scores ranged from 122c to 150c, with most from 135c to 140c/kg."
"With some regions of the supply area receiving rainfall over the weekend, numbers slipped and quality was also plainer with some lines of cattle starting to show the affects of the colder weather. Fair numbers of vealers together with a good run of yearlings were offered with the majority selling to lot feeder orders. The grown steers were mainly suitable for further finish with few prime pens suitable for slaughter yarded. The cow quality slipped with the majority lower yielding than those yarded at the previous market.

The medium weighted vealer steers returning to the paddock lost value, as breed and quality also slipped compared to the previous market. Vealer heifers slipped 3c to 4c/kg in value. Light and medium weight yearling steers to lot feeders lost 3c to 5c/kg, while the heavy weights also selling to the feeders remained firm. The yearling steers selling to trade orders also showed little change in value. Light and medium weight yearling heifers to lot feeders lifted 3c to 6c/kg, as those selling to the trade remained firm.

Grown steers to lot feeders lost 2c, while the few heavy steers and bullocks to slaughter ranged from 162c to 180c/kg. The heifer portion struggled to remain firm with quality slipping compared to the last market. The lower yielding penning of cows generally lost 2c to 3c as the plainer D2 pens averaged 124c, while the medium and heavy weight D3 and D4 lots ranged from 123c to 140c/kg. The heavy bulls lost 3c as the best reached 167.6c/kg."
"With some parts of the supply area starting to receive light rainfall numbers eased for a generally better quality offering of cattle. There were fair numbers of vealers together with a good yarding of yearling steers with most going to lot feeder orders. The yearling heifers were reduced in number as were the heavy grown steers, while a fair yarding of cows was offered. The market trend was dearer with the usual buyer all competing at the rail.

Vealer steers returning to the paddock gained 2c to range from 151c to 192c, while the best heavyweights selling to trade orders reached 205c/kg. The heifer portion remained firm with only quality issues affecting values in some places. The yearling steers improved 4c to 6c as light and medium weights to lot feeders and restockers ranged from 161c to 189c, as the better muscled drafts sold to the trade reached 204c/kg. The few yearling heifers suitable for lot feeders struggled in the competition, while those suitable for trade orders gained 5c/kg in value.

The limited supply of grown steers to slaughter improved 4c/kg, while the heifer portion showed similar gains in value. Cows lifted 4c to 6c as the plain D2 pens averaged 115c, while the better finished D3 and D4 drafts ranged from 114c to 134c/kg. Heavy bulls sold at similar rates as the best reached 145.6c/kg."
"With producers showing greater confidence in the seasonal conditions, numbers more than halved and quality remained mixed. There were good runs of younger cattle, as grown steers and heifers were limited in supply. Cows were again well represented percentage wise, with around 750 penned. The usual buying orders competed in a dearer market.

Heavy weight bulls remained firm, as the best topped at 162c/kg."
"With no sale next week due to the Australia Day break numbers lifted by a little more than 1,000. It was a good quality yarding with good numbers of yearlings to suit both the feeder and processors with the feeders buying the bulk. There was some good lots of grown steers and heifers and there were 370 cows yarded. A full field of buyers competed strongly along with the return of a northern feeder operator and a major supermarket buyer.

Young cattle to the trade were 15c dearer with prime vealers selling to 442c/kg. Prime steer yearlings sold from 380c to 446c while the heifer yearlings sold from 380c to 444c/kg.

"With more than 150mm of rain over the past week numbers were back by 170 head. It was a good quality yarding with the usual good runs of ideal feeder cattle along with good numbers to suit the trade buyers. Grown steers and heifers were in limited supply, and there were 150 cows penned. Not all the usual buyers were present with the absence of a major southern domestic processor.

Young cattle to the trade were up to 15c cheaper, with prime vealers selling to 540c/kg. Prime steer yearlings sold from 460c to 510c, while the prime heifer yearlings sold from 420c to 555c/kg.

"With large portions of the supply area receiving substantial rainfall consignments eased and quality was fair to good. Vealers were scarce as fair runs of yearlings were penned. Grown steers and bullocks were limited in supply as around 550 generally good yielding cows were offered. The usual orders competed in a dearer market.

The best of the well-muscled vealers to the butchers reached 214.2c as the majority sold around the 194c/kg. Medium weight yearling steers to lot feeder orders gained 8c as the heavier pens lifted 5c/kg. The yearling heifers remained firm to 2c/kg dearer to lot feeder sales as heavy weights to the butchers sold at similar prices compared to the last market.

Bulls continue to sell well as the best heavy weight reached 178c/kg."
"With all the wet conditions numbers fell by 390 for a yarding of 483. It was a good quality yarding with a good selection of exceptional vealers and yearlings to suit the processors along with odd lots to suit the feeders and restockers. There were limited numbers of grown steers and heifers and there were 71 cows yarded.
 
Young cattle to the trade were 15c dearer with prime vealers selling to 566c/kg. Prime steer yearlings sold from 460c to 570c, while the prime heifer yearlings sold from 500c to 569c/kg.

"With a short week numbers halved and the quality of the young cattle was good. There was a good number of weaners and well breed feeders. Grown steers were again limited and the quality of the cows was back, with most of the cows light and medium weights. The market sold to a firm to dearer trend.

Weaner steers were dearer, with restockers paying from 240c to 280c for the steers and up to 210c/kg for heifers. Heavy butcher vealers received from 256c to 279c/kg.

Medium weight 2 score cows received from 180c to 210c and the heavy weights made from 205c to 216c, averaging 212c/kg lwt."
"Widespread rain and a store sale last week and this week, has contributed to a significant decrease in numbers for a total yarding of 987, fair to good quality cattle. There was some excellent lines of grain assisted European yearlings to process, along with some good runs to suit the feedlot buyers. There were a few pens of well-bred vealers, a limited supply of grown cattle and 256 cows. All the usual buyers were operating, selling to a mostly dearer  trend.

Prime vealers reached 436c/kg. Yearling steers to suit the trade, reached 429c, to average 334c/kg. Yearling heifers to process were 10c better, selling from 270c to 424c/kg.

"Wet and cold conditions reduced numbers but the quality was good. Yearlings were well supplied along with some large drafts of grown steers and bullocks. Nearly 280 cows were also penned for the usual buying group in a dearer market.

Restocking vealer steers gained 20c/kg as did the light weaner heifers. Heifers ranged from 270c to 296c/kg. Yearling feeder steers gained 3c for the medium weights and the heavy feeders attracted strong competition and gained 15c/kg on average. Prices ranged from 260c to 324c/kg.

"Up to 200mm of rain in some of the drawing area and following the previous sales much cheaper market numbers were back by 1100. There were a few lots of good quality yearlings to suit the feeders and only a couple of head to suit the processors. There were 60 mixed grown steers and heifers yarded along with 165 cows. Not all the regular buyers were operating due to the small number. 

A couple of prime steer yearlings sold to trade buyers for 480c and 526c/kg. Feeder steers and heifers regained a little of the previous sales falls lifting by around 10c/kg.

"There were stronger markets over the past week at all major markets where numbers increased. It was a good quality yarding with a good selection of trade cattle and ideal feeders throughout. Cows were well supplied and there were only limited numbers of grown steers and heifers.

"There were some excellent lines of heavy weight cows and grown steers and heifers though the young cattle quality was only fair. Not all the regular buyers were operating in a variable market.

Limited numbers of young cattle to the trade were dearer for the vealers and cheaper for the yearlings. Vealers sold to 385c while the prime steer yearlings sold from 308c to 370c/kg. Prime heifer yearlings sold to 356c/kg. Young feeder cattle were 6c to 10c/kg dearer compared to the previous sales cheaper market.

Heavy bulls sold to 270c/kg."
"There were fewer cattle penned and quality was mixed with vealers scarce in the market. Good runs of yearlings together with greater percentages of heavy weight grown steers and bullocks were yarded. Around 350 cows were offered and on average the market sold at marginally cheaper levels.

The best of the heavy weight vealers to the butchers reached 222c/kg. Medium weight yearling steers to feeder orders lost 5c to sell from 160c to 194c, depending on quality and breed, as heavy weights slipped from 1c to 7c/kg. The same weight heifer portion to the same orders lifted 5c as the popular breeds reached 181c/kg. Yearlings to trade and butcher orders remained unchanged compared to the last market.

Heavy weight grown steers and bullocks to slaughter sold firm to 3c/kg cheaper, however age contributed in places. The heifer portion lost 2c/kg. Cows continued the cheaper trend to slip back from 2c to 5c/kg. The plainer 2 scores averaged 112c as the better finished 3 and 4 scores ranged from 124c to 135c/kg. The best well-muscled heavy weight bull topped at 175c/kg."
"There was only a small decrease in the numbers offered and the quality was mixed, with a good supply of fresh vealers. Yearlings were also well supplied, with a large percentage going to feeders. Grown steers were plainer, with an increased number of lighter weights and around 350 cows were offered to a slightly smaller buying field.

Vealers to the trade were the exception to the cheaper trend, selling from 8c to 10c dearer, ranging from 220c to 249c/kg. Restocking lines ranged from 200c to 255c/kg. Yearlings eased 10c to 12c over nearly all categories, with medium weight feeder steers 205c to 244c, whilst the heifer portion averaged 210c/kg. Trade steers sold from 195c to 220c for the heavy lines and the heifers reached 230c/kg for medium weights.

Heavy grown steers averaged 205c and the heavier bullocks ranged from 185c to 207c/kg. Cows eased 3c to 8c, with the 3 and 4 scores 150c to 170c and restocking lines 154c to 157c/kg for the 2 scores."
"There was only a slight increase in numbers and the quality remained good. There were plenty of cattle in prime condition in all weight grades. Yearlings made up a large portion of the offering. Trade buyers were selective on all lines and prices for over conditioned cattle to lot feeders were subdued. Grown steers and bullocks were in reduced numbers and around 700 cows were penned. All the usual buyers operated in a mainly cheaper market.

Vealers were limited and the steer portion to trade buyers ranged from 165c to 201c/kg. Restocking vealer heifers reached 225c/kg. Trade yearlings were back 7c, with steers selling from 163c to 204c and heifers from 150c to 183c/kg. Feeder steers fell 15c to 22c, to range between 160c and 205c, averaging 180c/kg.

Grown steers and bullocks were firm to 2c lower, selling mostly from 168c to 177c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows went against the cheaper trend, lifting up to 20c/kg.

"There was only a slight decrease in numbers and the quality was only fair, with the bulk of the young cattle lacking finish. There were a few prime cattle in all categories. Grown steers and bullocks remained in short supply and there were nearly 500 cows penned. All the usual buyers were operating in a market where trade cattle and feeder steers were similar in value, while feeder heifers, grown steers and cows were dearer than the last sale a fortnight ago.

The best of the vealers to the trade reached 315c and light steers to restockers reached 390c/kg. Medium and heavy feeder steers sold between 280c and 339c/kg. The heifers averaged 7c dearer, to range from 270c to 320c/kg. The trade yearlings were unchanged, with the steers selling from 281c to 326c and heifers 260c to 310c/kg. 

Grown steers and bullocks gained 5c, with most making 275c to 288c/kg. Light 2 score cows sold to a dearer trend, making 195c to 223c, and the heavy 3 and 4 score cows were 6c to 10c dearer, topping at 235c and averaging 230c/kg."
"There was only a slight change in the numbers. Quality was mixed with only a limited supply of good milk vealers. Yearlings were very well supplied and the feeder and restocking orders purchased most of the varying quality. Around 200 grown steers and bullocks were also offered with most in good condition and there was a larger run of mixed quality cows.

Heavy vealers were in short supply and sold dearer with the steers reaching 234c and the heifers 227c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers gained 2c/kg and the heavy weights remained firm. Prices ranged from 174c to 219c/kg. Trade steers were firm for the medium weights but heavy weights eased due to plainer quality. Trade yearling heifers were firm to 2c cheaper ranging from 175c to 216c/kg. Those going onto feed lifted 2c to 5c/kg.

Grown steers and bullocks were 1c to 5c dearer with the best reaching 196c for 2 or more teeth. Cows were also stronger for the heavy weights gaining 1c to 4c/kg. Heavy 3 and 4 score cows ranged from 142c to 174c/kg."
"There was little change in numbers week-on-week, as quality remained mixed, with most weights and grades represented. There were good runs of the younger drafts, as heavy weight grown steers suitable for slaughter were well supplied. Cows were well represented and the usual buyers competed in a firm to dearer market.

Heavy weight vealers to the butchers remained firm to 8c dearer, as the steer and heifer portion ranged from 180c to 225c/kg. Yearling steers to the lot feeders gained 5c, with the pens weighing over 400kg averaging 201c to 205c, after topping at 211c/kg. The prime conditioned heavy weights to the butchers lifted 4c to range from 185c to 210c/kg. Yearling heifers showed little change in price, as the well covered heavy weights averaged 186c and the best reached 208c/kg.

Heavy weight grown steers and bullocks remained firm, as prices sold according to age and finish. Prices were from 178c to 211c/kg. The heifer portion lifted 6c, selling from 166c to 188c/kg. Cows again sold to strong southern processor competition, however the plainer pens struggled to remain firm. The better covered heavier weights remained firm to 3c dearer, and ranged from 126c to 158c/kg. Heavy weight bulls also remained firm and reached 195c/kg."
"There was an increase in the numbers offered. Yearlings made up most of the sale but there were still plenty of quality grown steers and bullocks available. Cows were showing plenty of cover and there was strong competition over all grades, as all but 1 or 2 regular buyers have returned to the dearer market.

Vealers were limited but sold 9c to 13c dearer ranging from 195c to 233c/kg. Lightweight yearlings to feeders gained as much as 20c while medium and heavyweights were 6c to 7c stronger selling between 185c and 222c/kg. Trade steers were 2c to 5c dearer ranging from 185c to 216c, and the heifer portion had gains of 10c to 13c ranging between 181c and 217c/kg.

With a full field of export buyers grown steers and bullocks lifted by 10c to 13c, as sales ranged from 184c to 196c to average 190c/kg. Cows were 6c to 14c better with 2 score cows 135c to 145c, and heavy 3 and 4 scores pens made to 149c/kg. The best C muscle drafts reached 171c/kg."
"There was an increase in cattle numbers to 1,413 at CTLX. Quality was from average to very good with an overall improved yarding as the cattle offered showed more condition and weight. The regular buying group attended with demand at times fluctuating in places throughout the market. Cow prices were from unchanged to slightly easier, grown steers sold from 5c to 15c stronger and there was less demand for feeder steers and heifers as they sold from 10c to 20c/kg cheaper. Young cattle suiting restockers remained close to firm.  Grown heifers and prime younger cattle suiting the processors were from firm to 5c/kg dearer. 

Vealers going back to the paddock made from 549c up to 740c/kg. Prime yearling heifers sold from 480c to 543c as the feeder heifers made from 440c to 517c/kg. Yearling steers to the trade sold from 480c to 544c and the feeders paid mostly from  488c to 556c/kg for their suitable steers. Restockers were also busy as they purchased yearling steers from 500c to 678c with lighter steers also for feeders making from 536c to 609c/kg.

The grown heifers sold from 432 to 496c with the restockers and feeders active paying from 330c to 465c/kg. Grown steers sold from 458c up to 525c and the feeders paid from 495c to 518c/kg. Heavy beef cows made from 382c to 420c with the leaner cows selling from 330c to 375c/kg. Best of the heavy beef bulls sold from 338c to 355c as they sold from firm to 10c/kg dearer.

Market Reporter Tim Delany"
"There was a smaller yarding with the Easter break a factor. Quality overall was mixed from well presented prime cattle to some lacking finish. The market was dominated by younger cattle suiting feeders and a few lots for the processors. The regular buyers attended and operated in a market that did fluctuate at times depending on quality and demand. Bidding was spirited as the younger cattle sold from firm to 10c/kg dearer with some isolated sales stronger during the sale. Grown steers and grown heifers were slightly dearer, cows of medium weight sold firm to 2c dearer with some of the heavy cows from 10c up to 20c/kg higher at times.The 6 bulls penned  sold to firm. The sale consisted of approximately 6 bull,88 cows, 175 heifers and 407 steers. 

Vealers steers sold from 550c to 610c with vealer heifers to 580c/kg. Yearling steers to the trade made from 520c to 560c and the feeders paid from 480c up to 625c/kg. Yearling  trade weight heifers made from 445c to 522c and the feeders were again busy paying from 420c to 570c/kg. Grown steers sold from 395c to 495c and feeders paid to 520c/kg. Good quality grown heifers made from 420c to 451c/kg.

Heavy beef cows sold from 340c to 389c, medium weight cows D2 to D3 scores made from 290c to 332c as restockers purchased cows from mostly 330c 
up to 450c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 300c to 341c/kg.

MLA REPORTER TIM DELANY."
"There was a small increase in numbers. Young cattle were well supplied, along with cows. There were a few well finished heavy grown steers and heifers. The overall quality of the offering was good, with a limited supply of secondary quality cattle penned. The condition varied with well finished cattle in good numbers. There was a good supply to suit restockers and feedlotters. The usual feedlot orders were present, however there was reduced processor competition, particularly on the better cows.

Demand was strong through the young cattle which resulted in firm to dearer trends. Light weight yearling steers to restockers experienced small but quality related price changes. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers sold to a dearer trend. Heavy trade steers saw quality related price changes on a cheaper market trend. Yearling heifers to feed saw a mostly firm market trend, with breed and quality variations resulting in a large price range. The secondary quality yearling heifers saw poor interest from buyers.

Well finished heavy grown steers to processors sold on a firm to dearer market trend with some quality related price change. The well finished grown heifers followed a similar trend. The reduced competition and weaker demand saw the cow market decline. Well finished heavy weights eased up to 15c/kg. There were some higher yielding 2 score cows penned that attracted premiums in line with the increased yield potential."
"There was a small increase in numbers with yearlings making up the bulk of a mixed quality offering. There were limited numbers of heavy steers and cow numbers fell below 90. There were insufficient milk vealers to quote.

The young cattle market was solid with demand from both the trade and finishers strong. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold to a dearer trend, with light and medium weights improving by 3c to 8c/kg. There was little movement in the heavyweight feeder steers. Trade yearling steers sold mostly firm with an isolated sale slightly dearer. Yearling heifers to feeders sold to a dearer trend, up 4c/kg. Trade yearling heifers followed the same trend as the steers.

Heavyweight grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, compared to the previous sale. Grown heifers sold firm for the better quality lots, while the plain grades were a little cheaper. The cow market remained firm while the best cows dropped a little in quality.  Heavyweight bulls also saw a drop in quality with prices reflecting this."
"There was a slight rise in numbers but the quality varied. Prime trade cattle were limited as were the grown steers and bullocks. Feeder orders were active on plainer lines as well as better covered cattle. Weaner heifers were better supplied, along with a reasonable number of cows. Not all the usual buyers attended the market. Most young cattle sold to similar rates while the cows were cheaper and there were too few grown steers to quote.

Veal to the trade ranged from 270c to 337c/kg. Yearling trade steers and heifers were firm on the medium weights and slightly cheaper on heavy weights. Fewer heavy weights were purchased by the trade as feedlot orders were after numbers. Trade steers sold from 310c to 335c and the heifers returned 305c to 330c/kg. Feeder steers were unchanged, selling between 314c to 344c and heifers averaged 2c stronger at 310c/kg.

The few grown steers and bullocks weighing over 500kg made from 287c to 318c/kg. Heavy grown heifers received 247c to 277c, with medium weight 2 tooths reaching 299.6c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows showed little change, ranging from 180c to 239c but the better covered 3 and 4 score heavy weights eased 8c to 18c to sell from 233c to 274c/kg."
"There was a slight reduction in numbers and the quality remained fair to good. Most of the young cattle suited the feeder orders and trade yearlings were limited. Grown steers and bullocks were back in numbers mostly in the heavy bullock runs and just over 300 cows were offered to a slightly smaller export buying group while all the trade and feeder orders were active. 

The best of the restocking vealer steers reached 395c and trade vealers sold to 361c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers and heifers were 2c to 3c cheaper but the better covered and heavier weights were 6c to 10c/kg dearer. Steers ranged from 307c to 363c and heifers 314c to 340c/kg. The limited number of trade steers were 8c dearer on the heavy weights selling from 285c to 328c/kg. Demand eased for trade heifers and they fell 20c selling from 285c to 307c/kg.

Grown steers and bullocks were 8c cheaper receiving 285c to 315c and grown heifers averaged 270c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows sold 2c/kg dearer on average but some lines were well above that. Prices ranged from 210c to 242c/kg. Heavy cows were firm 231c to 253c averaging 241c/kg. The best of the heavy bulls reached 265c/kg."
"There was a slight increase in numbers and the quality was mixed. Yearlings were best supplied and the majority of these went to feeder orders. Grown steers were limited and there was only a few pens of heavy bullocks. Around 350 cows were also offered to a smaller than usual buying group in a cheaper market.

Heavy butcher steer vealers remained firm selling from 182c to 218.2c/kg. The medium and heavy feeder steers slipped 15c to 18c on a plainer run of cattle to range from 156c to 186c averaging 179.6c/kg. Trade steers were 9c easier receiving between 164c and 205c to average 182c/kg and the heifers to the trade sold 3c to 6c stronger 165c to 195c/kg. Feeder heifers eased 8c selling from 142c to 171c/kg.

Grown steers slipped 1c to range from 178c to 194c and the heavy bullocks averaged 195c/kg. The 2 and 4 tooth grown heifers lifted 7c/kg. Cows were 2c to 5c cheaper with the medium weight 2 scores 119c to 128c and the heavy 3 and 4 scores 133c to 150.6c/kg."
"There was a slight increase in numbers and the quality remained good. Young cattle were well represented as were cows. Grown steers and bullocks were in reduced numbers. Not all the usual buyers attended but the market trend was firm to dearer.

Trade vealers were firm for the steers and cheaper for the heifers which were not to the same standard. Most vealers to the trade sold from 190c to 215c/kg and medium weight steers returning to the paddock reached 219c/kg. Yearling trade steers were firm from 180c to 214c/kg. Trade heifers lifted 1c to 2c, with medium and heavy weights between 184c and 213c/kg. Feeder steers and heifers gained 8c to 10c, with the steers ranging from 185c to 215c/kg.

Grown steers and bullocks were unchanged, with the majority selling between 185c and 209c/kg. Cows were firm on most with some of the very heavy cows slightly cheaper. The medium weight 2 score cows ranged from 125c to 158c/kg. The heavy 3 and 4 scores received from 155c to 176c/kg and C muscled cows reached 186c/kg. The best of the heavy bulls made 220c/kg."
"There was a slight increase in numbers and quality and condition was good throughout. There was a sprinkling of vealers among a good selection of young cattle while cows and grown steers were well represented. 

All the usual buyers operated in a firm to cheaper market. Light vealer steers to restockers reached 301c while the bulk of the medium and heavyweights to all orders made 215c to 238c/kg. Most of the vealer heifers made 220c to 235c with a pen of lightweights reaching 265c/kg. Yearling steers eased 7c to 9c with medium and heavy feeders ranging from 195c to 239c/kg. Heavy weights to the trade made 205c to 228c/kg. Yearling heifers to slaughter slipped 3c to 4c while those to feeders averaged 7c/kg dearer. Most made 200c to 215c, after sales reached 222c/kg. 

Grown steers averaged firm, making 184c to 211c/kg, depending on age. Grown heifers ranged from 170c to 200c/kg. Heavy cows held firm while lighter lots tended a shade easier. Medium and heavy 3 and 4 scores ranged from 152c to 175.6c/kg."
"There was a slight decrease in numbers and the quality was mostly good. The offering consisted mainly of yearlings suiting the feeder orders and cows suiting the processors, with lines of PTIC to suit the restockers. There were a few good lines of well-bred weaners retuning to the paddock and a limited supply of grown cattle. All the usual buyers were operating in a mostly strong market.

Yearling steers to suit the trade were firm to a few cents better, selling from 480c to 561c/kg. Yearling heifers to processors were also dearer, making from 480c to 555c/kg. Feedlot buyers were very competitive. Feeder steers lifted 5c, receiving from 480c to 630c, and medium weight heifers to feed averaged 560c/kg. Well-bred weaner steers were dearer ranging from 590c to 715c/kg. The heifer portion also attracted strong competition selling from 570c to 620c/kg.

Grown steers reached 420c, and grown heifers sold from 350c to 465c/kg. The D2 cows were dearer making from 250c to 319c/kg. The heavy weight 4 score cows lifted 4c to average 364c/kg. The best heavy weight bulls reached 356c/kg.

"There was a significant increase in numbers and the quality was mixed. There were some good pens of yearling steers to suit the feeder buyers, along with an increased number of Bos Indicus cattle. There were some good lines of well-bred weaners to suit the restockers and almost 200, mostly heavy weight cows. It was a varied market, with heavy feeder steers and trade cattle selling to cheaper trends and heavy prime cows and young cattle returning to the paddock, selling to dearer trends.
Prime vealers reached 560c/kg. Yearling steers to suit the trade, back 7c, selling from 480c to 550c and yearling heifers to process also cheaper, making from 450c to 570c/kg. Lighter feeder steers were a few cents easier and the heavy feeders were up to 16c/kg cheaper. The limited supply of feeder heifers were firm, ranging from 430c to 540c/kg.. Young cattle to the restockers were dearer. Young steers sold from 420c to 712c and young heifers topped at 625c/kg.
Heavy grown steers lifted 2c, selling from 422c to 495c and the heifer portion were 7c better, reaching 490c/kg.  There was strong competition for cows, with the best heavy prime cows making from 388c to 423c/kg. Heavy bulls were up to 14c/kg dearer, topping at 370c/kg.

"There was a significant decrease in numbers, for a total yarding of 439 of fair to good quality cattle. Yearlings were well supplied, mostly suiting feeder orders and restockers, there was 133 cows penned, and some well bred young steers and heifers to suit restockers. Agents commented that most of the usual buyers were operating in a firm market, although there was insufficient numbers in some categories to get an accurate trend.

There was a limited number of yearlings to suit the trade, with the steers averaging 385c, and the heifers averaged 378c/kg. Feeder steers were firm selling from 360c to 415c/kg. There was keen interest for yearling heifers from feeder orders and restockers. Feeder heifers made from 364c to 398c, and those returning to the paddock reached 408c/kg.  Vealer steers under 280kg selling to restockers made  from 330c to 496c, and the heifer portion averaged 438c/kg.

There were insufficient number of grown steers and heifers to get an accurate quote. The cows attracted keen competition from both processors and restockers, and made from 220c to 292c/kg. The best heavy weight bull reached 280c/kg."
"There was a sharp decline in the numbers offered due to the Easter break. Quality was mixed with a good supply of vealers and weaner steers and heifers. Yearlings were mostly plain which suited the lot feeders and the few pens of prime yearlings sold to strong competition. Grown cattle were limited and the cows varied over all weight and fat scores. The usual group of buyers was smaller.

Vealers to the trade lifted 5c to 8c, ranging from 225c to 253c/kg. Heifer to restockers lifted 7c to 12c ranging from 160c to 284c/kg for light weights. Light yearling steers also gained value to restockers by 12c to 15c and the medium weight feeder steers remained steady even with an extra order in place to sell from 192c to 234c/kg. The few heavy trade steers also gain 10c reaching 246c, while the heifer portion eased up to 4c ranging between 190c and 238c/kg.

Grown steers were very limited ranging from 190c to 205c, whilst an overall plainer cow run had prices back by 3c to 5c/kg. The 3 and 4 score cows ranged from 145c to 165c and the lighter plainer 2 scores ranged from 117c to 150c/kg lwt."
"There was a much larger yarding of 1,630 head, compared to 477 last week.  There was good numbers of feeder cattle and cows were also well supplied.  The yarding of yearling cattle consisted of several runs of well finished steers and heifers suitable for feeders, with very few yearlings going to the trade.  

The market was easier with most feeder steers and heifers selling 20c to 30c cheaper.  Medium weight feeder steers ranged from 420c to 493c, while the heavy feeder steers sold from 390c to 475c/kg.  Feeder heifers sold from 400c to 470c and the few trade heifers toped at 430c/kg.  There was only an odd vealer steers that sold to 650c/kg to restock.

The yarding of export cattle consisted of a good supply of mainly heavy cows , a fair number of grown steers, while there was several pens of grown heifers.  Quality was good however, the market was cheaper, with heavy grown steers selling from 400c to 430c.  Grown heifers were 30c cheaper selling from 320c to 410c feeders to 430c/kg.  The cow market was substantially cheaper by 30c to 35c, with 3 score cows averaging 310c and heavy cows ranged from 315c to 336c/kg.  Heavy bulls toped at 320c/kg.

"There was a good selection of prime cattle in all sections, however overall quality was plainer with larger numbers of unfinished yearlings yarded. All the regular buyers were in attendance including the return of a major export processor.

Trade cattle were firm to 2c cheaper with vealers selling to 211c/kg. Prime yearling steers sold from 170c to 210c, while prime heifer yearlings to kill sold from 160c to 205c/kg. Trade weight feeder steers sold at similar prices with the better quality types selling from 179c to 203c/kg.

Grown steers were firm with the 3 and 4 score medium and heavy weights selling from 180c to 199c, with the 4 score heavy weights averaging 193c/kg. Grown heifers sold to 182c/kg. Export weight feeder steers were 5c cheaper, selling from 165c to 193c/kg. Cows were firm with 1 and 2 scores selling from 60c to 125c, while the better D3 and D4 medium and heavy weights sold from 132c to 156c/kg. A single C muscled cow sold for 160c and the best bull made 175c/kg."
"There was a good representation of prime cattle in all sections though overall it was a plainer quality yarding as seasonal conditions remain dry.

Vealers to the trade were close to firm however yearlings were 5c to 8c/kg cheaper. Vealers to slaughter sold to 246c while the prime yearling steers to slaughter sold from 210c to 245c/kg.

Bulls topped at 233c/kg."
"There was a good quality yarding, with good numbers of cows along with young cattle to suit the feeders and trade buyers. Grown heifers were well supplied, along with a few pens of grown steers. Not all the regular buyers were present, with the absence of a major feeder operator.

Young cattle to the trade were 10c cheaper, with vealers selling to 292c and the prime yearlings selling from 235c to 288c/kg. Feeder steers and heifers were from 2c to 5c/kg cheaper. The feeder steers sold from 226c to 280c, while the feeder heifers sold from 200c to 245c/kg.

The prime heavy weight cows averaged 195c, while bulls sold to 230c/kg."
"There was a decrease in cattle numbers this week. Quality was good with approximately 500 cows, 60 bulls, close to 200 grown cattle and many pens of well bred younger cattle which suited feeders, restockers and processors. The regular buyers attended in an overall stronger market with the feeder cattle averaging from 5c to 10c/kg dearer, with some isolated sales stronger due to the increased demand. It was also of a firm trend for younger trade cattle, while the grown cattle averaged unchanged to 5c/kg easier. The cows sold from firm to 5c dearer, and bulls also sold to a stronger trend from 2c to 10c/kg.

The prime vealers sold from 450c to 502c/kg. Prime steer yearlings made from 400c to 483c, with the heifer portion selling from 400c to 485c/kg. The yearling  steers and heifers going to the feeders and restockers mostly sold from 370c to 487c/kg. They also purchased well bred young steers during the market from 500c to 570c, and heifers up to 524c/kg.

Market Reporter: Tim Delany"
"There was a decline in numbers and the quality slipped. There was an increase in the number of 4 and 6 tooth steers and heifers, while young cattle numbers eased in volume. Around 450 mostly well covered heavy cows were offered to the usual buyers. Feeders were not as active on heavy weights and there was an extra buyer operating in the trade run. Young cattle sold to a dearer trend while the export was mostly cheaper.

Trade veal lifted 15c on the heavy weights, reaching 372c/kg. Heavy feeder steers averaged firm but the top end was not as dear. Medium weights were 4c/kg stronger. Prices ranged from 300c to 357c/kg. Medium weight heifers to feed were 3c dearer, receiving 290c to 326c/kg. The trade steers gained 20c on a limited number, selling from 320c to 350c, and heifers reached 338c/kg.

The grown steers and bullocks eased 15c to 20c, mostly due to the increase in age and less competition on the younger drafts to feedlots, and sold from 265c to 298c/kg. Grown heifers topped at 308c and averaged 270c/kg. The medium weight 2 score cows were 5c dearer, selling from 208c to 226c, and the heavy 3 and 4 scores eased 2c to 5c, ranging from 220c to 239c/kg and averaging 234c/kg."
"The wet cold conditions produced a smaller penning of cattle and quality overall was fair to good. Vealers were well supplied, as the yearling steers suitable for the lot feeders were limited in number. There were ample prime conditioned younger cattle suitable for the butchers and processors in the competition, with some good quality heavy weight grown steers also offered. Cows numbered around 430 head, in total and the usual buyers competed in a dearer market.

Vealer steers to feed and restockers gained 5c to 10c, to range from 170c to 218c, with light weights reaching 231c/kg. Prime heavy weights to the butchers topped at 224c/kg.  Medium weight vealer heifers returning to the paddock also trended 10c to 12c/kg dearer. Heavy weight prime conditioned yearling steers to the butcher and processor orders improved 13c and ranged from 192c to 227c/kg. The similar weighted heifer portion to the same buyers gained 9c and sold from 185c to 223c/kg.

Heavy weight grown steers to slaughter lifted 13c to 15c, as the younger drafts received from 197c to 229c/kg. The older heifers gained 5c and sold from 160c to 212c/kg, depending on age and quality. Cows continued the overall dearer market trend and improved 11c to 14c/kg. The plainer 2 scores averaged 122c, as the better conditioned 3 and 4 scores ranged from 124c to 150c/kg. The best muscled heavy weight bull topped at 193c/kg."
"The wet and miserable weather continues and numbers subsequently fell. The quality was plain with very few prime cattle offered. There was an increase in light weaners which sold to strong restocking competition. Most of the yearlings went to feeder orders with large drafts of cattle limited. Prime grown steers were also in short supply. Cow numbers were back and plainer in quality. Not all of the usual buyers operated in a dearer market.

Light restocking weaners lifted 22c with most selling from 366c to 403c/kg. The few trade vealers were firm reaching 360c/kg. Feeder steers were 5c to 8c dearer ranging from 350c to 382c/kg. Medium weight heifers jumped 20c selling to 358c/kg. Trade steers were similar in price and the heifers lost 4c/kg. Trade cattle ranged from 331c to 362c/kg.

Grown steers over 500kg were limited and sold to a dearer trend with the bulk of the cattle having 2 and 4 teeth. The better covered 4 scores reached 363c/kg. Cows were 10c to 15c stronger with the 2 score medium weights ranged from 223c to 248c while the heavy 3 and 4 scores sold between 246c to 265c/kg. Heavy weight cows averaged 255c/kg."
"The warm dry wind over the weekend with little or no rain forecast saw the numbers more than double. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering with a few heavy steers and a good selection of cows. The quality of the offering was mixed and the condition varied from plain to very good. Demand was strong throughout and despite the increased numbers the market held up well.

A small offering of vealers suitable to the trade sold firm to dearer with the quality also showing a slight improvement. Restockers operated also with heavily muscled vealers selling at very strong rates. Restocker and feedlot orders were active on suitable yearlings. The market for steers in the light and medium weight classes was firm to slightly dearer with medium weights well supported. Heavy feeder steers saw little change while the only variation in yearling steers to the trade was a result of a quality variation. There was a good supply of heifer yearlings suitable to restock and feed the market firm to slightly cheaper. Once again the variation in trade heifer yearlings was a result of quality with the market mainly firm.

There were some very well finished heavy steers penned with the market fully firm. Grown heifers also sold to a firm market trend while a larger offering of cows, most of which carried good condition showed little change. There were some very good heavy bulls penned with the best high yielding lots selling to a dearer trend."
"The total numbers lifted and quality of the trade cattle was mixed. Vealers were supplied in reasonable numbers and yearlings made up the majority of the yarding and of these a large percentage were purchased by feed lotters. Grown cattle were in fewer numbers but most were in good condition. All the usual buyers competed in a cheaper market with the exception of the vealers.

Vealers steers and heifers gained 3c to 6c with those to feeders ranging from 155c to 182c/kg. Those purchased by processors ranged from 159c to 186c for the heifers and the steer portion made from 175c to 190c/kg. Yearlings eased 5c to 8c/kg with quality being the main factor. Medium weight steers to lot feeders sold from 135c to 182c, while those to processors made from 168c to 179c/kg. Heavy heifers to slaughter ranged from 153c to 169c/kg. 

Grown cattle remained firm with the medium weight grown steers to lot feeders averaging 144c/kg. Medium weight steers to slaughter sold from 155c to 160c to be around 5c/kg cheaper. Heavy grown steers made were 5c dearer and made from 146c to 165.6c/kg. The small section of bullocks averaged 156c/kg. The C3 grown heifers sold from 140c to 160c, while the D3 lines ranged from 135c to 140c/kg.

Cow numbers lifted and quality was varied, which encouraged a cheaper trend of 2c/kg. A large percentage of the cows fell into the heavier categories. Heavy D3 and D4 cows ranged from 110c to 128c the medium weights ranged from 114c to 139c to average 124c/kg. A large number of bulls were offered with the best bull making 160c/kg."
"The stronger markets and the disappointment by the amount of rain received by some boosted numbers by 850. It was a good quality yarding with good numbers of young cattle to suit the feeders and processors. There were a few lots of well finished grown steers and heifers and there were large numbers of cows. There were also good numbers of young calves in most runs. A full field of buyers were in attendance and operating.

Young cattle to the trade were dearer with prime heifer yearlings selling from 270c to 285c/kg. Feeder steers were 13c to 16c dearer, while the feeder heifers were up to 24c/kg dearer. The feeder steers sold from 270c to 329c while the feeder heifers sold from 255c to 289c/kg. Young restocker cattle were a little dearer with the young steers selling from 250c to 331c, while the young heifers sold from 200c to 272c/kg.

Prime grown steers were 7c dearer selling from 265c to 300c/kg. Grown heifers were up to 20c dearer with the better types selling from 245c to 285c/kg. Cows were 30c to 35c dearer with the 2 scores selling from 150c to 224c/kg. The better 3 and 4 score cows sold from 205c to 264c with the prime heavy weights averaging 251c/kg. Bulls sold to 285c/kg."
"The strong market of the previous sale combined with the first sale for the new financial year lifted numbers by 1,660 head. Prime young cattle were in very limited supply, though there were good numbers to suit the backgrounders and feeders. There was a fair selection of cows and very few grown steers yarded.

The very best of the young cattle to the trade were close to firm, most though were up to 8c/kg cheaper. Vealers sold to 360c, while the prime steer yearlings sold from 318c to 369c/kg. The better quality feeder steers were firm to 2c cheaper, while the plainer types and feeder heifers were up to 12c/kg cheaper. Feeder steers sold from 315c to 385c, while the feeder heifers sold to 335c/kg. Young steers to the restockers were firm to a little dearer, selling to 410c/kg.

The few grown steers were firm with the prime medium and heavy weights selling from 325c to 350c/kg. Grown heifers sold to 347c/kg. Most grades of cows were 25c cheaper with the 2 scores selling from 175c to 228c, while the better 3 and 4 scores sold from 220c to 265c, with the 4 score heavy weights averaging 252c/kg. Bulls sold to 276c/kg."
"The shorter working week produced a smaller yarding of fair to good quality cattle. Younger cattle were well supplied, grown steers were reduced and around 370 cows were penned. The usual buyers competed in a firm to slightly cheaper market.

Heavy vealers to the butchers remained firm with only quality affecting prices in places as the better bred pens ranged from 212c to 234c/kg. Yearling steers to lot feeders remained firm as heavy weights to the trade lost 2c to reach 223c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed sold to strong competition, while quality slipped for the heavy weights to the butchers with these ranging from 175c to 214c/kg.

Grown steers to lot feeders slipped 3c as heavy weights to slaughter sold at similar values to top at 190c/kg. The heifer portion eased back 5c/kg. Cows found the competition tougher and slipped 5c/kg in value. The plainer 2 scores averaged 137c as the better finished 3 and 4 scores ranged from 141c to 154c/kg. Restockers competed on selected lines with the best reaching 160c/kg."
"The short working week led to a reduction in numbers. There was a good supply of yearlings along with a few vealers. Cows made up the bulk of the grown cattle with very few well finished heavy grown steers. The quality of the offering was very mixed. There were some very good quality medium and heavyweight yearling feeder steers. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Market trends varied through the young cattle. Good quality vealer steers to restockers remained firm with some quality related price change. A few well finished heifer vealers to the trade sold firm to slightly dearer. Secondary quality vealers to restockers sold to cheaper trends with restricted restocker activity. Medium and heavyweight yearling steers sold on a firm to slightly dearer trend with some improved quality lines attracting strong competition. Yearling heifers to feed sold to a cheaper trend. The better quality heifers were least affected while the secondary heifers were significantly cheaper. This was the case in all classes.

The limited supply of heavy grown steers were as much as 15c/kg cheaper. The cow market saw a large number of plainer condition cows sell firm to slightly dearer with odd pens showing a quality improvement. The well finished heavyweight cows sold to a slightly cheaper trend. The best of the heavyweight bulls were up to 4c/kg dearer."
"The second last sale for the year produced a larger offering of mixed quality cattle. Vealers were scarce, while the yearlings were well supplied. There was a good selection of grown steers suitable for slaughter and around 350 cows were yarded. Prices were 1c to 3c/kg either side of firm.

Bulls sold to 286c/kg."
"The rain keeps coming at Carcoar and with it the small numbers continue. It was a good quality yarding with good numbers of prime yearlings throughout. There were no grown steers yarded, and just limited numbers of grown heifers and cows. It was a typical wet weather market with most of the usual buyers competing for a share of the small numbers. 

Young cattle to the trade were 10c to 15c dearer, with prime vealers selling to 486c/kg. Prime steer yearlings sold from  390c to 440c, while the prime heifer yearlings sold from 388c to 470c/kg.

The next CTLX cattle sale will be Tuesday 6th January 2015."
"The quality of the yarding was not quite as good as the previous sale, though there were still good numbers of well finished cattle in all sections. Not all the regular buyers were operating for what was a mostly tougher market.

"The quality of the yarding was back a little though there were still good numbers of young cattle to suit the feeders and processors. There was also a good selection of well finished grown steers and heifers, and there were around 350 cows yarded, which were mostly in prime condition. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance and operating. 

Young cattle to the trade were 8c dearer with prime vealers selling from 425c to 492c/kg. Prime steer yearlings sold from 400c to 481c, while the prime heifer yearlings sold to 466c/kg.

"The penning rose 40% to offer a very good yarding of heavy feeder steers as well as an increased quality cow penning .There was one exporter absent, the other regular operators attended, with particular demand through the feeder pens, for both steers and heifers.

A slight correction in quality saw the weaner section sell to cheaper trends, steers to 599c/kg, the heifers 490c to 534c/kg, to ease back in price by 11c/kg. The better presented medium weight yearling steers sold to a dearer trend making up to 579c, while the heavy drafts sold to 515c/kg.

MLA Reporter Stephen Adams"
"The numbers almost halved in a mixed quality offering. All grades were represented although yearlings were in fair numbers. All regular buyers were in attendance with most operating to capacity. There was an odd feedlot order not operating on heifer yearlings. A cheaper market was experienced through nearly all grades.

There were very few vealers of any quality penned, an odd better vealer sold to butchers at cheaper rates. Yearling steers to restock and feed in the light and medium weight classes sold to a cheaper trend, down 9c to 11c/kg with average quality also down. The limited number of heavy feeder steers sold firm. Trade yearling steers also sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c/kg.The lesser feedlot competition on yearling heifers saw those to restock and feed sell to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 8c/kg with odd sales a bit more. The C3 trade yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend, down 8c to 13c/kg. Once again the average quality of the yearling heifers was not as good as the previous sale.

There were some well finished, good quality heavy steers penned. The market was cheaper, down 3c to 8c/kg, with grown heifers following a similar trend. The cow market also saw a cheaper trend, down 3c to 5c with heavy bulls up to 10c/kg cheaper."
"The number of cattle penned at CTLX Carcoar experienced a small lift of 170 head to 1,854.  The regular panel of buyers was present and active in a firm to dearer market. Good quality lines of feeder steers and cows dominated the yarding with only a handful reflecting the cold conditions.

Medium weight yearling steers to feed made to 437c to average 402c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed were well supplied and sold to 417c with the largest numbers from 387c to 392c/kg. A small sample to the local trade market made to 386c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers made to 324c and poor quality lines 180c/kg.

"The long weekend holiday combined with extra rainfall produced a smaller yarding of mixed quality cattle. Vealers were scarce, while good numbers of yearlings were penned, with fair percentages of grown steers and heifers also yarded. Fair numbers of cows were offered with around 150 yarded. The market trend overall was dearer.

Yearling steers selling to lot feeders and restockers improved 9c as the light and medium weights ranged from 199c to 210c/kg. Heavy weights to lot feeders remained firm as those selling to trade orders lifted 8c/kg. The yearling heifers gained 4c to 5c/kg with the better quality offered pushing values higher in places.

Grown steers to slaughter remained similar in value as the heavy weights ranged from 186c to 191c/kg. The heifer portion also sold at firm rates as the best reached 186c/kg.

Cows sold to solid competition to remain firm to 3c dearer as the plainer D2 pens averaged 143c/kg. The medium and heavy weight D3 and D4 cows ranged from 145c to 155c as the better muscled pens reached 164c/kg. Heavy bulls sold at similar rates as the best reached 180c/kg."
"The long weekend and rainfall recorded at most of the supply area caused numbers to slip while the quality of the cattle yarded lifted compared to the last market. Fair numbers of vealer were penned with some purchased by trade orders while the balance sold to the restockers. The yearlings were well represented while good numbers of feeders steers were yarded however heavy weights suitable for slaughter were scarce in the pens. The cow yarding was mixed in quality while fair numbers were penned. The usual buying orders competed and the market trend was dearer.

Vealer steers returning to the paddock lifted 4c, while the better quality offered were the heavier prime pens to the trade which sold higher values. The vealer heifers to the trade improved 8c to 10c to range from 155c to 179c/kg. The yearling steers improved 3c to 8c with both lot feeders and the trade competing strongly to secure numbers. The better yearling heifers also sold to solid competition as heavy weights to the trade improved substantially in quality to range from 154c to 185c/kg.

Steers to lot feeders gained 9c to average 171c/kg, while the limited supply of grown steers to slaughter showed little change in value. Grown heifers were also reduced in numbers causing values for the better drafts to lift 3c/kg. Cows gained 3c to 4c with the better finished medium and heavy D3 and D4 pens ranging from 123c to 130c/kg. Heavy bulls improved 2c to 4c as the best reached 164c/kg."
"The last sale of 2017 saw numbers jump. Quality was mostly good with plenty of feeder cattle on offer. Trade cattle were limited and there was a good run of grown steers and bullocks. Around 450 cows were penned with a large percentage of heavy weights. All the usual buyers operated in a cheaper market.

Light restocking steers vealers reached 411c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers eased 3c while heavy weights were back 7c/kg. Prices ranged from 272c to 329c/kg. Feeder heifers were back 5c on the medium weights and sold from 272c to 305c with heavy weights reaching 283c/kg. The few trade cattle sold to 310c/kg.

Grown steers to processors eased 5c receiving 252c to 272c and heavy bullocks were firm and sold from 260c to 270c/kg. Heavy feeder steers were 4c cheaper and sold to 277c/kg. Medium weight cows were firm with the 2 and 3 scores selling from 180c to 222c/kg. Heavy 3 and 4 scores eased 2c to 3c ranging from 210c to 229c/kg. The first sale in the new year will be on the 9th of January."
"The last sale for the year produced a smaller offering with greater percentages of the younger vealers yarded. Fair numbers of yearlings were offered with the heifers outnumbering the steer portion with the majority selling to feeder orders. Grown steers and heifer numbers slipped, while there was a good yarding of cows penned.

The 200kg plus vealer steers and heifers to feeders, restockers and the trade improved 10c to 15c/kg. The lightweight yearling steers to feeders and restockers improved 15c, while heavy weights lifted 7c/kg. Yearling heifers also sold to solid competition with those selling to the feeders gaining 8c to 10c/kg compared to the recent cheaper markets.

Grown steers to lot feeders sold at firm rates, while the heavy weights to slaughter remained firm as the bullocks improved 4c/kg. The grown heifer portion improved 2c as the best heavy weights reached 146c/kg.

Cows continue to sell at cheaper rates as values slipped another 4c to 7c/kg. The plainer D2 pens averaged 101c as the medium and heavy weight D3 and D4 cows ranged from 100c to 114c with C muscles reaching 116c/kg. Heavy bulls lost 5c to 6c with the best reaching 120c/kg.

The next sale is on the 5th January 2010."
"The last sale for 2011 produced a small offering of mixed quality cattle. Most weights and grades were represented, however in limited numbers. The usual buyers competed and prices varied in places mainly because of numbers and quality, however generally remained solid throughout most categories.

Vealer steers returning to the paddock ranged from 228c to 256c/kg. The same weight heifer portion to lot feeders sold from 200c to 224c/kg. Yearling steers to lot feeders and restockers remained firm to 5c cheaper as the best light and medium weights reached 239c/kg.

Cows sold at similar values compared to the last sale with the plainer D2 pens averaging 151c/kg. The better finished 3 and 4 score cows ranged from 162c to 165c/kg. The best heavy weight bull to producer orders reached 185.6c/kg."
"The last CTLX prime cattle sale for 2013 produced a smaller yarding, as numbers halved, week-on-week. Lightweight younger cattle lifted in number, as producers were keen to offload before the holiday break. Yearling steers suitable for the restockers and lot feeders were well supplied, as some good runs of the heifer portion were also penned. There were very few prime younger cattle suitable for the local trade offered. Grown steers were limited in supply, as cow numbers also fell sharply. Some orders failed to compete, however the smaller offering kept prices at a firm to dearer level.

Quality and the dryer seasonal conditions produced cheaper trends for the vealer steers and heifer categories. Yearling steers to lot feeders and restockers gained from 2c to 6c, as the medium weights ranged from 165c to 194c, while well bred heavy weights topped at 199.6c/kg. Yearling heifers to the same orders remained firm to 5c/kg dearer, with some better quality larger runs yarded.

Grown steers to slaughter enjoyed stronger competition, mainly due to the lower consignments penned, with prices lifting 10c to 12c/kg. The heifer portion recovered most of the losses recorded at the previous market to gain 15c, as the best reached 164c/kg. Cows sold 5c to 10c dearer, as the plainer 2 scores averaged 97c, while the better finished 3 and 4 scores ranged from 120c to 140c/kg. Heavy weight bulls struggled to maintain firm prices, and trended 2c to 4c/kg cheaper. 

The next prime cattle sale will commence on the 7/1/2014."
"The last CTLX cattle sale for 2012 produced a smaller offering of plainer quality cattle. Vealers were scarce as good runs of yearlings were penned. Fair numbers of grown steers and heifers with around 350 cows yarded. The market trend was cheaper as very little interest was shown for any plainer poorly bred lines.

Vealer heifers suitable for the trade sold well to range from 172c to 196c/kg. Yearling steers to restocker and feeder orders lost 4c as medium weights sold from 160c to 182c and heavy weights ranged from 155c to 178c/kg. The better quality end of yearling heifers to the feeders lost 11c/kg as greater falls were suffered by the plainer pens.

Medium weight grown steers to lot feeders remained around firm as the best topped at 174c/kg. Heavy weight steers and bullocks to slaughter sold 1c to 2c/kg cheaper to range from 155c to 176c/kg. The heifer portion sold from 140c to 159c/kg.

Cows continued the cheaper trend to slip from 5c to 8c/kg and more in places for any plainer pens. The 2 scores averaged 104c as the better finished 3 and 4 scores ranged from 108c to 134c/kg. Heavy bulls eased back from 12c to 17c as the best reached 144c/kg."
"The last CTLX Carcoar cattle sale for the year produced a small offering of mixed quality lines, with good percentages of the yearling categories yarded. Grown steers and heifers were reduced and around 65 cows were penned.

Yearling steers to lot feeders gained 2c as the medium weights ranged from 214c to 223c, while the heavy weights averaged 212c/kg. The heavy yearling steers to the trade sold at dearer levels to reach 223c/kg. Yearling heifers to lot feeders lifted 4c, while the heavy weights to the trade and processors improved 3c/kg in value.

Medium weight steers to lot feeders gained 5c as the heavy weights to slaughter remained firm to slightly easier to reach 185c/kg. The heifer portion sold at similar rates to reach 178c/kg.

Cows struggled to remain firm with some processors absent, easing 1c to 2c/kg. The D3 and D4 pens ranged from 140c to 151c, while the C muscles reached 155c/kg. Bulls sold at firm rates with very few yarded."
"The last cattle sale for the year produced a smaller yarding with numbers falling by 2,200 head. It was a good quality yarding with good numbers of yearlings to suit both the feeders and processors. There was also good numbers of cows and only limited numbers of properly finished grown heifers and no grown steers. Not all the regular buyers were present with the absence of some export processors.

Bulls sold to 223c/kg."
"The last cattle sale for the year produced a smaller yarding with numbers falling by 1,000 head. It was still a pretty good quality yarding with the usual good runs of ideal feeder cattle along with good numbers of young cattle to suit the trade. Grown heifers were well supplied, grown steers were limited and there were 150 cows yarded. Most of the usual buyers were operating except for a feeder buyer who was present at the previous sale.

Young cattle to the trade were 9c dearer with prime vealers selling to 608c/kg. Prime steer yearlings sold from 480c to 580c, while the prime heifer yearlings sold from 432c also to 580c/kg.

"The last cattle sale for Carcoar for the year produced a much smaller yarding. It was a good quality yarding with a good selection of young cattle to suit both the processors and feeders. There were a few grown steers and heifers and the cows in the yarding were mostly prime. Most of the usual buyers were in attendance and operating in a mostly stronger market.

Young cattle to the trade were around firm with prime vealers selling to 425c/kg. Prime steer yearlings sold from 351c to 380c while the prime heifer yearlings sold from 340c to 400c/kg.

Bulls sold to 226c/kg."
"The lack of adequate feed and water supplies produced record numbers for a prime cattle sale. Younger cattle were well supplied, while grown steers and heifers were limited in number. There was another substantial yarding of cows, with most weights and grades represented. The usual buyers competed and, considering the record numbers offered, prices held up particularly well.

The younger weaner steers and heifers remained firm to slightly dearer. The yearling steers to lot feeder orders improved by 4c to 7c, as prices for the medium weights ranged from 155c to 186c/kg.

All the usual buyers were in attendance but not all of them were operating, selling mostly to a cheaper trend
.
Restocker weaner steers were considerably cheaper, selling from 501c to 599c/kg and the heifer portion was also firm making from 480c to 500c/kg.

"The improved weather conditions produced a larger penning of cattle and quality remained mixed, as fewer prime conditioned younger drafts were yarded. There were good runs of younger cattle suitable for the feeder competition, with fair runs of grown steers, heifers and cows. Competition was considerably weaker for the export pens, as lot feeders were again strong in the bidding for the suitable younger lines.

Medium weight vealer steers returning to the paddock lost 3c and sold from 169c to 210c/kg, depending on the breed offered. The equal weighted heifer portion to the same orders remained close to firm to average 161c/kg. Heavy weights to the butchers struggled to remain firm, however quality and yield was lower week-on-week. Yearling steers to the lot feeders sold 3c to 4c either side of firm, as the heavier weights sold to the stronger competition to average 209c after reaching 217c/kg. The medium weight yearling heifers to lot feeder orders also sold close to firm, while both the prime yearling steers and heifers eased in price, although quality also slipped compared to the previous market.

Heavy weight grown steers to slaughter failed to reach the high price recorded at the last sale, however averaged around firm overall considering the older ages sold this week. Prices ranged from 193c to 211c/kg. The younger heifers purchased by the export processors sold well to reach 200c, as the older pens struggled in the competition and lost 5c/kg. Cows sold to weaker demand with the majority of processors attaining adequate slaughter supplies. Prices were 13c to 20c lower, as the plainer 2 scores averaged 104c/kg. The better covered 3 and 4 scores ranged from 105c to 140c/kg. Heavy weight bulls slipped 10c, as the best reached 179c/kg."

"The first sale of the year penned 794 head. Quality was mixed with a large percentage of the cattle lacking finish. Yearlings made up the majority of the offering and the grown steers and bullocks were in short supply. Cows were reasonably well supplied. Not all the usual buyers operated in a much stronger market.

"The first sale for 2014 produced a larger penning of mixed quality cattle. Yearlings were well supplied, as the heavy weight steers suitable for slaughter were reduced in number. There was a fair yarding of older heifers, while the hot dry conditions, along with a shortage of ground water, lifted cow numbers, with over 900 offered. Northern restocker and feeder competition on the younger drafts was reduced, again mainly due to the seasonal conditions, while the cow categories met solid processor demand.

Yearling steers to restocker and lot feeder orders lost 5c to 7c, as the medium weights ranged from 150c to 192c/kg. The heifer portion to the same orders slipped 2c to 8c, with plainer pens struggling to attract competition. Heavy weights to the butchers eased 10c to 12c, to range from 139c to 160c/kg.

"The first cattle sale for 2013 produced a slightly smaller market and quality remained mixed. There were good runs of yearlings with most suitable for feeder and restocker purchases. Heavy grown steers were represented by well finished pens suitable for slaughter together with some unfinished lots selling to feeder orders. 

A cheaper trend throughout the younger steer and heifer categories was evident, however the better selection of yearling heifers sold to restocker and feeder orders remained firm to 3c/kg dearer. Heavy weight yearling steers to lot feeders were also less affected to ease back to only 2c/kg.

Yearling heifers were well represented, with the bulk also selling to the lot feeders and restockers. Export weight cattle were well supplied, as percentages of the steers and heifers carried plenty of weight. Cows were plentiful with most weights and grades represented.

"That would be the smallest yarding at Carcoar for some time with numbers dropping by 750 head. It was a good quality yarding with a few pens of yearlings ideal for the feeders along with some well finished young cattle to suit the processors. There were also some good quality young cattle to suit the restockers but very few grown steers and heifers. There were just 65 cows yarded.

The market trend was mainly cheaper with restocker steer vealers back 9c to 12c/kg with some sales more affected.  Light heifer vealers slipped by 11c while medium weight vealers eased by 7c/kg.  Yearling steers which sold to the processors fared the best to be fully firm to 5c/kg stronger.  Restocker buyers kept values firm to 4c/kg easier.  Feeder steers also lost ground and sold from 142c to 185c/kg depending on breed quality. Trade heifers sold to processing orders at rates 4c to 7c/kg below last sale, while heifers to go on to feed eased 3c to 5c/kg.

There was a fair penning of grown steers and bullocks and most sales were 4c/kg back. Medium weight grown steers sold from 158c to 167c, while C3 heavy grown steers sold from 147c to 165c/kg. The heavy C4 lines made from 158c to 169c/kg. The C3 bullocks averaged 145c, while the C4 lines made 154c/kg. Grown heifers sold from 140c to 164c to average 154.3c/kg. 

Cows were in fair numbers and while the lighter conditioned pens lost 9c the better covered lines sold firm to 3c/kg easier. The D2 medium weight cows made from 90c to 113c, while the D3 lines sold from 108c to 128c to be 3c/kg cheaper. Heavyweight cows were unchanged and made from 115c to 129c/kg. Lightweight bulls averaged 142c, while the medium weights C2 made from 118c to 120c/kg. Heavy C3 bulls sold from 132c to 157c/kg."
"Supply increased by 856 for a yarding of 1944 cattle. Quality was mixed with mostly lightweight cattle yarded suitable for feeders and restockers, however competition lacked in places. Heavy prime cattle were in demand and well supplied. Most of the cows supplied were medium weights with limited heavyweights on offer. Most of the regular buyers were present.

Young cattle to the trade held firm, prime yearling steers sold from 260c to 342c, and prime yearling heifers, 280c to 330c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers dropped 10c, 310c to 370c, and feeder heifers were firm to 5c cheaper, 240c to 315c/kg. Lightweight restocker steers sold dearer, 286c to 429c, while restocker heifers fell 20c, 214c to 320c/kg.

"Substantial rainfall around the supply area reduced numbers and quality remained mixed. Vealers were limited in supply as good runs of yearlings were penned. Older steers were mainly suitable for lot feeder purchases and around 450 cows were offered. The usual orders competed and competition was stronger as most categories sold 10c to 20c/kg dearer.

Lightweight vealer steers to restockers ranged from 190c to 207c/kg. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to lot feeders and restockers improved 12c to sell from 168c to 190.6c as the few heavy weights to the trade topped at 182c/kg. Yearling heifers to feeder orders gained 14c selling from 136c to 167c as those heavy weights to the butchers lifted 18c/kg.

Heavy grown steers to slaughter gained 4c to 8c/kg as greater gains were recorded for the lighter weights to feeder orders. The heifer portion improved 9c as the best topped at 161c/kg. Cows continued the dearer trend to gain 10c to 12c/kg. Plainer 2 scores averaged 115c as the better covered 3 and 4 scores sold from 122c to 140c/kg. The best heavy weight bull reached 158c/kg."
"Similar numbers were yarded compared to the last market and quality for the younger cattle was on the plain side. The younger lots made up the bulk yarded while few heavyweight prime conditioned steers were offered. The cows were mixed with some plain unfinished pens together with the well finished medium and heavyweight pens.

The lack of decent rainfall around the supply area and with the colder weather approaching most of the younger cattle suitable for lot feeders and restockers struggled in the competition. The medium weight vealer steers lost 9c, while the same weighted heifer portion slipped back 4c/kg. The heavy pens suitable for the trade buyers maintained their firm values compared to the last sale. Yearling steers to lot feeders eased 5c; however those heavyweights to the trade sold to solid competition. The yearling heifers overall slipped 3c/kg.

The few heavyweight milk tooth grown steers reached a top of 174c, with the heifer portion easing 5c to average 145c/kg. Cows generally sold firm to a shade dearer as the plain D2 pens averaged 112c, while the better finished medium and heavyweight D3 and D4 drafts ranged from 112c to 133c/kg. The bulls sold from 106.2c to 148c/kg, the heavyweight bulls were plain with a few well muscled lots offered."
"Rainfall recorded around the supply area reduced numbers for a fair to good quality offering of cattle. The younger drafts, together with the grown steers and heifers were well supplied, as a good representation of cows was also penned. The usual buyers competed in a firm to dearer market.

Vealers sold to dearer trends, as the prime conditioned heavier weights to the butchers improved 7c/kg. Greater gains were recorded for the lighter weights to the restocker orders. Yearling steers over 400kg to lot feeder orders lifted 7c and ranged from 196c to 217c/kg. The same weighted prime conditioned pens to the butchers gained 4c and topped at 218c, with a single B muscle reaching 220c/kg.

Heavy weight grown steers sold close to firm, with prices averaging from 198c to 201c, as the youngest reached 208c/kg. The heifer portion remained firm to 2c dearer, as the best reached 190c/kg. Cows gained from 8c to 12c, with the plainer 2 scores averaging 139c/kg. The better covered 3 and 4 scores sold from 134c to 175c/kg. Heavy weight bulls maintained solid prices, as the best reached 199.6c/kg."

"Rain in the supply area reduced numbers and the quality remained average. Prime young cattle were limited and most suited feeder orders. Grown steers and bullocks remain in short supply and around 350 cows were offered. All the usual buyers competed in a strong market that lifted 20c/kg and more across most of the yarding.

"Quality was very good and the offering was made up of a selection of young cattle suiting both feeders and processors which sold unchanged, to a few cents dearer due to feeder competition. There also was approximately 600 cows, most showing weight with grown cattle in short supply.  All the regular processor and feeder buyers were present in a market that fluctuated in places. The grown cattle sold to a firm market while heavy cows improved in value by up to 10c/kg dearer, bulls also improved.

"Once again, cows and young cattle made up the bulk of the yarding as the need to offload continues.

Weight for age was favoured in the heavy steers market with the best cattle remaining firm. The older steers sold to a cheaper trend and were more in number as Heavy C4 lines topped at 179Â¢ to make 172Â¢/kg. Grown heifers also sold to a cheaper trend.

"Numbers were back with substantial rainfall in the supply area. Quality was plainer with prime kill cattle in short supply.

"Numbers were back slightly for a good quality yarding. Weaners and yearlings were well supplied and there was solid competition from feeder and restocking orders. Grown cattle with weight were limited in numbers, and there was a mixed quality run of cows, and restockers were active on the right classes of cows. Trade cattle were limited in numbers, and all the usual buyer attended but not all operated in a market where prices were firm to 5c/kg softer on the limited supply.

"Numbers were back slightly but the quality of the yarding was noticeably plainer than last week although there were some good well bred lines scattered throughout that attracted strong bidding. Despite the lack of quality across all categories the market trended dearer by 10c to 20c/kg and more in places. The inclusion of an extra feeder and processor buyer assisted in pushing prices higher across the board. 

The vealer steers sold to dearer trend with the best of the steer reaching 425c to average close to 400c while the 200-280kg vealer heifers returning to the paddock also lifted 23c, reaching a top of 378c to average 350c/kg.

The better covered cows eased 4c to 5c for the medium and heavy weights with prices ranging from 116c to 142c averaging 130c/kg."
"Numbers were back due to continuing wet weather. Quality was good on most cattle, with yearlings being best supplied, with a fair percentage off crops.

"Numbers remained similar for a mixed quality offering of cattle with extra vealers presented, while the yearling steers slipped back in number. Good percentages of yearling heifers were yarded, while the heavyweight steers and bullocks were mainly older compared to the last market. Fair numbers of grown heifers together with a good offering of cows were also yarded and the market overall sold to a cheaper trend.

Vealer steers improved in quality and sold to solid competition as the better bred drafts ranged from 231c to 260c/kg. The heifer portion also to restocker orders averaged 217c to 223c as the best heavier weight to the trade reached 236c/kg. The best yearling steers to restockers topped at 229c with trade buyers paying up to 225c/kg to secure their selection. Breed and quality contributed to any price variations for yearling heifers selling to feeder and restocker orders, while those suitable for the trade sold 2c to 3c/kg dearer.

Heavy grown steers and heifers to slaughter showed little change in value as the best steer reached 194c/kg. Cows also sold at firm prices as the plainer 2 scores averaged 139c, while the better finished 3 and 4 scores ranged from 139c to 158c/kg. Heavy bulls gained 2c to 3c/kg."
"Numbers remained similar and quality ranged from fair to good.

Cows sold at similar values as the plainer D2s averaged 138c/kg. The better covered D3 and D4 cows ranged from 135c to 154c/kg."
"Numbers remained high for a mixed quality offering of cattle. Vealer steers were scarce, while fair numbers of the heifer portion was yarded. The yearlings were well supplied especially the heifer categories, while good numbers of grown steers suitable for lot feeders and slaughter were penned. The older heifers remained around the same in number and the majority of the cows were good quality with fair yields.

The younger vealer steers lost 2c, as the heifer portion improved 5c/kg in value. Light and medium weight yearling steers to lot feeders lost 4c to 5c/kg, however the heavy weights also selling to lot feeders remained around firm in value with a northern lotfeeders keen to secure numbers.

Medium weight vealer steers and heifers remained firm with the steer portion returning to the paddock ranging from 175c to 195c/kg. Yearling steers showed little change as lightweights to lot feeders averaged 188c, while the heavyweights to the trade ranged from 185c to 205c/kg. Trade yearling heifers remained firm with the best reaching 205c, however most sales were around 185c to 189c/kg.

Grown steers continue to sell well with heavyweights ranging from 172c to 200c/kg. Export heifers struggled in the competition and quality contributed to falls of 5c to 7c/kg. The few cows sold to a mixed trend as the plain pens slipped 7c/kg while the better finished heavyweights remained firm. The best muscled heavy bulls remained around firm and reached 179c/kg."
"Numbers remained consistent for a mixed quality yarding of cattle. There were greater numbers of calves split from cows together with reasonable amounts of yearlings in the market. The grown steers and heifers were well represented along with a good yarding of cows penned in a cheaper market.

The very good quality calves selling to restockers ranged from 162c to 231c/kg. Medium weight yearling steers selling to restockers and lot feeders lost 5c, as the heavy weights to slaughter slipped back 7c/kg in value.

Heavy bulls followed the lower prices and eased 7c to 10c/kg."
"Numbers reduced, with substantial rain over the supply area. Quality remains plain on the young cattle. There was a small but good run of vealers. Feedlot orders picked up most of the yearlings and prime cattle were in limited numbers. Grown steers and bullocks were in short supply and there was a large run of cows. All the usual buying orders were in place in a dearer market.

Vealers to restocking orders lifted 14c, with steers selling from 263c to 319c/kg. Feeder steers gained 17c with most ranging from 300c to 325c/kg.

Steers sold from 298c to 327c and heifers 280c to 324c/kg.

Grown steers were 20c dearer and more in places on a run of well finished Angus steers and sold between 255c and 324c to average 320c/kg. Cows also had strong competition and prices reflected this. Most cows gained 10c to 15c/kg. The 2 score cows ranged from 160c to 211c/kg. Heavy 3 and 4 scores 200c to 230c and C muscled cows reached 238c/kg. The best of the heavy bulls reached 278c and the best of the light weights 373c/kg."
"Numbers reduced with quality and condition offered very mixed. There was a good supply of yearlings along with a few vealers and heavy steers. Cows were in good numbers and the quality showed an improvement. The regular orders were in attendance along with a little extra feeder competition and the re-introduction of a Northern export processor after a long absence.

The market for young cattle showed variable trends. The better quality yearling steers to restock and feed saw prices firm to slightly dearer, while the secondary quality lots sold cheaper. That variation in quality also affected average price changes. Heavy trade yearling steers also sold to a cheaper trend, down 5c/kg. Trends were similar through the heifer yearlings with some good quality light and medium weights selling to restockers at dearer prices, while secondary quality lots struggled at times. Well finished trade heifers also sold to a cheaper trend. 

Heavy grown steers sold to a slightly cheaper trend with quality a factor. The cow market saw plainer condition cows remain firm with quality related price changes. The quality along with the extra competition saw the better 3 and 4 score cows sell to a dearer trend with heavy C muscles up to 10c dearer and the balance up 3c to 4c/kg."
"Numbers reduced slightly to see quality lift through the feeder cattle, which provided the bulk of the offering. The cow penning also improved in quality and weight to see significant rises through the heavy drafts. Feeder operators provided strong demand.

Limited steer weaners sold to considerably strong demand despite the lack of numbers, heifers not so much. Yearling steers to feed saw very strong demand, for both medium and heavy weights. Medium weights sold to dearer trends of 19c, the heavy drafts as much as 40c to top at 553c/kg. Very heavy young cattle were up 8c/kg dearer to processors. Feeder heifers also on an upward trend, with a rise of 9c/kg. Trade heifers sold to 17c/kg better.

Heavy grown steers to processors were slightly cheaper to be back 8c/kg. Conversely heavy grown heifers saw a rise of 25c/kg. Medium weight cows sold to a slightly cheaper trend, to be back by 5c/kg. The heavy cows however lifted in weight to see the top drafts sell to 366c to gain 11c/kg. The best heavy weight bulls improved in price by 3c/kg.

"Numbers reduced greatly and quality was fair to good with very few vealers penned. Yearlings were well supplied with a fair offering of grown steers and heifers in the yarding. There were around 270 cows penned and the usual buying orders competed with competition marginally weaker across most categories.

Light and medium weight yearling steers to lot feeders and restockers remained firm to 6c cheaper to sell from 215c to 226c/kg. Heavy weights also to the lot feeders and agent orders sold 2c either side of firm with the best to the trade reaching 224c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed lost 5c as heavy weights to trade buyers topped at 212c/kg.

Grown steers to lot feeders eased 7c as heavy weights to slaughter slipped 3c to 8c to range from 170c to 185c/kg. Cows found the competition weaker and lost 5c to 8c/kg and more in places. The plainer D2 cows averaged 133c, while the better covered 3 and 4 scores ranged from 136c to 152c/kg."
"Numbers reduced and the quality continues to remain plain with prime cattle in short supply. There were large drafts of yearling cattle which suited the feeder orders. Vealers were keenly sought after by Restockers. Grown steers were in fewer numbers and there was a small but better run of grown heifers. Cow quality was good with plenty having weight and cover. All the usual buyers were back and operating in a fluctuating market.

Restocking vealers sold 6c to 12c dearer with lights steers selling up to 437c/kg. Trade vealers were limited but a small number of medium weighted vealer heifers sold 20c dearer selling to 390c/kg. Feeder steers were firm on the medium weights but eased 13c/kg on the heavy weights. Steers ranged from 366c to 420c/kg. Medium weight heifers to feed were dearer by up to 15c ranging from 339c to 373c/kg. Trade steers were very limited and averaged 369c and the heavy trade heifers were 9c/kg stronger due to strong supermarket competition. Prices ranged from 340c to 365c/kg.

Grown steers and heifers were similar with steers selling from 340c to 375c and the better heifers 259.2c to 285c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows were dearer on a smaller run receiving 228c to 251c/kg. Heavy cows were 10c cheaper ranging from 259c to 285c averaging 277c/kg."
"Numbers nearly halved and quality lifted week-on-week. The younger cattle were well supplied percentage wise, as grown steers suitable for slaughter were limited in supply. There were fair runs of cows, with some high yielding heavy weights penned. Competition was similar for the younger cattle, while export processors lifted prices for the heavier older drafts.

Medium weight vealer steers returning to the paddock sold close enough to firm, to range from 167c to 204c/kg, depending on breed and quality. The better finished vealers suitable for the trade and butcher orders gained 7c, to reach 213c/kg. Yearling steers to lot feeders also showed little change in price, as the medium weights sold from 165c to 205c/kg. The same weight heifer portion to the same orders lifted 8c, as the best reached 177c/kg. The heavier prime conditioned yearlings to the butchers sold slightly dearer, to top at 207c/kg.

Heavy weight grown steers and bullocks to slaughter improved 8c, as prices ranged from 172c to 187c/kg. The heifer portion lifted 10c/kg.

Heavy weight bulls also enjoyed stronger processor competition and lifted 15c/kg."
"Numbers more than halved for a fair to good quality offering of cattle. Good percentages of vealers together with some good runs of yearlings were yarded. There were also some fair pens of grown steers, heifers and cows offered.

The medium weight vealer steers and heifers returning to the paddock improved 10c to 15c with the steer portion ranging from 226c to 240c, while the heifers sold from 183c to 211c/kg.

"Numbers lifted with 3630 mixed quality cattle yarded. The majority of the sale was made up of young feeder cattle along with a large supply of cows of mostly store types. There was also good numbers of heavy prime cattle cattle. The large yarding saw prices and competition from the buyers ease as the sale progressed.

Young cattle to the trade were 20c to 30c cheaper. Yearling steers to process sold from 280c to 339c and yearling heifers 260c to 311c/kg.

"Numbers lifted while quality remained mixed. There were plenty of light and plain weaners, along with better supply of feeder steers and heifers. Additionally, there were a few better runs of medium weights. Grown steers were also better supplied and carrying some weight. Around 500 cows were offered to a larger group of buyers.

Weaner steers to restockers and feeders held firm, making from 210c to 284c/kg. Medium and heavy feeder steers were 2c to 4c cheaper, receiving from 285c to 332c/kg. Medium weight feeder heifers lifted 13c and made from 260c and 285c/kg. Heavy weights eased 4c to average 286c/kg. Trade cattle gained 10c, with the heavy weights receiving from 288c to 302c/kg.

Heavy 3 and 4 score cows made from 206c to 252c, with the prime heavy weights averaging 244c/kg."
"Numbers lifted slightly in a more mixed winter yarding. There was a good selection of milk vealers, while yearlings included a larger percentage of secondary drafts more suited to restock. Grown steers showed good weight and finish, while cows were more mixed in condition and yield.

It was a mixed market, with quality reflected in variations. The better vealers averaged 7c to 13c dearer, with the best steers to slaughter making from 190c to 213c, while heifers sold from 160c to 201c/kg.

"Numbers lifted and there was a good supply of vealers and yearlings and most of them were sold to feeders. Grown steers and bullocks were well supplied but heifers were in limited numbers.

"Numbers lifted and the quality was mostly good. Feeders were active on most of the young cattle and there were heavy weight feeders offered. Trade cattle were again kept limited with feeders after most grades. Grown steers and bullocks were in reasonable numbers and competition was not as strong. Cows were in fewer numbers and the quality was plainer. All the usual buyers were operating in a cheaper market.

Light restocking vealer steers reached 400c/kg. The best of the trade veal made to 365c/kg. Feeder steers eased 5c on the plainer run of heavy weights and the better covered heavy weights fell 14c/kg. Medium weights were back 12c/kg as were the medium weight feeder heifers. Steers sold from 312c to 361c and heifers 300c to 327c/kg on the medium weights. Heavy trade steers were 14c cheaper ranging from 308c to 326c and heavy heifers lost 6c making from 290c to 325c/kg.

"Numbers lifted and the quality was mixed. Yearlings made up the bulk of the offering but there was an increase in the number of vealers and weaners penned. Prime grown cattle were limited with a large number lacking weight and finish. Around 500 cows were penned. Not all the usual buyers were operating in a varying market.

Light restocking weaners were 6c dearer with the steers selling from 355c to 436c and the heifers reaching 370c/kg. Trade vealers were slightly cheaper receiving 340c to 366c/kg. Feeder steers averaged firm to 4c cheaper but on breed and quality the market was stronger. Steers sold from 336c to 382c/kg. Heifers to feed were firm ranging from 305c to 350c/kg.

"Numbers lifted and the quality was mixed with all weights and grades represented.  The majority of the yearling cattle penned presented in store condition, with only limited prime cattle to suit the trade offered. Grown steers were in greater numbers than the previous week, and there were a reasonable quality of grown heifers yarded. Cow numbers declined, however quality held throughout the yarding, with prices mostly lifting from last sale. Not all of the usual buyers were in attendance, with a major feedlot order not operating. Restocker orders were active in their bidding, competing strongly against the feeders on the lighter secondary lines of cattle. Overall the feeder cattle trended cheaper than last sale, with the quality pens of restocker cattle selling to a similar trend from last week.

Yearling steers in prime condition sold between 360c to 390c/kg. Feeder steers sold to easier competition, trading from 360c to 410c/kg. Restockers had fight to secure the better bred cattle, with prices ranging between 350c to 466c. Yearling heifers in prime condition were in short supply, and sold from 335c to 380c/kg.

"Numbers eased and the quality slipped. Yearlings to feed on were best supplied and trade cattle were limited. Young cattle to restockers were in short supply and competition was weaker. Grown steers and bullocks were also in fewer numbers and the quality was a lot plainer. Around 540 head of mostly medium weights cows were penned to the usual group of buyers with the return of all the feeder orders. Trade cattle were cheaper with the exception of trade heifers.

"Numbers eased and quality remained similar to the last market. There were a fair percentage of vealers together with good numbers of yearlings with the majority selling to lot feeder orders. Limited numbers of grown steers were penned and the cow yarding was reduced compared to the last sale.

Most young cattle sold at dearer levels with medium weight vealer steers returning to the paddock ranging from 184c to 197c/kg. The vealer heifers selling to restockers and the trade improved 6c/kg.

"Numbers eased and quality remained mixed with very few prime conditioned cattle yarded. Fair percentages of vealers and yearlings were offered, while the grown steers and heifers were limited in supply. Cows were mixed in quality with around 500 yarded and the market trend overall was cheaper.

"In a similar sized yarding , the market stalled as buyers offered considerably reduced price levels compared to previous sales. While there were bursts of bidding across yearling steer categories, the prerequisite was that the steers had to be very well-bred. Not all buyers were operating at the sale with some major processors and feedlots present but not operating.
 
The absence of a major player in the feeder steer market at the sale led to a downward trend in prices. Feeder steers underwent a price correction of 10c to 15c/kg, particularly affecting the medium weights and they ranged from 310c to 382kg. Feeder heifers encountered difficulties in attracting feedlot buyers, slipping by 15c to 20c/kg and selling between 220c and 310c/kg. Trade cattle remained limited and domestic processors were not prepared to chase the sale and were valued between 268c and 351c/kg. Restockers displayed some interest across lightweight categories, but at lower levels. The lighter weights selling from 300c to 350c/kg.
 
In the export market, competition was very patchy, leading to a decrease in prices particularly for heavy heifers with good finish and shape. Heavy steers  and bullocks were sold between 290c and 350c/kg, while heavy heifers ranged from 240c to 238c/kg. Heavy cows were in short supply, with most big cows lacking fat cover. Prices experienced a 10c to 15c/kg decline, selling between 210c and 241c/kg. Leaner types sold at 120c to 205c/kg.

Some southern processors failed to compete in the competition, with cheaper trends evident in the older steers, heifers and cow categories.

The younger steers and heifers lost little in the competition compared to the last cheaper market. Medium weight yearling steers, to lot feeder orders, averaged 6c higher, although the top end sold at similar prices, to reach 184c/kg. Heavy weights suitable for the butchers also remained firm. Yearling heifers selling to butchers and processors, showed little change in price, to range from 134c to 160c/kg.

The absence of southern processor competition ensured the heavy weight grown steers lost 10c to 12c/kg, however quality also contributed in places. The heifer portion slipped 2c, before reaching 151c/kg. Cows struggled in the competition to ease 4c to 8c/kg.

Heavy grown steers suitable for slaughter were limited in number while fair percentages of grown heifers and cows were offered.

Medium weight yearling steers to lot feeders lifted 4c partially due to an improvement in quality to range from 169c to 189c/kg. The heavyweights to the trade remained firm in value. The yearling heifers to lot feeders lost 2c as the heavyweights to trade buyers slipped 4c/kg.

Grown steers to lot feeders remained firm, while quality issues caused the heavyweights to slaughter to slip 1c to 3c/kg. Grown heifers selling to processors lost 2c as the best reached 160c/kg.

Cows showed little change as lightweights to southern agents reached 126c/kg. The plainer D2 pens to processors averaged 113c, while the better finished D3 and D4 lots ranged from 115c to 128c/kg. Heavy bulls sold at similar rates as the best reached 150c/kg."
"Consignments halved mainly due to the shorter working week and quality remained mixed. Vealer numbers lifted as an increased supply of yearling steers and heifers were penned. Heavy steers were limited in supply, while the older heifers also reduced in number. There were around 230 cows offered to fewer export buyers present.

Both vealer and yearling steers returning to the paddock and to lot feeder orders sold 1c to 2c either side of firm as the medium weight yearlings ranged from 174c to 193c/kg. Yearling heifers also to feeders struggled to maintain firm prices and lost 8c, reaching a maximum price of 169c/kg.

Heavy weight grown steers to slaughter sold to limited processor competition and eased from 6c to 10c, while heifers lost 9c/kg. Cows also sold to a reduced field of buyers and slipped from 9c to 13c/kg. The plainer 2 scores averaged 100c, while 3 and 4 scores ranged from 110c to 125c/kg. The best heavy weight bull topped at 146c/kg."

Heavy weight vealer steers to the butcher orders remained firm and ranged from 190c to 212c, as the B muscles reached 214c/kg. Yearling steers weighing over 400kg sold to lot feeders at prices close to firm, averaging 200c after topping at 205c/kg. The prime conditioned heavy weights suitable for the butchers and processors also sold firm and averaged 197c/kg. Yearling heifers suitable for feeder orders, together with the heavier weights to the trade, both sold to dearer trends.

Heavy weight grown steers to slaughter gained 5c to range from 180c to 207c, as the majority sold around the 196c to 203c/kg range, depending on age and finish.

The best heavy weight bull topped at 199c/kg."
"Consignments eased compared to the last market, however still remained high and quality was mixed. Vealers were limited, as good runs of yearling steers were yarded, with the majority suitable for the lot feeders. Fair numbers of yearling heifers were penned, with most weights and grades represented. Grown steers and heifers declined in number, week-on week, while the cows were well supplied. The northern and southern export processors failed to compete, causing these categories to sell at substantial lower prices.

The 200+kg vealer heifers to the processors lost 8c, to average close to 150c/kg. Yearling steers to lot feeders were the high light of the market, as these trended 8c to 9c/kg dearer. Prices for the medium weights ranged from 164c to 194c, as the heavy weights reached 193.2c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed and restocker purchases struggled in the competition and lost 7c to 10c/kg.

Light and medium weight yearling steers to restockers and lot feeders improved 5c as the sought after breeds reached 236c/kg. Heavy weights sold at similar values with those to trade buyers reaching 227c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to lot feeders lifted 4c with the best reaching 208c, while the heavy weights to the trade remained firm to sell from 185c to 214c/kg.

Cows continued the dearer trend to lift 3c to 8c as the plainer D2 pens averaged 136c/kg. The better finished 3 and 4 scores ranged from 135c to 163c/kg. The best heavy weight bull reached 180c an improvement of 5c/kg."
"Consignments eased and quality was also marginally lower compared to the last market. Percentage wise the younger drafts together with the older steers and cows were well supplied and the market trend was cheaper.

Vealer steers returning to the paddock eased around 15c with quality and breed contributing in places, to range from 182c to 208c/kg. The same weight heifer portion to restockers remained firm as those selling to trade orders lost 6c/kg. The heavy weights to the trade also found the competition tougher in places. Medium weight yearling steers to feeders lost 7c/kg with trade buyers also discounting the heavy weights although quality was also not to the standard of the previous market. Yearling heifers to feeders and the trade eased 6c to 10c/kg.

The better end of the grown steers to feeders eased 4c/kg, however the plainer lines suffered greater price losses. Heavy weight steers to slaughter sold a few cents either side of firm depending on age and finish as the best reached 185c/kg. Grown heifer remained firm.

Cows sold at similar rates as the plainer D2 pens averaged 131c/kg. The better finished D3 and D4 cows ranged from 130c to 149c as the C muscles reached 151c/kg."
"Consignments eased and quality remained mixed with some unfinished younger cattle together with some prime conditioned pens available in the market. Vealers were scarce as fair runs of yearlings were yarded. Grown steers were limited as around 350 cows were offered. Usual buyers competed as the market remained firm to dearer.

Any prime well-muscled younger steers and heifers selling to butcher orders sold at a premium as prices topped at 219c/kg.

"Consignments eased and quality remained fair to good. The younger drafts were well represented with a fair yarding of grown steers also offered. Compared to the last market cow numbers improved percentage wise and the usual buying orders competed.

Vealer steers and heifers gained 4c as the yearling steers to lot feeders and restockers improved 2c to 3c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to butchers gained 4c/kg with supply limited. Yearling heifers to lot feeders and restockers lifted 3c to 5c to sell from 194c to 200c/kg. Heavy weights to the trade sold at firm prices to range from 184c to 212c/kg.

Grown steers found the competition weaker as those too lot feeders slipped back 5c/kg, while those selling to the processors also eased. Heavy weights to slaughter ranged from 185c to 205c/kg. The best of the heifers topped at 192c/kg. Cows remained similar in price although some were better quality and higher yielding. Plainer 2 scores averaged 135c as the better finished 3 and 4 scores ranged from 138c to 158c/kg."
"Consignments eased and quality also slipped week-on-week. There were pens of well-bred good quality cattle mixed throughout the market and these sold well, however any plainer lots, especially the younger heifers, struggled in the competition. An extra supermarket order returned to the market and on average price trends were cheaper. A single donated vealer heifer sold for a charity raised over $27,000. 

Vealer steers weighing over 200kg returning to the paddock lost 20c/kg, however breed and quality contributed in places. The same weight heifer portion to the processors slipped 14c to sell from 145c to 165c/kg.

Heavy weight bull remained firm and reached 182c/kg."
"Consignments are starting to return to normal levels after the Christmas holiday for a fair to good quality offering of cattle. Vealers were scarce, while good numbers of yearling heifers were penned. Fair numbers of grown steers and heifers together with a handy yarding of cows were offered in a dearer market.

Yearling steers to lot feeders gained 10c to 14c, while the yearling heifers also selling to lot feeder orders improved 14c to 15c/kg. The yearling heifers suitable for the trade buyers lifted 8c to 12c as the best reached 190c/kg.

"Cattle numbers were slightly reduced and the quality was not as good, with only a limited supply of prime cattle. Secondary lines of yearling were well supplied and there was a decrease in the number of steers offered. Grown steers and bullocks were again in short supply. Cow numbers increased but the quality was not as good. Not all the usual buyers operated in a mostly firm to dearer market.

Restocking vealer steers lifted 8c to reach 360c/kg. Medium weight vealers to processors gained 2c, selling from 311c to 332c/kg. Trade yearlings were unchanged with the steers ranging from 322c to 354c and the heifer portion returning 300c to 329c/kg.

"Cattle numbers were back and the quality remained mixed, but there were some very good crop finished and supplementary fed yearlings penned. Yearlings were best supplied and there was a better offering of 2 and 4 tooth heifers. Grown steers were limited, and only 90 cows were penned. The usual buyers were present but not all operated in the dearer market.

"Cattle numbers slipped back and quality overall was plainer than the previous market, however there were some prime conditioned pens spread throughout the sale. Fair numbers of vealers and yearlings were offered while the heavy grown steers and heifers were limited in supply. Good percentages of cows were yarded and two extra buying orders from the south competed.

Vealer heifers showed little change except for some quality issues as the best medium weights to the trade averaged 154c, while the heavy drafts reached 193c/kg. Yearling steers to feed and the restockers improved 3c to 6c/kg, while the heavy pens to slaughter lost value with fewer of the better end offered compared to the last market. The better C muscled yearling heifers to feed gained 1c to 2c/kg as an extra feeder buyer pushed the competition stronger, however any to the trade struggled with quality issues affecting values.

"Cattle numbers lifted and the quality was mixed with a lot more individual lots. There were some very good yearlings and cows penned, while trade cattle and heavy grown steers, and heifers remain very limited in numbers. There was extra competition on cows with the return of a northern buyer. The market sold to a consistently stronger trend.

Weaner steers to restockers sold from 400c to 500c, and heifers reached 430c/kg. Yearling steers to feed were overall dearer with the more popular bred lines to feed making from 380c to 410c and secondary lines from 355c to 385c/kg. Most heifers to feed sold from 340c to 383c/kg.

"Cattle numbers eased and the quality was plainer, with more cattle in lighter condition. Yearlings were best supplied and there was a limited run of prime grown steers and heifers. Approximately 350 cows were offered and not all the usual feeder orders were operating and there was an extra cow buyer. Young cattle to feed and restock sold to cheaper trends, while cattle with weight and condition sold to stronger trends to processors.

"Cattle numbers dropped and the quality varied from drafts of heavy trade vealers and good lines of trade yearling and good numbers of feeder cattle. Grown steers were limited in supply and cow numbers halved. All the usual buyers operated in a firm to dearer market.

Vealers to the trade sold 8c to 9c better, ranging from 270c to 325c and light restocking lines sold up to 362c/kg. Trade steers were 5c to 7c dearer on the medium and heavy weights while quality affected the medium weight heifers which sold to a cheaper trend and the heavy weights remained firm. Steers ranged from 280c to 310c and the heifers sold from 272c to 305c/kg. Feeder steers gained 3c to 7c, receiving 270c to 327c/kg. Heifers ranged from 285c to 306c, lifting 5c/kg on the heavy weights.

Grown steers and bullocks averaged 6c dearer on a limited run and sold up to 295c/kg. Cows improved 10c to 12c on most weights and grades with the medium weight 2 score cows ranging from 190c to 226c/kg. The better covered 3 and 4 scores sold from 216c to 245c to average 228c/kg."
"Cattle numbers decreased and quality was mixed but did contain good numbers of well finished cattle. Yearlings were well supplied and there was a very mixed selection of aged steers. Around 200 cows were also penned to a larger field of buyers but not all operated.

Medium weight vealers were stronger and sold from 170c to 215c/kg. Light weight steers returning to the paddock or going to onto feed fell 14c to 20c and the heifers were back 6c to 8c/kg. Yearling steers to feed eased 2c to 3c ranging from 155c to 187c and those to the trade gained 7c/kg on the heavy weights and remained unchanged on the medium weights. Prices ranged from 170c to 202c/kg. The heifer portion slipped 5c to 6c, ranging from 148c to 185c with light weights to 190c/kg.

Medium weight grown steers remained steady ranging from 172c to 192c, to average 185c/kg. Cows lost 12c to 16c/kg, with not all processors operating. Medium weight 2 score cows sold from 80c to 115c and the heavy 3 and 4 score cows sold from 110c to 145c/kg."
"Cattle numbers decreased and quality varied. Vealers were still in reasonable numbers but there was an increase in the number of light plainer weaner steers. Yearlings continue to be well supplied and there were more plainer steers with 2 or more teeth. Finished grown steers and heifers were in good numbers and there were plenty of medium weight cows. Not all the usual buying orders were operating in a mainly dearer market.

Vealers remained firm for the heavy and medium weights to the trade selling from 160c to 211.6c/kg. The trade yearling steers and heifers gained 1c to 4c with the steers ranging from 165c to 195.2c averaging 184c/kg. The heifers sold between 142c and 174c/kg. Feeder steers went against the dearer trend easing 3c on the heavy weights and 10c on the medium weights. Prices ranged from 150c to 178c averaging 165c/kg.

The better finished grown steers were firm selling from 160c to 186.2c averaging 180c/kg. Lighter weights to feed made from 150c to 178c/kg. Cows were 3c to 4c stronger with the 2 scores 70c to 100c and the 3 and 4 scores 90c to 128c/kg."
"Carcoar penned 228 less cattle than last sale resulting in an offering of 1029 mixed quality cattle. These numbers included good lines of medium and heavy weight feeder steers and heifers as well as good pens of heavy cows. All the regular buyers attended to a variable market with lines of better bred heifers to suit restockers slightly dearer and odd sales of forward medium feeder steers stronger. It was also a processor market with pens of yearling slaughter cattle 330c to 430c/kg. 

Light yearling steers to feed sold mostly to firm trends with the secondary types cheaper. The better types of medium weight feeder steers were slightly dearer but cheaper on an overall trend. The very heavy feeder steers to feed were included in the yearling feeders still having their two teeth. Limited drafts of heifers to the restockers saw slightly dearer trends although plainer types saw mostly a firm to cheaper trend. As with the steer portion the heavy heifers were included in the yearling feeders as they still held their two teeth. 

Heavy grown processor steers were cheaper the odd heifer sale slightly dearer. The overall cow market saw a cheaper trend with the top of the cows to 328c/kg. The bull market sold larger numbers with interest in feeder bulls to 539c/kg and the heavy processor bulls to 311c/kg.

Market Operator Stephen Adams."
"Carcoar penned 1856 generally good quality cattle with the usual buying panel attending. Trends were varied with cows selling to much dearer trends. Heavy well finished processor cattle also selling to a dearer market. Feeder cattle well supplied and demand was strong.

Light yearling steers to feed 290c to 378c/kg.The better drafts of medium feeders were dearer with the average trends firm 270c to 400c/kg. Heavy feeder steers saw a slightly dearer trend. Heavy yearling steers to process sold to 363c/kg and similar weight heifers selling slightly dearer 329c to 340c/kg. Light background heifers made 340c/kg and medium feeders firm 280c to 360c/kg although plainer drafts affected the overall average. The heavy yearling categories to feed sold 280c to 340c/kg.

Heavy grown heifers were dearer selling to 354c/kg. Cows were dearer throughout the medium weights 140c to 290c/kg. Heavy cows significantly dearer up 30c to 40c/kg in places and selling to 293c/kg.

"Carcoar penned 1357 head which was a decrease of 373 from last weekâ€™s offering. It was a good  quality offering made up of heavy cows and a good selection of yearling cattle to suit the feeder buyers. The usual operators attended to a generally dearer market.

Limited vealers sold to dearer trends to processors as did the well finished yearling cattle. Light yearling steers sold to considerably dearer trends to feeder interests. The same result with the medium weight steers with an emphasis on the better bred types. Heavy steers to feed sold to a dearer trend with heavy yearling steers to process also dearer. Heifers sold to similar trends with the better presented drafts selling firm to dearer for both light and medium weights. 

Strong competition for heavy weight grown steers saw the limited numbers dearer and the same applied for the grown heifers. Cows sold to dearer trends with high yielding heavy cows selling to 338c/kg. 

Market Operator Stephen Adams"
"Carcoar numbers reduced slightly to 962 good quality cattle for the last sale of 2022. It was a penning of good numbers of feeder steers particularly the heavy category and an offering of heavy cows. The regular buyers attended to a market of dearer trends.

Limited numbers of light steers were available to restockers. Medium feeder steers sold to 505c/kg while the heavy drafts were 11c/kg better. Processor steers also sold to strong demand. Yearling heifers sold to dearer trends throughout. Light restockers were considerably dearer to feed and the medium weights were up to 10c/kg better.

Heavy grown steers sold to dearer trends as did the heifer portion. The cow market took to strong trends especially the heavy cows which were up to 15c/kg better. Heavy bulls sold to 300c/kg and there was demand for numbers of yearling bulls to feed on.

Market Operator Stephen Adams."
"As the weather remains dry the numbers keep rolling in with the yarding lifting by 475 head. It was a good quality yarding with large numbers of ideal feeder cattle, along with a good choice of prime young cattle. Once again there was good numbers of cows penned, and only limited numbers of well finished grown steers and heifers. Not all the regular buyers were operating with a major northern export processor absent from the buying panel.

Young cattle to the trade were a little dearer with prime steer yearlings making from 280c to 297c, while the prime heifer yearlings sold to 275c/kg. Young feeder cattle were 4c to 8c dearer, with the feeder steers making from 250c to 319c, while the feeder heifers sold from 230c to 282c/kg. Young cattle to restockers finished dearer for the younger calves, and 2c to 5c/kg cheaper for the older cattle. The young restocker steers sold from 253c to 300c, while the young restocker heifers sold from 200c to 265c/kg.

There were too few grown steers to quote. Grown heifers were 6c cheaper, with the better  classes making from 211c to 253c/kg. Cows were 22c cheaper, with the 1 and 2 scores making from 50c to 165c/kg. The better 3 and 4 scores sold from 150c to 225c, with the prime heavy weight cows averaging 208c/kg. Bulls were considerably cheaper making to 240c/kg."
"As the weather remains dry the next selloff commenced, with numbers increasing by 640 head. It was an overall good quality yarding, with good numbers of ideal feeder cattle along with a fair selection of trade cattle. Cows and grown heifers were well supplied and there was only limited numbers of grown steers. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance and operating.

Young cattle to the trade were 5c cheaper, with the prime steer yearlings selling from 304c to 329c, while the prime heifer yearlings sold from 285c to 305c/kg. Feeder steers were from 3c to 5c/kg dearer, while the feeder heifers were firm. The feeder steers sold from 269c to 344c, while the feeder heifers sold from 238c to 311c/kg. Young cattle to the restockers were firm with the steers selling from 248c to 322c, while the young restocker heifers sold from 210c to 273c/kg. 

Grown steers were firm with the prime medium weights selling from 290c to 333c/kg. Grown heifers were also close to firm, with the better types selling from 278c to 313c/kg. Cows were from 5c to 8c cheaper, with the 2 scores selling from 130c to 202c/kg. The better 3 and 4 scores sold from 200c to 276c, with the prime heavy weights averaging 254c/kg. Bulls sold to 279c/kg."
"As the seasonal conditions remain tough, numbers lifted and quality was mixed. There were good runs of yearlings, together with a fair penning of grown steers and heifers. Cows were well supplied, with around 800 yarded and there were percentages consigned as units with calves and these were split and sold separately. The usual buyers competed and competition was solid throughout most categories.

Calves struggled to attract competition and sold at very affordable prices. Yearling steers to lot feeder and restocker orders sold close enough to firm, as the heavier weights to the butchers also sold at similar prices week-on-week. Yearling heifers on average lifted 7c, as those to the feeders ranged from 132c to 160c, while the heavier weights to the butchers averaged 160.5c/kg.

Grown steers to slaughter sold to solid northern and southern processor competition and gained from 2c to 5c/kg. The heavy weights ranged from 170c to 184c/kg depending on age and finish. The heifer portion improved 10c to 12c/kg however age and quality contributed in places. Cows also sold to strong southern and northern competition to sell firm to 5c/kg dearer. The plainer D2 medium weights averaged 120c, as the better finished 3 and 4 scores ranged from 117c to 150c/kg. The best heavy weight bull reached 170c/kg."
"As the majority of producers were disappointed with the rainfall result measured around the supply area, together with another spell of hot weather forecast, numbers lifted and quality remained mixed. Fair numbers of vealers, along with a good supply of yearlings were penned, as the majority sold to lot feeder orders. Grown steers were limited and there was another good penning of cows. One southern processor order failed to compete.

Medium weight vealer heifers to the processors remained firm in price. Yearling steers to lot feeder orders trended much the same as the previous market, however the lighter weights were lower in quality. Medium weights ranged from 147c to 179c, as the heavy weights averaged 166c/kg. Yearling heifers struggled to remain firm and slipped 3c/kg.

Grown steers to slaughter, struggled with the loss of the southern order, to slip 3c to 5c, as the best younger drafts reached 165c, with most sales around the 156c/kg range. The heifer portion trended dearer. Due to the cancelling of the Monday markets, cows were sought after by the processors and gained 10c to 11c/kg. The plainer D2 cows averaged 89c, as the better finished 3 and 4 scores ranged from 80c to 122c/kg. Heavy weight bulls gained 12c/kg, to top at 167c/kg."
"As the dry weather continues the selloff continues. Once again here were large numbers of cows and young calves throughout. The best of the cows were in good condition though there were large numbers of very plain cows. There was a fair selection of feeder steers and a limited selection of prime trade cattle and grown steers.

The few young cattle to the trade were close to firm with vealers selling to 309c and the prime yearlings to 303c/kg. Feeder steers and heifers were firm to 2c/kg cheaper. Feeder steers sold from 246c to 303c while the feeder heifers sold from 200c to 271c/kg. Young restocker cattle were up to 40c/kg cheaper with some lots passed in. Young steers to the restockers sold from 180c to 250c to average 221c while the young heifers to the restockers sold from 106c to 228c/kg.

The few grown steers were 4c cheaper with the prime medium and heavy weights selling from 240c to 275c/kg. Grown heifers sold to 263c/kg. Plain conditioned cows were up to 25c/kg cheaper while the prime heavy weights were firm. 2 score cows sold from 40c to 156c while the better 3 and 4 scores sold from 142c to 223c with the prime heavy weights averaging 205c/kg. Bulls sold to 232c/kg."
"As the dry weather continues the numbers keep rolling in, lifting by 600 head. Cows made up the bulk of the yarding, along with good numbers of young cattle to suit both the feeders and processors. Grown heifers were well supplied and there were very few grown steers.

Young cattle to the trade were 8c to 15c cheaper, with the prime yearlings making from 200c to 274c/kg. The very best of the feeder steers and heifers were firm, the balance though were 12c to 15c/kg cheaper. Feeder steers sold from 230c to 289c, while the feeder heifers made from 150c to 246c/kg. Young cattle to the restockers were cheaper again, with the young steers receiving from 120c to 260c, while the young heifers sold to 229c/kg.

There were too few grown steers to quote. Grown heifers were 25c cheaper, with the better types making from 180c to 246c/kg. Cows were 20c to 28c/kg cheaper. 2 score cows sold from 60c to 138c, while the 3 and 4 score cows made from 121c to 185c, with the prime heavy weights averaging 173c/kg. Bulls sold to 220c/kg."
"As the dry weather continues numbers continue to come. Cows with their young calves made up a large percentage of the yarding, cow represented a third of the yarding as growers continue to offload. There were a few good trade cattle and grown heifers yarded and no grown steers.

Vealers to the trade were firm while the yearlings were 8c/kg cheaper. Vealers sold to 322c while the prime yearlings sold from 260c to 310c/kg. Feeders were firm with the feeder steers selling from 259c to 304c while the feeder heifers sold from 240c to 285c/kg.

Grown heifers were a little dearer with the better types selling from 235c to 270c/kg. Cows were 2c to 4c dearer with the 2 scores selling from 110c to 182c/kg. The better 3 and 4 scores sold from 182c to 223c with the prime heavy weights averaging 209c/kg. Bulls sold to 252c/kg."
"As the dry conditions continue numbers continue to increase, with the yarding lifting by 2,000 head. Once again there were large numbers of cows and young calves mostly lacking finish. There was a better selection of well finished grown steers but very limited numbers of properly finished trade cattle.

The few young cattle to the trade were close to firm with vealers selling to 310c and the prime yearlings selling to 300c/kg. Feeder steers were 6c to 10c dearer while the feeder heifers were up to 14c/kg cheaper compared to the previous sales very strong market. The feeder steers sold from 250c to 304c while the feeder heifers sold from 240c to 270c/kg. Young cattle to the restockers were 25c to 35c cheaper with the young steers selling to 278c and the heifers reaching 236c/kg.

Grown steers were 10c dearer, with the prime medium weights selling from 263c to 279c/kg. Grown heifers sold to 238c/kg.

"As markets return to normal following the Easter and ANZAC holiday weekends, number lifted for a good quality offering of cattle. Younger cattle were well supplied, as greater percentages of prime conditioned pens were yarded. Grown steers lifted in number with some carrying plenty of weight. Cows were well represented and the usual buyers competed in a firm to cheaper market.

The 200kg+ vealer steers selling to restockers sold to a dearer trend, although quality contributed in places, as prices ranged from 208c to 223c, and up to 225c/kg for the heavier weights. The same weight heifer portion struggled to maintain firm prices and lost 9c/kg, as all classes slipped compared to the dearer previous market. Heavy weight vealers to the butchers averaged 198c to 214c, after reaching 229.6c/kg. Yearling steers to lot feeders remained firm, as the medium weights ranged from 188c to 225c, while the well-bred prime conditioned heavy weights to the same orders reached 228.2c/kg, with quality improving compared to the last market. Yearling heifers to lot feeders slipped 4c/kg. Prime heavy weight heifer to the butchers gained 4c, and sold from 185c to 223c/kg.

Heavy weight grown steers to slaughter sold to solid competition, however failed to reach the high prices attained at the previous sale. The better finished pens ranged from 197c to 211c/kg. The heifer portion also lifted in finish as the seasonal conditions improve and gained 6c, to range from 175c to 197c/kg. Cows struggled to remain firm and lost from 6c to 10c/kg. The plainer 2 scores averaged 116c, as the better finished 3 and 4 scores sold from 122c to 160c/kg. Heavy weight bulls also struggled in the competition and slipped 4c to 5c/kg."
"As good follow up rainfall fell in the supply area over the weekend break, numbers eased and quality lifted with greater numbers of the younger heifers in the market suitable for the trade. Vealers were scarce while only fair numbers of yearling steers were yarded. Grown steers, the older heifers and cows were well represented with some high yielding lots yarded. The usual buyers competed.

The medium weighted vealer steers returning to the paddock gained 10c to 12c, while the yearling steers to lot feeders improved 4c to 6c/kg in value. Yearling heifers to the trade lifted 5c to 8c to range from 175c to 210c/kg.

Quality issues lifted values for the grown steers as medium weights improved 2c while the heavyweights gained as much as 10c/kg. The better finished heavyweights to slaughter ranged from 179c to 215c/kg depending on age and condition. Export heifers showed little change as the best reached 189c/kg. 

Cows remained firm to 4c dearer with lightweights selling to restockers reaching 147c/kg. The better finished medium and heavyweight cows to processors ranged from 148c to 175c/kg. Bulls maintained their firm values as the best heavyweight reached 188c/kg."
"As conditions remain dry the numbers continue to come forward. It was a typical drought yarding with large numbers of cows, many of which were in very plain condition along with large numbers of calves. There were a few well finished pens of trade cattle and only limited numbers of grown steers.

Young cattle to the trade were around firm with vealers selling to 308c and the prime yearlings selling from 256c to 304c/kg. The feeder steers were close to firm, while the feeders were 12c to 16c/kg cheaper. The feeder steers sold from 248c to 304c, while the feeder heifers sold from 224c to 249c/kg. Young cattle to the restockers were cheaper with the steers selling to 275c and the young heifers to 230c/kg.

The better 3 and 4 score cows sold from 135c to 209c, with the prime heavy weights averaging 192c/kg. Bulls sold to 252c/kg."
"Another plain offering of cattle was yarded and numbers slipped back as the surrounding area received substantial rainfall over the weekend. Vealers were scarce, while fair numbers of yearlings were offered. Grown steers and heifers lifted in number compared to the last market however numbers still remain quiet low. The cow yarding remained around the same and the usual buyers competed in a dearer market.

Medium weight vealer steers selling to restockers remained firm while the same weighted heifer portion slipped in quality and struggled to remain firm. Yearling steers selling to restockers, the trade and lot feeders gained 5c to 7c as the heifer portion lifted 6c to 8c/kg.

Grown steers lifted 10c to 13c with the medium weights ranging from 180c to 215c as the few heavyweights reached 219c/kg. Heifers also sold well and improved 7c as the best to exporters reached 192c/kg. Cows continue to improve with the majority lifting 6c to 7c/kg. The plainer D2 lots ranged from 145c to 153c as the better covered D3 and D4 pens reached 175c/kg. Heavy bulls gained 5c with the best muscled lot reaching 209c, as most sold around the 183c/kg range."
"Another large consignment of generally fair to good quality cattle was offered to the usual buyers, however one lot feeder failed to attend. Younger cattle were well supplied as good numbers of grown steers and heifers were penned. Cows were well represented with most weights and grades yarded. Competition was weaker with most categories slipping from 4c to 12c/kg.

Vealer steers to restockers sold up to 12c/kg cheaper as heavy weight vealers to the butchers also slipped back in price. Light and medium weight yearling steers to lot feeders and restockers lost 2c to 10c/kg, however heavy weights to the feeders remained similar in price. Yearling heifers sold cheaper to ease 5c to 6c, as heavy weights to the trade reached 190c/kg.

Grown steers to lot feeders eased 5c/kg. Heavy weight steers to slaughter defied the cheaper trend to remain firm as the best reached 200.2c/kg. Grown heifers eased back 4c as the best averaged 167c/kg. Cows continued the cheaper trend to slip from 3c to 9c as the plainer 2 scores averaged 118c/kg. The better finished 3 and 4 scores ranged from 118c to 152c/kg. Heavy bulls also sold cheaper with the top A muscle making 168c/kg."
"An increase in numbers did not slow the rising price trends of the past weeks as good numbers of vealers were offered. Yearlings made up the majority of the offering which was supported by good numbers of grown cattle and a large quantity of medium and heavy cows. Quality was reasonable throughout the sale but secondary lines were evident across most categories. All the usual buyers were active in the dearer market.

Vealer steers to feed rose 15c for the medium weights and those to the trade lifted 2c to 5c, as those purchased by feeders made from 168c to 205c, while those to the trade sold from 172c to 200c/kg. The vealer heifer portion gained similar rates with feeders ranging from 155c to 184c/kg. Yearling steers to processors lifted 3c to 4c and while medium weights feeders were generally firm. Lightweight feeder steers average 179c, while medium weights sold closer to 182c, and heavy weight averaged 1871c/kg. The small number of medium weights to slaughter topped at 194.2c to average 191c/kg. Lightweight yearling heifers sold around 166c as the medium weight mostly made around 179c/kg. Medium weight to slaughter reached a topped of 206.2c to average around 179c/kg. 

Grown steers and bullocks were 4c to 7c stronger with heavyweights averaging from 156c to 172c and bullocks making from 156c to 173c/kg. The few grown heifers also sold to a dearer trend as good lines to slaughter reached 166c/kg. 

Medium and heavy cows dominated the cow offering, as medium weight 2 score cows gained 3c and ranged from 116c to 128c/kg. Heavy 3 and 4 scores sold from 129c to 142c with most sales around 135c/kg. Top of the heavy bulls reached 160c/kg."
"Although the supply area remains dry, cheaper prices restricted cattle numbers and quality remained mixed. Yearling steers and heifers were well supplied, as fair numbers of the older steers and heifers were penned. Cows were well represented, with around 700 offered. The younger cattle to feeder orders sold to solid competition, as export processors were scarce, however there was one southern export processor returning to the competition.

Vealer steers returning to the paddock, sold to cheaper trends, as the same weight heifer portion to the processors remained firm week-on-week. The light and medium weight yearling steers to lot feeder orders lifted 6c to 10c/kg, as greater gains were recorded for the heavy weights to the same orders. Prices ranged from 130c to 179c/kg. Yearling heifers trended 2c to 3c dearer, with those selling to the lot feeders ranging from 120c to 137c/kg. Heavy weights to the butchers sold from 124c to 168c/kg.

Heavy weight grown steers to slaughter enjoyed southern processor competition and gained 2c to 7c/kg. The heifer portion improved 5c/kg. Cows again struggled in the competition, although the plainer D2 cows remained firm to a shade dearer. The better covered D3 and D4 cows lost 4c to 9c, to sell from 85c to 112c/kg. Bulls also trended cheaper."
"Although numbers lifted compared to the last market consignments still remained quiet small for a mixed quality offering of cattle. Vealers were scarce, while percentage wise the yearling heifers were well represented. Grown steers suitable for slaughter were limited while a fair yarding of cows was penned.

Medium weight vealer steers returning to the paddock remained firm, while the light and medium weight yearling steers to lot feeders sold firm to 3c/kg dearer. The heavyweight yearling steers selling to trade orders improved 5c as the best reached 187c/kg. The yearling heifers purchased by lot feeders and the trade lifted 3c to 5c with those selling to the trade ranging from 150c to 188c/kg.

Heavy grown steers to slaughter improved 8c/kg with quality improving compared to the last market. Grown heifers gained 3c as the best reached 165c/kg. 

Cows continue to sell at solid rates to lift 3c to 4c, with the better finished D3 and D4 pens ranging from 125c to 138c, as the C muscles reached 140c/kg. The heavy bulls improved in value as the best reached 162c/kg."
"Although consignments slipped compared to the last markets record numbers, they still remained high and quality was mixed. There were fair runs of yearlings, while grown steers were reduced in number. Cows were again well supplied with the majority originating from the local area. The full field of buyers competed, as most categories sold at firm prices, however cows enjoyed greater restocker and processor competition.

Yearling steers to the lot feeders sold 1c to 2c either side of firm, as the medium weights ranged from 142c to 180c/kg. Yearling heifers showed little change, however the lighter weights were represented with the better quality and popular breeds, which contributed to price improvements.

Heavy grown steers suitable for slaughter also sold at similar prices to sell from 152c to 170c/kg. The better covered heifer portion remained firm, as the best topped at 145c/kg. Cows enjoyed price gains from 6c to 10c/kg. The lighter D1 pens selling to the restockers lifted 10c to average 90c/kg.

Heavy weight bulls lifted 3c, as the tops reached 166c/kg."
"Although consignments failed to reach the high numbers recorded at the previous market, they remained substantial and quality was fair to good. There were the usual percentages of plain younger cattle spread throughout the market, and some of these struggled to attract solid competition. Vealers were in limited supply, however fair numbers of yearlings were penned. Grown steers and heifers, together with the cow categories, were well supplied and the usual buyers competed in a dearer market.

Yearling steers selling to lot feeder and restocker orders lifted 8c to 11c/kg, as the northern orders again entered the competition. The medium weights ranged from 170c to 194c/kg. The yearling heifers also trended dearer by 1c to 4c, as the heavy weights to the butchers reached 170c/kg.

Export cattle enjoyed strong southern and northern processor competition, as the heavy weight grown steers to slaughter lifted by 5c to 7c/kg. The prime conditioned pens ranged from 176c to 192c/kg. The heifer portion again sold to solid competition to gain 5c, as the best reached 175c/kg. Cows continued the dearer trend, as the southern and northern processors were keen to secure numbers. The plainer 2 scores averaged 123c, while the better covered 3 and 4 scores ranged from 132c to 162c/kg. Heavy weight bulls maintained firm prices to top at 174c/kg."
"along with a pretty good selection of well finished trade cattle. There were a few pens of well finished grown steers and heifers and there was not the number of cows compared to previous sales. A full field of buyers were in attendance and operating in a reasonably solid market.

"Agents offered a similar yarding although quality and condition was a little more mixed. There were some very good runs of yearlings offered with a fair number of vealers in smaller lots. Cows and grown steers in mostly good condition were well represented. 

The market varied to average firm to around 5c/kg dearer for young cattle and grown steers. Cows averaged 5c/kg cheaper.

"After recent rainfall, feed levels have been boosted and numbers continue to slip and quality remained mixed. Percentage wise the younger cattle were well supplied, as grown steers were limited in number. There were nearly 400 cows offered a sharp decrease compared to recent markets. The usual buyers competed in a dearer market.

Medium weight vealer steers returning to the paddock gained 16c, to sell from 168c to 198c/kg. The same weight heifer portion lifted around the same in price.

Well-muscled pens to butchers reached 210c/kg. The yearling heifers to feeder orders improved 9c to 12c, selling from 143c to 178c, as the best to the trade reached 211c/kg.

Heavy weight grown steers to slaughter lifted 7c, ranging from 170c to 184, as the heifer portion gained much the same to reach 165c/kg. Cows continued the dearer trend, as restockers competed for the lighter end, as well as the better bred heavier weights. The plainer D2 cows to processors lifted 9c, to average 120c, with the better covered 3 and 4 scores improving 6c, to reach 144c/kg. The best to the restockers topped at 147c/kg."
"A smaller yarding produced strong competition from the usual gallery of buyers with the greater percentages of the younger pens suitable for restockers and lot feeders. Grown steers were scarce and there were few heifers yarded. Fair percentages of cows were offered and quality was mixed with plainer lots together with some over conditioned drafts. 

Medium weight vealer steers returning to the paddock gained 10c to range from 174c to 209c/kg. The heifer portion remained firm as those to lot feeders and restockers averaged 169c to 170c/kg. Yearling steers to the trade showed strong gains to reach 209c, while the heavyweights to lot feeders and slaughter improved 4c to range from 180c to 187c/kg.

The few grown steers sold around firm with medium weights ranging from 180c to 189c, while the heavyweights reached 190c/kg. The older heifers remained around firm. Cows lifted 2c to 3c as the plainer D2 pens averaged 125c, while the better covered medium and heavyweights ranged from 126c to 148c/kg. The few heavy bulls remained firm to reach 146c/kg."
"A slight increase in the numbers did not affect the quality of the cattle. Prime yearlings were well supplied and there were ample numbers suitable for the feeder orders. Grown steers and bullocks were back in numbers but there was a larger selection of heavy cows. Vealers were limited. All the usual buyers were operating in a dearer market.

"A slight decrease in numbers and the quality was mixed. There were some large runs of yearling steers, mostly suiting feeder orders, with a limited supply to suit the processors. There were some good lines of well finished grown steers and heifers, along with almost 600 cows.  Young cattle to suit the restockers lacked the quality of previous sales. Most of the usual buyers were operating. 

Heavy prime yearling steers were dearer, selling from 490c to 568c and the yearling heifers to process were also dearer, making from 430c to 561c/kg.

"A larger yarding was offered to the usual buyers and quality was mixed with large percentages unfinished and suitable lots for feedlotters and restockers. Fair numbers of vealers were yarded while the yearlings, especially the heifer portion were well represented. The grown steers and heifers were well supplied and there was a good yarding of cows in the market.

Light and medium weight vealer steers returning to the paddock remained firm as plain lightweights reached 227c, while the average recorded for the sale was 204c/kg.

Numbers lifted and the quality was mixed with all weights and grades represented.  A large percentage of the yearling cattle penned presented in store condition, which attracted the attention of the feeder buyers and restockers.  Grown steers were in greater numbers than the previous week, and there were also reasonable numbers of grown heifers yarded. There was also a lift in the numbers of cows penned, however quality varied throughout the yarding.  All of the usual buyers were in attendance however a large export order did not operate.  Restockers were active in their bidding, competing strongly against the feeders on the secondary lines of cattle.  Overall the feeder cattle trended dearer, pushing trade buyers out of the market.
