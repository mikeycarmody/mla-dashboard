Commentary
"Numbers increased to 974 cattle to boost supply by 25pc on a week ago. There was bigger lines available, particularly in the grown heifers and steer sections to suit feedlots. The market trend was generally firm to dearer, although there was still a selective tone to bidding and there was some young cattle there were judged to be softer in places. The positive was the return of two export orders that have been absent in recent weeks although they really didnâ€™t impact results only buying limited numbers.  Not quite half the yarding was cows and the best pens showing plenty of weight and condition were firm, however the plainer mid and third run of cows were sometimes a few cents easier.

The pick of the grain fed yearlings sold to 398c/kg and the better types of young steers and heifers to the trade were generally in the range of 360c to 390c/kg. Underneath this was a lot of sales from 310c to 370c for heifers and steers selling to a mix of processors, feedlot orders and the regular restocking interest from the south and Victoria. Secondary animals and odd lots of a couple of head 250c to 280c/kg.

Quality improved in the grown steer section which helped support prices to a top of 393c/kg for hard finished heavy steers to processors. Feedlots paid from 350c to 384c/kg for steers with frame and weight, while competition for feeder heifers was more robust at a top of 375c/kg to average 356c/kg over the main run.

In the cow run exporters consistently paid from 310c to 330c/kg for penlots of heavy cows in prime score 3 and 4 condition, just a few sales higher to a top of 338c/kg. Where the market showed a little more variance was on the mid-run of cows with less fat cover and yield, prices varying from 240c to 290c/kg for most.

Note: this is a preliminary report and subject to change.
