Commentary
"Widespread rain over the past fortnight resulted in a smaller yarding of 565 cattle. The mixed quality consisted of some good pens of heavy cows, supported by several small lines of store steers and heifers.  Demand was solid throughout with three regular processors operating, supported by two live exporters, one central backgrounder along with opportunity traders and local restockers. Cattle were drawn from Richmond and east to the local area.

A small sample of suitably weaned steers returning to grass averaged 310c selling to 318c, similar heifers to backgrounders made to 288c/kg. Yearling steers above 330kg to live export reached 301c, most selling from 266c to 288c/kg. Yearling heifers above 280kg to restockers reached 268c to average 265c, processor types sold to 258c to average 233c/kg.

A small offering of grown steers to live export sold to 292c to average 288c,  well finished steers to processors averaged 286c/kg. Heavy grown heifers to processors reached 256c to average 254c/ kg.

A very small sample of heavy bullocks to processors topped at 300c to average 293c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows  made to 238c to average 221c to 229c and prime heavyweight cows also reached 238c to average 237c/kg.  Heavy bulls to processors averaged 272c/kg.
