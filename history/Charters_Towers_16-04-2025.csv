Commentary
"Yardings increased to 1,888 head at Charters Towers this week, with a large gallery of buyers present and active. An excellent draft of big lines of northern prime cows and bullocks were supported by a good draft of store cattle, resulting in an increase in values across all categories on last sale. All regular buyers were in attendance, accompanied by two live export buyers, a southern meatworks buyer and central store buyer. Cattle were drawn from Burketown, Normanton, Richmond, Pentland, Cape River, Woodstock, local and coastal areas.  

Greater supply of vealer steers were keenly contested within the buying gallery, with many lines pushing values above last sale, topping at 320c/kg.  A large line of northern yearling steers attracted strong interest among western restockers, selling consistently above 265c, to top at 300c/kg. Vealer heifers were of mixed quality, however, sold strongly to several restockers, to top at 274c, with many pens selling above 245c/kg.  Yearling heifers were dominated by one larger line of northern bred cattle which sold to 254c/kg, mainly to a central feeder buyer.

An excellent selection of 3 score bullocks attracted strong buyer interest, selling strongly throughout to both live export and processor buyers, to top at 264c, while 2 score bullocks sold to 258c/kg to live export. A larger yarding of 3 score cows to slaughter increased by 9 to 13c on last sale, topping at 213c, with 2 score cows similar, selling to 202c, and averaging 188c/kg. Cows to restockers sold to 179c, with many lines selling from 165 to 172c/kg. Prime heifers were well supplied and sold to higher rates to top at 240c for slaughter types, while heifers to restockers sold to 205c and averaged 196c/kg. Heavy slaughter bulls sold to a top of 219c, while live export buying increased values for medium weight bulls, topping at 246c/kg. A small number of cows and calves sold to $950/unit."
"With the local district still suffering from the dry seasonal conditions, numbers remained relatively similar to the last sale. Contained in the market were 338 store and 105 prime cattle. Generally there was a slight improvement in quality; however there was very few large lines presented for sale. With only one major processor and several local butchers and restockers operating, prices suffered the same fate as other markets averaging on a cheaper trend.

The majority of the grown steers were under 400kg, and they sold to a top of 131.2c to average at 123.4c, which was 5c/kg cheaper. Medium and heavy weights sold to 135c, while bullocks reached 135.2c/kg.

Grown heifers were of 2 and 3 score and averaged in the early 110c/kg mark. Cows were generally of lightweight with 2 scores topping at 116.2c and 3 scores at 121.2c/kg. There were only a couple of bulls and they reached 105.2c/kg."
"With the last sale two weeks ago numbers lifted greatly for a plainer yarding of cattle. The largest percentages by far were the cow categories with most weights and grades represented. Steers were only represented with fair numbers with the heifer portion very scarce in the pens. All the regular buyers competed.

Steers were mainly medium weights with the better quality drafts trading from 147.2c to 163.2c/kg. Heavy pens sold from 149.2c to 158.2c with most sales around the 155.7c/kg.

Cows were mainly light and medium weights with only a few pens of heavies yarded. The better quality lightweights sold from 89.2c to 126.2c/kg. Medium and heavy pens traded from 100.2c to 135.2c/kg. Bulls mainly held their firm prices with the best topping at 132.2c/kg."
"With the absence of further rain events and public holidays, Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents yarded 1,731 cattle this week, the largest yarding in over 6 weeks as the mustering season begins. The offering of cows was quite good with some very good heavy and extra heavy cows on offer along with some very good quality bullocks, while store cattle were of mixed quality with some good lines on offer. Two regular processors and feeder buyers were absent, however the processors in attendance were selective in their participation, as was the sparing gallery of restockers and backgrounders. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Forasyth, Greenvale, Tully, Ingham, Mingela, Balfes Creek, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were generally good quality however met limited buyer interest, topping at 298c for lighter types to average 280c, while young steer calves sold to 304c/kg. With the absence of live export feeder orders, the demand for yearling steers was absent. Yearling steers comprised of several small lines and considerable variation in quality, with better bred 280-330kg lines selling to 284c for those returning to grass, while those above 330kg sold to 262c/kg. Vealer heifers were generally good quality and also met limited buyer demand. Light vealer heifers affected by dry conditions sold to 196c, while better grown vealers to grass sold to 254c to average 217c/kg. Yearling heifers sold firm on the recent intermittent sales topping at 224c for those of joinable weight, while lighter types returning to grass sold to 222c, averaging 219c/kg. Grown heifers to slaughter sold to 246c, averaging 239c, up by nearly 20c/kg on the last notable sale.

A very mixed consignment of bullocks sold according to quality with best 3 score heavy bullocks to slaughter topping at 266c, to average 261c, with lighter 2 score bullocks reaching 259c/kg. Several small lines of 2 score bullocks returned to grass for 241c, while one live exporter secured suitable bullocks to 251c/kg. Heavy grown steers to slaughter sold to 261c, with some very good crossbred types returning to grass for 251c/kg. The increased supply of good heavy cows met subdued demand from processors, with the best extra heavy 3 and 4 score cows topping at 217c/kg. Heavy C muscled 3 score cows to processors made to 215c, easing by up to 14c to average 207c, and D muscled heavy 3 score cows sold to 210c to average 198c/kg. Heavy C muscled 2 score cows also to slaughter topped at 205c to average 196c/kg and D muscled cows of similar weight average 181c, with medium weight averaging 165c/kg. Several small lines to restockers sold to 151c to average 135c/kg. A good supply of bulls met keen competition, with heavy bulls to live export selling to 269c, with most sales above 260c, while a small number to slaughter sold to 256c/kg. A southern backgrounder paid to 263c for lighter 2 score bulls, while light weight males to restockers sold to 248c/kg. One very good line of young cows and calves sold to $1,225/unit."
"With temperatures falling, numbers fell by more than 900 for a total yarding of 1592 head for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, with quality across all lines showing more variability. Reduced numbers of heavy prime cattle saw prices ease by 2 to 4c for cows, while bullocks lifted 1 to 2c/kg. One major processor was absent this week, with all other regular processors, feeder buyers and restockers active throughout the sale along with one live exporter.

A similar number of vealer steers to last sale attracted mixed buyer interest selling to 380c/kg for lighter weights. One large line of northern yearling steers attracted strong interest, with most sold to feed, to 318c/kg, for an average of 298c, while lighter weight steers returning to grass sold to 354c/kg. A good line of heavier yearling steers returning to grass sold to 325c/kg. Steers destined for live export sold to 296c, to average 286c/kg. A small number of vealer heifers was on offer with values easing 10 to 14c, topping at 290c/kg, with quality and weight variable. Yearling heifers were of mixed quality and condition with one large northern line attracting strong interest from both feeders and restockers. Heifers to feed sold to 276c to average 265c/kg, while those above 280 kg returning to grass sold to 274c, to average 263c/kg.

A small number of bullocks of variable quality and weight sold to mixed demand with bullocks to live export sold from 285c to 281c/kg, and bullocks of lesser quality and weight to feed destined for live export made to 272c/kg. Some grown steers to live export sold to 295c/kg. A very mixed quality yarding of cows saw values ease, particularly lower yielding heavy cows, 3 score cows sold to 240c, to average 218c, while heavy 2 score cows sold to 217c, to average 204c/kg. Lighter 1 and 2 score cows to slaughter lifted 3 to 7c, topping at 205c, to average 186c/kg. Bulls maintained the trend of recent strong sales, with heavy bulls to slaughter topping at 266c to average 261c, while heavy bulls destined for live export sold to 286c, with sales mainly falling between 274 and 279c/kg. Medium weight bulls to feed destined for live export sold to 318c, to average 292c/kg. One very good line of cows and calves sold for $1720/unit."
"With some useful rain across many areas and the forecast of further rain, numbers increased by more than 900 for a yarding of 2495 cattle.  Quality was mixed, comprising of some large northern lines, an increased supply of heavy bullocks and cows, supported by several mixed lines of store steers and heifers. All regular processors were in attendance and operating at stronger rates, along with one feeder and opportunity feeders, backgrounders and restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Normanton, Georgetown, Prairie, local and coastal areas.

Increased demand saw solid gains for heavy, better quality processor types with grown steers and heifers to processors lifting 20-40c, cows averaged 11-26c better, heavy bulls improved 15c to 20c/kg.

Limited numbers of young steers to restockers sold to 266c to average 246c, similar heifers to processors made to 240c to average 234c/kg. Yearling steers were of mixed quality and sold accordingly. Steers above 280kg to feed reached 262c to average 225c, while steers above 330kg sold to 292c to average 250c to 279c/kg. Yearling heifers above 200kg to processors sold to 252c, averaging 233c, while a good sample above 280kg to processors averaged 232c/kg.

"With some light rain around, numbers fell by 145 head to 1223 cattle. Quality was mixed, comprising of some good lines of prime cows and feeder steers, supported by many small mixed quality lines. All regular processors operated at stronger rates, supported by one live exporter and several opportunity feeder operators. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Normanton, Coen, and south to the local area.

"With rain and storms forecast across much of the north in coming days, 2,806 cattle were penned in a combined Prime and Store Sale. Quality was very good with some large lines of local grown steers and bullocks along with some good small lines of heavy prime cows. Several younger store lines showed the effect of the dry season. The regular buyer panel was in attendance and operated at stronger rates on many lines. Grown steers were firm to 10c dearer, bullocks eased up to 10c, heavy cows to processors were firm to 7c dearer and bulls improved by up to 20c/kg.

"With no sale last week due to insufficient numbers, agents this week penned 1046 cattle.  Quality was good for most lines with some very secondary types in the bulls.  Only three regular processors were operating, supported by most regular feeders, one live exporter and some enthusiastic restockers.  Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Georgetown and south to the Belyando.

Light steers and heifers improved 17c to 23c on the back of active restockers, yearling heifers to feed improved 20c to 35c, heavy bullocks lifted 3c and prime cows averaged 3c lower.

Grown heifers sold to 130c/kg, while cows under 400kg reached a top of 130.2c/kg. Medium weight bulls sold to 138.2c/kg."
"With much of the industry focussed on Beef Week, the supply of cattle reduced significantly on last week, with 1122 cattle penned in a combined prime and store sale. Quality was variable with a smaller offering of heavy prime cattle, however there were some good lines of store steers and heifers.  Buyer representation was limited to two processors, one live exporter and opportunity feeders, backgrounders and restockers.  Cattle were drawn from as far west as Boulia to Mt Isa, Normanton Georgetown and the local area.

The limited demand saw values ease across most categories, with quality a factor, however prime lightweight cows, and best quality store steers improved by 10c to 16c on last sale. 

Best quality yearling steers above 280kg returning to the paddock averaged 221c, selling to 284c, steers above 330kg averaged 276c/kg. Steers above 330kg to feed averaged 234c/kg. A limited supply of yearling heifers sold relative to quality - a small sample above 330kg to the trade made 208c/kg.

"With isolated storms in the region and many producers hanging onto the forecast for rain, numbers fell dramatically to 393 cattle for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week. Prime cattle contributed to the majority of the yarding, with store cattle too few to quote. Three of the four major processors were in attendance and operating, while the remainder of the buying gallery were restockers and onlookers. Cattle were drawn from Greenvale, Ingham, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

Vealers were absent from this week's sale and there were insufficient heifers to quote. Some yearling steers sold to 298c/kg to restockers. Some good lines of mostly well finished 3 score bullocks to slaughter sold to 255c/kg.

Grown steers 2 and 3 score attracted strong restocker interest, selling to 267c, to average 260c/kg. Well finished 3 score cows sold to slaughter and topped at 216c/kg, averaging 211c, while 2 score cows to slaughter sold to 197c, to average 191c/kg. The small number of bulls to slaughter sold to 230c/kg. A small number of cows and calves sold to $1,400/unit."
"With isolated storms across the north and local area and the potential of further rain in the coming week, numbers declined by more than 1,300 head for a yarding of 520 cattle for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, comprising of mostly store steers and heifers. The absence of significant lines of cattle were a factor in the reduced offering, along with a recent contraction of values across many classes of cattle. The lack of prime cattle only saw one processor operating, however the return of one feeder buyer accompanied by local restockers and backgrounders ensured most store values were firm to dearer on last sale. Cattle comprised of one line of northern steers, with several smaller lines on offer. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Einasleigh, Townsville, Mt Coolon and local areas. Light weight vealer steers to restockers improved 5c on last week, while similar light weight yearling steers to restockers eased  by 11c/kg. Yearling steers over 280kg to restockers eased 8c, however similar steers to feed increased up to 27c/kg, with most destined for live export. Yearling steers over 330kg returning to paddock sold firm, to average 258c/kg. Light weight heifers increased up to 8c, while a selection of better quality yearling heifers to feed improved by more than 35c/kg on last sale. A limited offering of heavy 2 score cows to processing sold firm on the previous fortnight, while 2 score cows to restockers sold firm on last sale. 

Light vealer steers sold to 280c, to average 271c, while the heavier types averaged 263c/kg. Light yearling steers to restockers topped at 266c, to average 250c, while steers over 280kg averaged 246c, with similar steers to feed averaging 237c/kg. Steers over 330kg returning to grass sold to 266c, to average 258c/kg. Young light weight heifers returning to the paddock sold to 224c, to average 197c, while better bred lines of yearling heifers to feed made to 216c, to average 175c/kg. 

A single pen of heavy 2 score bullocks made 232c/kg. Grown heifers to processors sold to 151c, and heifers to feed sold to 138c/kg. Heavy 2 score cows to processors made to 162c, averaging 157c, while lighter 2 score cows to restockers averaged 154c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export sold to 238c/kg, while good conditioned cows with weanable calves sold to $1,020/unit."
"With cool temperatures and rain in the local area, 340 excellent quality prime cattle were offered at the annual Northern Beef Expo Cattle Show and Sale in Charters Towers. Two regular processors and three live exporters operated at increase rates on many lines of high yielding prime bullocks, cows and domestic steers and heifers. Cattle were drawn from Torrens Ck, Mt Surprise, Bowen, Belyando and local areas. Several lines of young cattle were not offered for auction.

A small number of steers calves for sale improved 5c and heavy milk tooth steers and heavy yearling steers to live export improved by up to 25c/kg on regular weekly rates.

Yearling heifers to slaughter reached 255c to average 243c/kg. Heavy bullocks to processors made to 289c multiple times, while grown steers to live export made to 294c to average 290c/kg. Extra heavy 3 score cows sold to 193c to average 187c, and 4 score cows sold to 190c to average 188c/kg."
"With around 25mm of rain in most of the supply area, a smaller yarding was offered. All the regular buyers were present and active Quality was similar to previous sales with a handful of good steers and bullocks included in the line up. 

Most of the light steers averaged around 112.3c after selling to 120.2c as the plainer lines averaged from 89.8c to 97.5c/kg. The better medium weights reached 143.2c as a large number of heavy steers averaged 147.1c/kg. The top of the heavy bullocks made to 154.2c/kg. 

Light export heifers made to 118c as the E2s averaged 86.3c/kg. A fair number of light and medium weight cows were offered. Light D2s sold to 102.2c as leaner lines averaged 85.1c/kg. Good medium weights reached 112.2c/kg."
"With an uncertain wet season and delayed start to the year, a yarding of 1,332 cattle were drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, with some good lines of bullocks, cows and store cattle on offer.  One of the major processors was notably absent, along with a seasonal processor and regular feeder buyers, while restockers were intermittent and a buyer for live export was present. Reduced values were seen across most classes, compared to the final sale of 2016, particularly in the prime cows.

Some very good vealer steers sold to strong demand, particularly lighter types, topping at 388c/kg, with most sales around 370c, and heavier types averaged 352c/kg. Yearling steers sold to 364c to restockers, averaging 345c, while steers to a live export backgrounder sold to 324c, averaging 316c/kg. Vealer heifers were of mixed quality and sold strongly to restockers to top at 352c, averaging 343c, while yearling heifers sold to 302c to average 298c/kg.

Mixed numbers of cows and calves sold to $1,440/unit."
"With agents undecided if a sale will be held next week, a much smaller yarding was offered. Quality was generally plain with only a handful of finished steers offered. Scattered storms across the supply area have been well received with further falls forecast for the coming days provide hope for many producers. Cattle were drawn from the local areas as well as a mixed draft from the Northern Territory. 

Medium weight C3 steers in small numbers averaged 173.2c after selling to 174.2c/kg. The plainer D2s averaged 142.4c/kg. Most cows offered were leaner 2 scores with lightweights averaging 128.7c and medium weights averaging 133.7c/kg. Young light cows topped at 150.2c/kg. For the size of the yarding, a fair number of bulls were offered with lean medium weights averaging 121c/kg."
"With a poor seasonal outlook, numbers increased on previous sale to 2,825 cattle for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, with good numbers of well finished bullocks and cows being presented. With one major processor absent, competition for processor cattle was strong throughout, with prices easing in line with processor grids. Buyers in the store section were represented by a couple of feeder buyers and backgrounders for live export, supported by several restockers, albeit at lower values than previous sale. Cattle were drawn from Prairie, Mt Garnet, Innisfail, Ingham, Ayr, Ravenswood, Belyando, Balfes Creek, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers showed signs of the light season averaging 8c lower to a top of 364c/kg. Yearling steers returning to paddocks sold to 341c, to average 324c/kg.

"Widespread storm rain across much of the north and west resulted in a large decrease in the supply of cattle to 654 head, 1973 fewer than last sale.  Quality was very mixed, with only a few pens of genuine heavy prime cattle, while store steers and heifers consisted of several small lines. Only one processor was in attendance with all regular processors and feeder buyers absent due to the small yarding. Opportunity local feeders and restockers were the most active at reduced rates.  Cattle consisted of far western cattle held prior to the rain event, supported by several small local lines.

Good quality lightweight steers sold to 564.2c to averaging 423c to 456c and similar heifers to opportunity restockers made to 402.2c to average 360c/kg.  A small sample of good quality yearling steers to feed averaged 348c reaching to 356c, while a small selection of yearling heifers returning to the paddock sold to 326c to average 273c/kg.

Limited numbers of grown steers to feed destined for live export sold to 346.2c to average 336c to 346c/kg.  There were insufficient grown heifers to reliably quote.  Single bullock sales made to 322c/kg.  A small selection of prime cows to processors made to 290.2c to average  273c/kg.

"Widespread rain over the past fortnight resulted in a smaller yarding of 565 cattle. The mixed quality consisted of some good pens of heavy cows, supported by several small lines of store steers and heifers.  Demand was solid throughout with three regular processors operating, supported by two live exporters, one central backgrounder along with opportunity traders and local restockers. Cattle were drawn from Richmond and east to the local area.

A small sample of suitably weaned steers returning to grass averaged 310c selling to 318c, similar heifers to backgrounders made to 288c/kg.

"Widespread rain across the region over the past week impacted supply with 2204 cattle yarded, 1926 fewer than last sale.  Quality was mixed with two large lines of northern pastoral cattle, supported by small lines of prime cows and some good quality young steers and heifers.  A reduced number of processors were present and operating, however feeder, backgrounder and restocker buyers were active throughout the sale.  Cattle were drawn from vast northern and western regions, local and coastal areas.  Grown steers and heifers improved 9-17c, prime cows lifted 10-12c and heavy bulls increased by 9c/kg.

Light steer calves to restockers sold to 552.2c with mixed sexes averaging 487c, while heifer calves to the trade sold for 422c/kg.  Good quality vealer steer returning to the paddock reached 487c to average 432-464c and heifers to the trade reached 404c to average 361-391c/kg.  A small sample of yearling steers to live export reached 400c, steers below 280kg to backgrounders topped at 420.2c to average 411c and steers above 330kg to feed reached 416.2c to average above 408c/kg.

"Widespread rain across the north and west reduced numbers by more than 750 in a combined prime and store sale with 686 cattle penned. Quality was very mixed, featuring three lines of northern cattle and one from the southern part of the supply area. There were less than 200 cows penned with most cattle lacking weight and offered in plainer condition. The smaller buyer panel consisted of three regular processors and opportunity feeder operators with selective demand. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Normanton, Belyando, local and coastal areas. The smaller offering improved prices on most categories by 8c to 18c/kg.

A small offering of yearling steers above 200kg returning to the paddock sold to and averaged 238c, while yearling heifers above 280kg, sold to 202c multiple times with those to feed  averaging 197c and 194c/kg to the trade.

"Widespread rain across much of the north and west resulted in a large decrease in supply with 1869 cattle penned, 1251 fewer than last sale.  Quality was mixed with fewer prime cattle -mostly consisting of one large line of northern cows, along with some good quality store steers and heifers. A major road closure prevented one processor and opportunity restockers from attending, however there was strong competition for lighter cattle. Value changes were reflective of quality, with light steers improving by 30c to 40c, heifers increased by up to 30c while heavy cows to processors averaged 4c/kg higher.  Cattle were predominantly drawn from Normanton, Croydon, Cloncurry, Greenvale. 
 
Light steer calves to restockers sold to 738.2c while a good sample of vealer steers topped at 624.2c to average 602c/kg. Good quality vealer heifers to restockers sold to 580.2c to average 520c/kg. Yearling steers above 280kg to restockers reached 492.2c to average 423c to 492c and heavy yearling steers above 400kg to feed sold to and averaged 414c/kg.

"Widespread rain across much of the north and west resulted in a dramatic decrease in numbers to 690 cattle in a Combined Prime & Store sale. Quality was impacted by a large offering of northern pastoral cattle with only a limited number of prime cattle offered. Two regular processors were absent due to the smaller yarding while those in attendance, including opportunity restockers, operated at reduced rates in line with other sales across the state and the quality penned.

Cattle were mostly drawn from northern areas including, Burketown, Doomadgee, Georgetown and Ravenshoe. Yearling steers and heifers sold in line with quality, grown steers were mostly firm, cows to processors fell 8c and bulls averaged 14c easier.

Light weight steers returning to the paddock sold to 528.2c, to average 504c/kg. Better quality yearling steers above 200kg returning to the paddock sold to 465.2c to average 420c to 440c/kg. A limited number of grown steers above 400kg to feed sold to 406.2c to average 398c and suitable trade types also sold to 406.2c to average 365c/kg. A reduced number of heifers to feed sold to 316.2c with trade types making 326.2 c/kg.

A small sample of heavy well finished full-mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 355.2c to average 350c/kg. A much-reduced offering of cows met subdued demand. Medium weight 3 score cows to processors topped at 315.2c to average 308c/kg.  A small number of heavy bulls to feed sold to 316.2c to average 299c/kg.

The only pen of cows and calves sold for $1,500/unit.

"Vendor numbers were up, but overall cattle numbers were slightly lower. Quality was not up to previous weeks standard, with only the odd pen of better types. All the regular buyers were in attendance and operating however values for most suffered losses. 

All of the steers were plainer types with the only ones able to realise increased rates were the lightweights, which sold to 141.2c/kg. Both the medium and heavy steers reached 160.2c, as a limited number of heavy bullocks reached 162.2c/kg to return over $1,000/head. 

Going against the falling trend was the light heifers, which improved up to 5c/kg. The D3s reached 146.2c to average 141c/kg. The cows in large numbers also suffered falls. The lightweights reached 100.2c, as the mediumweight D3s averaged 124.9c/kg. 

The medium bulls were able to realise increased rates, as the heavy types topped at 149.2c/kg to remain firm."
"Values were mixed as a larger yarding was offered to a full panel of buyers, also operating was a new southern buyer. Even though increased numbers were presented the quality of the yarding was improved on previous weeks. The continuing dry and the current good rates were the main factors in producers offloading stock. 

A large number of steers suited to the Korean market reached 210.2c as an even greater number of heavy steers topped at 219.2c/kg to return over $1,200/head. The heavy bullocks were a relatively small percentage of the yarding with the strong competition pushing sales to 225.2c/kg. 

The heifers regained last weeks losses and improved further with most 10c/kg dearer. Over 150 light D3s reached 198.2c/kg. Most of the cows offered were medium weights, however the light D2s remained firm after selling to 170.2c/kg. Medium weight D3s topped at 199.2c/kg and returned over $1,000/head. 

Nearly all of the bulls offered were light weights selling to 168.2c, as a single heavy weight sold to 200c/kg."
"Useful rain in the local area saw numbers fall by around 200 for a yarding of 1745 cattle. Quality was mixed -with the supply of prime cattle halving on last week- however some good pens of well finished, heavy bullocks and cows were penned, supported by some very good quality store steers and heifers.  All regular processors were in attendance and operating, supported by one feeder, local opportunity restockers and backgrounders along with central backgrounders. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Georgetown, Hughenden, The Belyando and the local area.

Values lifted across most categories, particularly better quality lines. Yearling steers and heifers improved by 10c to 40c, prime grown steers, bullocks and cows averaged 6c to 35c better.

Very good quality weaned steers above 200kg to restockers sold to 320c to average 294c to 315c, lighter weights averaged 291c/kg. A good sample of lightweight heifers to backgrounders reached 236c to average 231c/kg. Yearling steers above 280kg to feed sold to 280c to average 273c, feeder types averaged 276c/kg. Steers above 330kg to feed reached 312c to average from 268c to 295c/kg. Yearling heifers above 280kg returning to the paddock sold to 236c to average 197c, heavy heifers above 400kg to processors made to 272c to average 271c/kg.

Grown steers above 400kg to feed sold to 312c to average 299c, heavy trade types made to 288c, most around 275c/kg. Good quality heavy grown heifers to the trade sold to 270c to average 248c, plainer types averaged 189c/kg.

Small lines of heavy 3 and 4 score bullocks to export slaughter topped at 292c, averaging from 276c to 286c/kg.

"There was slight decrease in supply and similar to others weeks quality dropped way quickly once of the top end of the market. All the regular buyers were in attendance and keen to purchase stock. Light steers sold from firm to 14c/kg dearer with the poorer quality stock realising the best gains. Medium steers gained from 4c to 7c/kg and there were too few heavy weights to provide an accurate quote. Heifers improved 14c to 16c while the cows were 2c to 10c/kg with the lesser finished grades the improving by the greatest margin. 

Light poor quality steers averaged 100c while the best grades made to 135c and averaged firm at 115.8c/kg. Good quality medium weight steers peaked at 160.2c and the C muscled cattle averaged from 146c to 158c/kg depending on finish. Poorer grades were in the largest supply and averaged 130c/kg. 

A small number of heifers topped at 135.2c/kg.  Over 180 light D1 cows averaged 82.2c while the better grades made to 113.2c/kg. Medium weight cows peaked at 123.2c and the D3s averaged 121.8c while the D2s saw most sales around 110c/kg. Poor quality medium weight bulls averaged 100c/kg."
"There was only a small supply available and an accurate trend is difficult to quote. There were some good heavy steers offered and these were 2c/kg dearer while the cows were mainly of lighter weight and received mixed results. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance and active.  

The light steers made to 117.2c and averaged 108.5c while the small number of medium weights topped at 138.2c and averaged around 125c/kg. The heavy steers came from the one vendor and they were of similar quality to the top steers of recent weeks. They topped at 144.2c and averaged 141.5c/kg.

The heifers reached 100c and averaged 86.5c/kg. The light cows topped at 105.2c and the better grades averaged 85.6c/kg. The medium weight cows were in limited supply and the D3s averaged 104.9c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 119.2c/kg."
"There was an increased yarding of 2,026 head consigned by Charters Towers Combined Agents. The yarding was drawn from northern gulf regions, Richmond, Woodstock, and Green Vale, local and coastal areas. It was a mixed quality yarding of plainer condition cattle, selling to a limited panel of buyers, with two processors not operating. The yarding was dominated by plainer steers, cleanskin bulls and mickeys. Limited numbers of cows and calves sold to $890/head. 

Calves to restockers were 11c dearer to average 261c/kg. Light weight vealer steers to the restockers eased 7c to average 248c, while vealer heifers were in good supply to top at 250c/kg, for a line of C4 heifers to slaughter.  Medium weight yearling steers to live export lifted 35c to average 256c, while heavier weight D4 lines settled on 251c/kg. Light weight D4 yearling heifers to slaughter were 6c higher on 197c/kg. 

Medium weight D4 manufacturing steers to slaughter were 20c cheaper on 243c/kg. Medium weight D4 cows to slaughter were 13c lower on 215c, while light weight bulls to feed were 12c cheaper on 185c/kg."
"There was an increased yarding of 1,823 head of cattle, 290 more than last sale despite only 191 prime cattle on offer. The sharp decline in prime values contributed to the decline, with no processors operating during the sale. Some large lines of store steers and heifers attracted a large gallery of buyers, with several western restockers and regular local backgrounders active throughout the sale, along with one live exporter. Quality throughout the sale was generally good, with many lines presenting in forward condition. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Greenvale, Ingham, Mt Coolon, local and coastal areas. Increased restocker activity improved values for better quality vealer steers by more than 8c, while a large sample of very good quality yearling steers increased by up to 70c/kg on last sale. Yearling steers over 280kg improved by up to 9c, while the presence of a live exporter saw suitable steers sell to 252c/kg. An increased supply of good quality heifers increased demand throughout.

"There was an increase of almost 900 head, to 2,450 cattle at Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week. Featured were some large lines of heavy prime cows and bullocks, mostly from the northern gulf, supported by some good quality store steers. All regular processors were operating at increased prices, with superior weight and yield on many lines. Two regular feeder buyers operated on many lines, particularly plainer types, supported by several restockers with an eye for better quality types. Cattle were drawn from Mount Isa, Burketown, Richmond, Corfield, Mount Garnet, Greenvale, Townsville, Home Hill, as well as local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were generally plainer than last sale and the lighter weights met limited demand. Better quality steers returning to grass sold to 276c, averaging 246c, while light steers calves made to 217c/kg, with variable quality on offer. Yearling steers to restockers eased 7c, topping at 248c to average 233c, while better quality medium weight steers to feed were 2c dearer making 230c/kg. A small offering of vealer heifers and calves sold according to quality, with one good line of vealer heifers making 206c, while the influence of the season saw very light heifer calves make 176c/kg. Most yearling heifers were also showing the effects of the season, with the majority destined for feed. Better quality medium weight heifers to feed eased 23c, topping at 231c to average 207c, while lighter types averaged 196c/kg.

There were 743 head of prime heavy weight bullocks seen, making this the largest offering in more than 3 years. This offering saw all export processors active throughout, lifting values by 2c to 4c/kg, with consistent improvements in weight and yield for many pens. Extra heavy bullocks to export slaughter reached 269c to average 262c, while heavy bullocks sold to 266c, improving 4c to average 257c/kg. Lower yielding heavy bullocks sold to 242c, while plainer medium weights to feed destined for live export sold to 234c to average 206c/kg.

An increased supply of plainer medium weight feeder bulls mostly sold to feed destined for live export, easing 8c to average 203c, while good quality suitable weaned males to feed made up to 226c to average 216c/kg. Light conditioned cows and calves sold up to $840/unit."
"There was an increase of 760 head to 2,057 cattle were presented by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents, featuring several good lines of prime cows and store steers.

Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Richmond, Forsayth, Einasleigh, Pentland, Ingham, Belyando local and coastal areas.

An increase in the number of vealer steers attracted strong competition lifting values for better quality types.

Grown steers also showed considerable variation in quality, with one line of heavy steers to feed selling for 229c/kg. The cow offering improved in number and quality with some very good extra heavy cows selling to 196c, and heavy 3 score cows sold to 195c to average 190c/kg.

"There was an increase of 696 head to 2,502 good quality cattle yarded by Charters Towers Combined Agents this week, which included some very good lines of well finished bullocks and cows in the prime section and several very good lines of store steers and heifers. Two regular processors were absent from the buying panel, reflecting on lower values across some prime categories, however regular feeder buyers and restocker jostled for dominance on store lines. Cattle were drawn from Chillagoe, Georgetown, Greenvale, Ingham, Woodstock, local and coastal areas.  

Vealer steers increased in numbers and set another saleyard record of 418.2c for light weights and regularly sold above 390c to average 392.6c/kg.

There were some good lines of well finished cows, store steers and young males were featured and sold to higher prices, with buyers active in the market. All processors were in attendance for the first time in several months, increasing prime cow prices by up to 20c/head, while one regular feeder buyer, two live exporters and several restockers were very active throughout the store section.

A mixed offering of cows and calves sold to $1,280/unit."
"There was an increase in supply but quality was of a lesser standard than previous weeks, particularly the steers. The good lines of stock that attracted the best rates last weeks were not present.  All the usual buyers were in attendance but competition was subdued. Steers were 10c to 11c/kg cheaper and heifers sold slightly easier. Lightweight cows gained ground while the medium weights were 4c to 7c/kg cheaper. 

Light steers reached 119.2c and averaged just under 116c/kg. The bulk of the steers offered were medium weights the better grades mostly sold around 131c while the lesser stock averaged close to 115c/kg. One pen of heavy steers sold to an isolated 144.2c/kg. A limited number of good quality heifers made to 134.2c and the majority were D2s that averaged 106.4c/kg. 

Light cows varied from poorer E muscled stock through to fair quality D2s. The bulk was of a better standard and peaked at 109.2c to average 98.3c/kg.  The largest number of medium weights were also D2s that averaged 103.3c while the D3s topped at 116.2c/kg. One pen of heavy D3s sold for 129.2c/kg. Bulls showed gains with most being heavy weights that averaged 98.2c/kg."
"There was a yarding of 1,764 cattle presented in Charters Towers, with quality generally good throughout. Some well presented lines of store steers and heifers met strong competition, while less than 600 prime cattle were on offer. Only three processors were in attendance along with regular feeder and backgrounder buyers, along with opportunity restockers and plenty of onlookers. Cattle were mostly drawn from local and coastal areas with some western lines. Prime cows and bullocks sold firm to 4c easier, while most store lines lifted by up to 20c/kg.

Steer calves returning to grass sold to 550.2c to average 477c/kg. Vealer steers returning to the paddock sold to 582.2c to average 493c and vealer heifers suitable for processors sold to 422.2c to average near 420c, while light heifers to feed averaged 368c/kg. Light yearling steers to restockers reached 450.2c to average 427c while yearling steers above 330kg to feed topped at 400.2c to average 395c/kg. A good supply of yearling heifers above 280kg to feed sold to 368.2c to average from 359c to 364c/kg.

Grown steers above 400kg to live export sold to 350.2c to average 336c and heavy bullocks to export slaughter sold for 356.2c/kg. Heavy grown heifers to the trade made to 348.2c to average 319c and heifers to feed sold to 355.2c to average 344c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows sold to 255.2c to average 246c and heavy 3 score cows topped at 270.2c to average 266c/kg. A small number of heavy bulls to live export sold to 352.2c, with young males returning to the paddocks selling to 482.2c/kg. A good selection of cows and calves sold from $1,300 to 1,625/unit."
"There was a very small penning that consisted mostly of heavy steers and medium weight cows. Most buyers were in attendance although not all were as active. Processors purchased the top cattle and competed with some butchers on the better lines. Steers were 4c and 5c dearer while the cows gained between 10c to 25c/kg.

The medium weight steers peaked at 150c/kg. The heavy steers sold to 155c and averaged 146.8c while most came from the one vendor. Heifers sold to 116.2c/kg.

Light cows sold to 110.2c and the D2s averaged 95.4c/kg. The medium weight cows peaked at 135.2c and the D3s averaged 129.5c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 133.2c/kg."
"There was a substantial decline in numbers and quality was fair to slightly plainer across most grades.  The yarding consisted of grown steers, bullock and cows with only a limited supply of heifers penned.  The regular panel of buyers was present and competition was firm to stronger across most categories.

The majority of the grown steers were light and medium weights and most were firm to slightly dearer while heavy pens were up to 6¢/kg dearer.  The well-finished C3 pens made from 157.2¢ to 159.2¢/kg.

Light weight cows were 1¢ to 4¢ dearer while the better medium weight lines rose by 4¢/kg.  The D3 medium weight pens averaged 131.1¢ and heavy 4 score cows sold up to 143.2¢/kg."
"There was a small prime penning for the first sale of the year although as store sale of 550 head was also held. The season has deteriorated over the break with feed and water becoming real issues for most producers. It has been reported that there is some good live export trade at present. The small yarding makes an accurate trend difficult to quote. 

Steers sold to 147.2c and heifers reached 129.2c/kg. Light cows were in the greatest numbers and topped at 110c with most around 90c/kg. Medium weight cows peaked at 110.2c and poor quality bulls made to 90c/kg."
"There was a slightly larger yarding consisting of approximately 600 prime and 2200 store cattle. The prime sale consisted of some excellent quality bullocks and cows, which sold to a dearer trend. A full compliment of buyers was present including one extra meatworks operator. 

Grown steers were of mostly good quality consisting of medium weight C muscled types. These ranged from 145.2c to 154.2c to average 149.8c/kg. Heifers sold to a slightly dearer market averaging 138.2c after reaching a top of 140.2c/kg. 

It was a good quality cow yarding containing some large runs of well-finished stock. Light and medium weight D muscled types averaged 132.4c and 136.1c respectively with the occasional pen making a top of 155.2c/kg. The best of the bulls sold for 124.2c/kg."
"There was a slightly larger yarding at Charters Towers today, made up mostly of export types. Steers were in good numbers and sold on a firm to dearer trend. 

Heifers also sold well with a large number of D3 types selling to a top of 147.2c, lifting 27c from last sale to average 140.1c/kg. The cows were the highlight of the sale with all grades selling from firm to dearer. The light and medium weight cows showed some good lifts with all D muscled types in particular improving strongly. Heavy cows were mostly firm on last sale.

A good yarding of bulls sold at irregular levels, with light bulls losing value but heavier types improving slightly."
"There was a slight increase in numbers and quality was plainer compared to the previous market.  The penning mainly consisted of grown steers and heifers along with a mixed selection of cows.  All the regular buyers were in attendance and competition was weaker across all grades.

The plainer offering of grown steers and bullocks eased by 2¢ to 6¢ and the C muscled heavy weight pens sold from 143.2¢ to 152.2¢/kg.  Grown heifers were 4¢ to 7¢ cheaper and the D2 lightweight lines averaged 112.2¢/kg.

Cows fell by 5¢ to 7¢/kg with odd isolated pens having greater price corrections.  The D2 lightweight cows averaged 112.7¢ while the D3 medium weight pens averaged 122¢/kg."
"There was a larger yarding of better quality that sold to the regular field of buyers. Local butchers bought a fair percentage of the yarding. Much of the local area is looking for rain with water availability becoming problem in some instances. 

There was a greater number of Jap ox weight steers available that improved in price as well as quality. The D3s topped at 186.2c to average 177.4c/kg. 

Export heifers sold at cheaper rates with a good run averaging 161.6c/kg. Cows were in the majority and lights weights eased. No accurate trend was available on the remaining grade following last weeks limited numbers, however medium and heavy weight D3s average around 132c/kg. 

Bulls lost ground and the best heavy weights sold to a top of 128.2c/kg to return close to $900/head."
"There was a large increase in supply following the stronger markets of recent weeks. The improved numbers saw a mixed quality yarding penned. All the regular buyers were in attendance and active, although competition was subdued on some of the poorer quality stock. A small number of light steers gained ground, while the medium and heavy weights eased by 2c to 7c/kg. Heifers were 3c to 6c cheaper and the cows varied 3c to 4c/kg either side of last weeks rates. 

Light steers topped at 134.2c and while the medium weights made to 143.2c the better grades averaged close to 140c/kg. The best heavy steers sold for 157.2c but most were of a lesser standard and averaged 144.6c/kg. Good quality heavy bullocks peaked at 159.2c/kg. There was some good heifers that reached 135c, with most making around 110c/kg. 

Light cows sold to 117.2c and close to 200 head averaged 110c/kg. There were some good lines of medium weight cows and these sold from firm to 3c dearer with the best grades making to 129.2c/kg. A large number of D2s averaged 115.5c/kg. All the bulls were of poor quality and sold from 50c to 96c/kg."
"There was a decrease in supply and quality was also of a lesser standard. Competition varied, processors were keen to purchase cows while the steers and heifers generally sold to weaker demand. The bulk of the steers eased 3c/kg. Heifers were cheaper and the light cows varied either side of last week. Medium weight cows improved 7c/kg. 

Light steers made to 132.2c/kg. Most of the steers were medium weights and they topped at 147.2c, although 120 head averaged just under 130c/kg. Heavy steers topped at 149.2c and averaged 148.8c/kg. The best heifers sold to 144.2c and a fair number averaged 116.6c/kg.

Light cows reached 113.2c and the D2s averaged 3c dearer at 106.5c/kg. Medium weight cows were well supplied and the sold to a top of 128.2c and close to 100 D3s averaged 124.7c/kg. One heavy cows topped at 129.2c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 95c to 100c/kg."
"The yarding was reduced and this combined with strong demand from export processors led to a very dear market. The four major processors operated throughout the sale with strong support for all grades of cattle with little dependence on quality. Additional support from butchers was evident but they had only limited opportunities to purchase better-finished cattle as processors secured most.

 A large line of 200 heavy steers from Cargoon north of Charter Towers was a feature of the sale selling to strong support, resulting in averages of 189.2c/kg. This accounted for a large percentage of the grown steers yarding but a smaller number of medium weights sold from 171.2c to 182.2c/kg. 

The strongest gains were reserved for the cow market with light and medium weights improving between 7c and 9c/kg. Surprisingly given the seasonal conditions many of the cows had good fat coverage which was welcomed by processors and led to the best lines selling to 175.2c/kg."
"The yarding of 422 prime cattle at Charters Towers on Thursday which was down by 334 head on last weeks sale.
  
In the export classes, light steers, D1 sold to 120.2c/kg for one pen.  A good sample of D3 medium weight steers topped at 125.6c to average 120.2c/kg.  Other heavier steers and ox reached 123.2c/kg.  D3 heifers reached 117.2c/kg.  

There was good numbers of cows penned, the better end of the heavy cows sold to 105.6c to average upwards of 100c/kg.  Bulls topped at 106.6c/kg."
"The yarding of 1,503 prime cattle at Charters Towers on Thursday represented a considerable rise of 907 head on last week.  

In the steers, light weight steers sold to 121.2c/kg, medium steers sold to 119.2c to average 107.4c/kg.  

Best of the heavy export steers reached 123.8c for a large sample of D3s with other heavier bullocks selling to 127.2c/kg.  A fair sample of D2s  heifers made to 125.2c/kg.  

The heavy cows that were offered sold up to 103.2c/kg to average 91.9c and bulls sold to 109.2c to be 3c/kg dearer."
"The yarding increased with just under 800 prime cattle offered. Quality was similar to the previous sale and appears to be declining in line with the season being experienced, with feedstocks in the local area deteriorating rapidly. Three regular buyers operated and purchases were generally shared.

Medium steers ranged from 140c to 150.2c while the heavy steers sold from 144c to 156c/kg, both weight grades experienced lifts in value. A large offering of grown heifers sold to varied competition with the best c muscled lines averaging 122.7c/kg.

The largest percentages of the cows were d3 medium weights; making up the bulk of these was a consistent line of six decks, purchased solely by one major processor. The best of the cows reached 136.2c while the overall average was 132.4c/kg. A smaller number of lighter conditioned cows averaged 119.2c/kg."
"The yarding improved, with the increase attributed to the beginning of the new financial year and continued decline in seasonal conditions. Not all buyers attended with one major exporter absent, this did not result in a weaker price trend with local butcher able to compensate for any weaker competition. 

Grown steer quality was quite good with plenty of competition for the better-finished lines, with medium weights averaging 147c, while heavier steers ranged from 165.2c to 169.2c/kg. Bullocks were in high demand and spirited bidding saw prices reach 173.2c, with the average at 169c/kg.

The quality of the cow yarding was quite varied with over 50% of the offering very good while the tail end was very light in condition and finish. Overall prices improved between 3c and 8c/kg for all weights and grades. Lightweights lifted 3c to average 122c while medium weight D3s dominated the yarding and ranged from 132.2c to 144.2c and the heavy conditioned lines averaged 149.2c/kg. A small number of heavyweights averaged 144c/kg."
"The yarding improved, with all the usual buyers in attendance and operating fully. Prices throughout the sale were erratic at times with the price trend towards the end of the sale significantly stronger as buyers battled to secure adequate supplies. The season in the surrounding region is heading backwards with much of the area in desperate need of rainfall leading into winter. 

Medium steers ranged from 142.2c to 160.2c while the heavy steers sold from 148.2c to 164.2c/kg, both weight grades eased slightly. Grown heifers sold to varied competition with the best C muscled lines averaging 122.9c/kg.

The largest percentages of the cows were D3 medium weights and the best of these reached 143.2c while the overall average was 131.2c/kg. A smaller number of lighter conditioned cows averaged 116.2c/kg."
"The yarding improved with a full panel of buyers in attendance. Overall quality was mixed with lightweight cows and heavy steers in greatest number.
 
Medium weight lines lifted 3c on top of 3c rises last week to average 172.9c/kg. Heavy steers were in greatest number with just over 250 head offered ranging from 178.2c to 186.2c/kg. 

Cows were dominated by light and medium weights with prices generally mixed. The lightweight 3 score lines averaged 143.1c and a large number of medium weights sold from 139.2c to 152.2c/kg."
"The yarding improved and all buyers competed strongly to secure their share. Overall quality was mixed with steers lines plain in condition and the cows better presented. Cattle were drawn from the local region plus additional supplies from Townsville and Richmond. 

Grown steers and bullocks were not to the standard of those offered in the past month, but this did not prevent prices from improving. Medium weight lines lifted 3c to average 169.8c and a large line of steers averaged 176.6c to be 2c/kg stronger. Bullocks were in similar numbers but quality was limited and few reached the levels of previous weeks. 

Cows were dominated by medium weights and the majority were in very good condition. Strong competition from a large contingent of processors coupled with the improved quality led to a stronger trend for medium weights the 3 score lines gaining 5c to average 149.9c/kg."
"The yarding fell significantly with just under 1000 cattle offered. Quality was similar to the previous sale, with only a small percentage of older cows offered. Drizzly rain over the past few days has boosted producers spirits, with some areas of the surrounding district receiving up to 2 inches. All the major export buyers operated plus a couple of local butchers.
 
Medium steers ranged from 134c to 153.2c while the heavy steers sold from 144c to 154c/kg, both weight grades struggled to improve from the rates of the last week. Grown heifers sold to varied competition with the best C muscled lines averaging 132.4c/kg.

The largest percentages of the cows were D3 medium weights and the best of these reached 136.2c while the overall average was 127.9c/kg. A smaller number of lighter conditioned cows averaged 118.2c/kg."
"The very small yarding sold to most of the usual buyers. Accurate quotes are difficult although the medium weight cows were 6c/kg dearer. There was a few heifers penned along with some steers. 

Light steers reached 119.2c and averaged 108.6c/kg. Heavy steers topped at 127.2c/kg. The better quality heifers averaged 105.5c and the poorer grades sold around 94c/kg. Light cows averaged 79.7c and the medium weights reached 105.2c to average 99.2c/kg."
"The usual processors competed for a mixed yarding of cattle with numbers lifting marginally compared to the last market. There were some pens of quality drafts offered with values remaining strong for these lines, however the buyers present discounted any unfinished plainer pens in price. Steers and cows were represented with high percentages with the heifer portion very limited in number.

 The better C muscled medium steers traded from146c to 160c while the heavier drafts sold from 148c to 159c/kg. D3 heifers returned values from 125c to 135c/kg.

Light D muscled cows recorded prices from 91c to 113c with the medium drafts selling from 93c to 129c/kg. The few heavy pens offered sold from 129c to 136c/kg. The top price for the bull categories was 136c/kg."
"The trend of a large supply of cattle continued following two sales last week with 3221 cattle penned. Despite the continuing dry conditions across much of the north and west, quality and condition of cattle was mostly good with an increased number of female cattle at hand. All regular processors were in attendance but operating selectively supported by regular feeders, backgrounders and restockers. Buyer demand was subdued on some lines with quality a factor. Prices eased for yearling steers and heifers by 20c, grown steers by 40c to 45c, heifers averaged 15c lower, while cows to processors fell by 20c/kg. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Richmond, Hughenden, Pentland, Georgetown, Ingham, Woodstock, Belyando, local and coastal areas. 

Young steer calves to restockers sold to 698.2c to average 644c and vealer steers above 200kg returning to grass made to 598.2c to average 548c to 574c/kg. Good quality large lines of vealer heifers to feed sold to 514.2c to average 501c to 504c/kg, while a good sample to the trade sold to 526.2c averaging 478c to 500c/kg. An increased supply of yearling steers above 280kg to feed reached 526.2c to average 481c/kg. Steers above 330kg to feed topped at 496.2c multiple times to average 470c/kg and restockers averaged 481c/kg. Yearling heifers above 280kg to feed sold to 460.2c to average 447c and heifers above 300kg also to feed topped at 460.2c to average 434c/kg.

A small number of mixed quality heavy full-mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 402.2c to average 400c/kg. 

Selective processor demand for cows resulted in an easing trend on recent weeks. Medium weight 2 score cows made to 324.2c to average 320c, 3 score cows to processors reached 364.2c to average 333c and prime heavyweights topped at 360.2c to average 344c/kg. A large sample of cows to opportunity restockers sold to 338.2c to average 323c/kg. Heavy bulls to processors sold to 330.2c to average 329c/kg.  

A small number of good quality cows and calves sold from $1,900 to $2,450/unit.

"The total prime cattle yarded at Charters Towers this week was 307 head.  The market held up quite well despite the absence of one Northern processor.

Market Reporter: Mick Kingham"
"The supply of cattle was similar to last week with 1,721 head offered in Charters Towers, featuring some good lines of heavy prime cows, bullocks and bulls supported by some very good quality lines of northern store steers. The usual buying panel was operating at increased rates, particularly for better quality heavy prime cattle. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Chillagoe, Georgetown, Tully, Balfes Ck, Ravenswood, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

Light vealer steers to restockers improved by 7c and a small sample of quality young heifers increase by 16c/kg.

Market Reporter, Mick Kingham"
"The supply of cattle fell by 748 head to 3,537 this week, largely due to a controversial council decision to cap numbers to accommodate two live exporter bookings for yard space. Quality was variable throughout, however some very good lines of heavy prime cows and bullocks were on offer, along with some very good vealer steers and heifers. Two major processors were again absent from the buyer panel, however southern processor and feeder orders continued along with one additional central processor and two live exporters. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Croydon, Georgetown, Mt Garnet, Julia Ck, Ingham, Ayr, local and coastal areas.

Demand for mixed sex calves was strong throughout, with some very good steers returning to grass topping at 436.2c, with a large sample averaging above 400c, while light heifer calves returning to the paddock sold to 432.2c, most averaging 369c/kg. Vealer steers to restockers sold to 396.2c averaging from 380 to 388c/kg. Vealer heifers to processors reached 374.2c, to average 366c, while those to feed sold to 300c/kg. Yearling steers to back grounders reached 364.2c, to average 340c to 356c, while restockers paid to 370.2c, with most sales above 360c/kg. Yearling heifers were of mixed quality, with better bred pens to feed selling to 319.2c, to average from 302c to 314c/kg.

Increased numbers of grown steers to feed sold to 344.2c, and grown heifers to the trade reached 296.2c, to average 272c to 282c/kg. Heavy bullocks to export processors topped at 330c multiple times, to average 313c, while suitable pens to live export also reached 330c, to average above 325c/kg. Continued strong demand for cows saw medium weight 2 scores to processors sell to 255.2c, to average 230c, and 3 score cows averaged 253c to 267c, topping at 274c/kg. Strong demand for heavy bulls to live export resulted in a top of 328.2c, averaging 313c to 319c, while young males returning to grass reached 414.2c, to average 340c to 398c/kg. A small number of good quality cows and calves sold from $1,380 to 1,400/unit."
"The supply of cattle fell by 580 for a yarding 1870 head. Quality was mostly good throughout, with a similar number of prime cattle to last sale, however store pens consisted of many smaller lines. Only three regular processors were in attendance and operating, supported by one live exporter, regular feeders and opportunity retsockers.  Cattle were drawn from Burketown, Richmond, Greenvale, Harvey’s Range, local and coastal areas.

Reduced demand for prime cattle saw values ease with bullocks down 10-18c, cows 3 to 12c lower and heavy bulls averaged 10-20c less.

Young suitably weaned steers to backgrounders averaged 253c, selling to 282c. Similar heifers to processors made to 174c to average 170c/kg. Light yearling steers returning to the paddock made to 268c, averaging from 232c to 252c, steers above 280kg sold to 262c to average 246c/kg. Yearling heifers were insufficient to reliable quote and sold according to quality.

Grown steers above 400kg to the trade sold to 225c to average 214c, heavy grown steers reached 228c to average 221c/kg.  A good supply of grown heifers to the trade sold to 228c to average from 203c to 221c/kg.

A mixed quality sample of heavy full mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 233c to average from 213c to 227c/ kg.  A large sample of medium weight 3 score cows to processors sold to 202c to average from 172c to 188c and a small number of prime heavyweight cows averaged 195c/kg.

Medium weight bulls to live export sold from 236c to 244c, heavy bulls to feed destined for live export sold to 246c multiple times to average 241c and processor bulls averaged 196c/kg.

Several good quality small lines of cows and calves sold from $1,000 to $1,240 per unit.

Market Reporter, Mick Kingham"
"The supply of cattle eased by 595 head on a fortnight ago to 618 mixed quality cattle. Isolated storms across much of the supply area reduced numbers of many store lines, affecting buyer participation. Only three regular processors were in operation along with opportunity restockers, backgrounder and feeder buyers. The limited supply of prime cattle saw values increase 14c to 20c/kg, with only a small number of pens of suitable weight fro processors. Most store lines were up to 40c/kg easier on last sale. Cattle were mostly drawn from the local area.

Mixed sex calves to restockers sold to 466.2c to average 441c and processor types averaged 414c/kg. Vealer steers returning to the paddock topped at 458.2c to average 443c/kg. Prime vealer heifers to processors sold to 416.2c to average 408c/kg. A small number of yearling steers to feed sold to 407.2c to average 404c and yearling heifers to feed reached 354.2c, while backgrounder heifers made to 366.2c/kg. Grown heifers to the trade sold to 250.2c to average 246c/kg.  

A small number of bullocks to live export made 356.2c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows topped at 266.2c to average 251c, with heavy 3 score cows topping at 308.2c for a single cow, to average 265c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export made to 318.2c with most selling from 280c to 295c/kg. Light males to restockers sold to 436.2c to average 406c/kg."
"The supply of cattle continues to increase with 3,276 cattle penned, 177 more than last week. Quality was generally good throughout the yarding which featured increased numbers of heavy prime cows, bulls and bullocks, supported by some excellent store steers. The regular buyer panel operated strongly throughout all categories with increased feeder orders actively supported by central and northern backgrounders. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Croydon, Georgetown, Richmond, Hugenden, Ingham, local and coastal areas. Heavy grown steers and bullocks were up 7c to 9c from last sale and heavy bulls held firm to 10c/kg higher. 

Steer calves to restockers sold to a top of 486c and crossbred heifer calves reached 466c with mixed sexes averaging 454c/kg. Light vealer steers to central backgrounders sold to 500c to average 444c, with a large sample of excellent quality heavy vealer steers making 466c to average 456c/kg. Vealer heifers in forward condition to restockers sold to a top of 408c, averaging from 393c to 404c and trade types averaged near 382c/kg.

Increased numbers of suitable yearling heifers to feed above 330kg sold to 400c to average 365c/kg. 

Good quality grown steers to feed topped at 388c to average 355c and trade types averaging 358c/kg. Greater numbers of grown heifers attracted strong feeder demand selling to 332c to average 325c and heavy trade types reached 326c to average above 313c/kg. Heavy full-mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 358c, with most averaging 355c to 356c/kg. Cows met very strong demand on all categories with many processors jostling to fill orders. Medium weight cows to processors sold to 280 and averaged 269c, while score 3 cows reached 288c averaging 282c/kg. Greater numbers of prime heavy weight cows topped at 292c to average 288c/kg. Good lines of cows to active restocker orders sold to 290c, averaging 277c to 283c/kg. Heavy bulls to feed destined for live export sold to a top of 348c with most selling from 308c to 340c/kg.

Market Reporter, Mick Kingham."
"The supply of cattle continues to increase with 2,017 cattle penned in a prime only sale. Quality was mixed with some large single vendor lines of heavy prime bullocks and cows, with increased numbers of plain conditioned northern cows and bulls. All regular processors were in attendance and operating, supported by two southern feeder orders. Cattle were predominantly drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Normanton and Georgetown, with smaller lines from the local area.

Good quality grown steers lifted 23c and heifers averaged mostly firm, prime cows eased 6c and heavy bulls to processors finished 10c easier. An increased supply of grown steers above 400kg to feed averaged 410c reaching 432.2c multiple times, while heavy steers to the trade sold to and averaged 384c/kg. Grown heifers to feed reached 396.2c to average 357c to 380c/kg.

There were more than 700 heavy bullocks on offer. Heavy bullocks to processors topped at 398.2c to average 386c to 398c/kg. Increased numbers of plain conditioned cows to feed sold to 330.2c to average 316c/kg.

A store sale scheduled for Friday has 4,500 cattle booked.

Market Reporter, Mick Kingham."
"The smaller yarding was mainly the result of the short trading week, although all the regular buyers were in attendance. There were some good quality stock available and light 1 and 2 score steers and cows were of a better standard than previous weeks. The better quality medium weight steers were 4c dearer and some poorer grades eased 5c/kg. Heavy steers were well above last weeks rates. Poorer heifers were slightly dearer with insufficient good grades to quote. Light poor gains gained 4c while the medium weights eased 1c to 2c/kg. Bulls were mostly 2c/kg cheaper. 

Light steers sold to an isolated 140c with most around 117c/kg. The medium weight C3s topped at 174.2c to average 162.2c while the large number of D3s averaged 137c/kg. A small number of heavy steers peaked at 176.2c and averaged 173.2c/kg.  The best heifers made to 121.2c/kg. 

Light D1 cows made to 89.2c and averaged 86.5c with the best stock to 111.2c/kg. Medium weight cows sold to 129.2c and the D3s averaged 120.1c with most D2s around 107c/kg. Light bulls averaged 81c and heavy weights sold to 108.2c/kg."
"The small penning sold to most of the regular buyers. The limited number made an accurate quote difficult and quality was reported to be poor. Light steers, and heifers along with medium weight cows were in the greatest numbers. 

Medium weight steers reached 110c while the heavy steers and bullocks ranged from 80c to 97c/kg.  The heifers were all of poor quality and most averaged below 70c/kg. Medium weight cows sold to 81.2c and a fair sample averaged 79.7c/kg."
"The slightly smaller yarding was offered to a full panel of buyers. The quality was improved on the last sale and when this is combined with the very active buyers values improved for most categories. Most of the cattle offered were from local areas, but a small number were also penned from the Northern Territory. 

The steers and bullocks received the largest gains for the day. The better quality medium weights managed to top at 220.2c, but it was the heavy steers that were the highlight of the sale after reaching 225.2c/kg. All of the heavy steers and bullocks returned above $1,100/head.

A large number of light heifers were offered with the better quality descriptions selling to 185c/kg. Most of the cows offered were light weights. The D2s made to 169.2c as some very good medium weights topped at 191.2c/kg. 

Nearly all of the bulls offered were light weights reaching 179.2c with the heavy weights making to 193.2c/kg."
"The slightly increased yarding was offered to the usual field of buyers. Cattle were drawn mainly from the local supply areas and producers who did offer stock were well rewarded. The quality of the yarding is slipping, but there was a small number of good pens scattered throughout. These good pens sold to fierce competition with record prices resulting. 

The light steers sold to 197.2c as the medium weights reached 208.5/kg. The highlight of the sale was the heavy steers selling to a record 229.2c/kg and over 100 head averaging over 222c/kg. 

The large numbers of heifers were unable to sustain last weeks gains, however the better types did sell to 193.2c/kg. The cow market was also cheaper in places with the falling quality being the major factor. A large number of light cows averaged 150.8c as the medium weight D3s topped at 198.2c/kg. 

The bulls were offered in large numbers with the light and heavy weights receiving further gains. The top of the heavy weights sold to 203.2c/kg and returned over $1,600/head."
"The slightly increased yarding was made up completely of export descriptions and it was reported as improved on last weeks quality. Most of the usual buyers were present and active, however values were mixed with the bulls receiving the largest gains. 

The limited numbers of light steers improved 4c to average 133c, as the medium weights topped at 141.2c/kg. Both the heavy steers and bullocks sold to 156.2c, as the large numbers of heavy steers averaged 145.6c/kg. 

The light heifers had a mixed day, with the D2s receiving a gain, yet large numbers of D3s suffered a fall to average 132.2c/kg. The cows also had a mixed day, with the light D2s slipping 5c to average 109.6c, while spirited competition on the large number of medium weight D3s saw prices top at 149.2c/kg. The heavy cows reached 145.2c to average 142.9c/kg. 

The medium bulls sold to 148.2c, as the heavy weights topped at 152.2c to return over $1,100/head."
"The selling agents sold 758 prime cattle over the live weight scales at Charters Towers on Thursday.  The majority of the yarding sold at dearer rates.  

In the export cattle, medium weight steers sold to 124.8c/kg for a good sample of D2s and these averaged 117.7c/kg to be 2c dearer than last week.  Heavy steers sold to 126.2c and were up to 6c/kg dearer.  

A big numbers of heifers sold to a top of 111.2c/kg.  Cows were plentiful in the yarding and were recorded to 107.2c for a large sample of D2 cows, and these averaged 90.8c/kg to be around 4c easier.  Bulls sold up to 105.2c/kg."
"The selling agents in Charters Towers sold 850 prime cattle on Thursday, a rise of 562 head compared with last week.  

The D1 light weight steers sold to 120.6c, medium weight steers D2 made to 128.2c to average 123.6c/kg. A fair sample of heifers, D2 sold to 120c and these averaged 116.2c/kg.  While best of the heavier steers and ox peaked at 128.2c/kg. 

Cows were well supplied and the best of the heavy cows, D2 sold up to 109.8c/kg for a good sample.  The heavy bulls sold in a range from one dollar to 114.2c to average 110.3c/kg."
"The selling agents in Charters Towers sold 850 prime cattle at their weekly market on Thursday. Prices were generally easier this week, in line with other southern Queensland auctions.

Lighter steers in the export classes sold to 108.2c/kg in several instances.  Medium stees weighing to 500kg, B3, sold up to 125.2c to average 110.7c/kg.  Heavy steers reached 126.2c for a large sample of B4, while a few other bullocks in the heavy weight range made to 125.2c/kg.

The best of the export weight heifers sold up to 119.6c/kg.  Cows were well supplied, and sold to 113.6c for a large sample of B3 cows, and these averaged 95.4c/kg.  Bulls met an excellent market and reached 121.2c/kg."
"The selling agents in Charters Towers sold 410 prime cattle on Wednesday where all descriptions sold to an excellent market.  

The small yarding resulted in medium weight steers making to 147.2c/kg for a large sample of B3s.  Heavy steers reached 148.2c and a few other heavier ox peaked at 147.2c/kg.  The best of the heifers sold to 114.2c/kg.

"The second special sale in a fortnight saw 1,385 cattle penned 2,768 fewer than the previous sale. Despite some late withdrawals, the offering consisted of very good quality steers and heifers, with some PTIC heifers, cows and young males. The buyer gallery was limited to one live exporter, one feeder buyer and a small number of restockers and backgrounders. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Palmerston, Dimbulah, Greenvale, Tully, Ravenswood, local and coastal areas.

Light steer calves sold firm to restockers, while a large sample of vealer steers sold eased by more than 20c/kg. Yearling steers mostly sold to feed, easing by 15c/kg, while grown steers sold firm. Vealer heifers met limited demand, easing by up to 55c/kg, for majority penned. Yearling heifers to live export sold firm and similar heifers returning to grass improved by 4c/kg. PTIC heifers and cows attracted limited buyer interest. Steers calves sold to 268c to average 255c, while vealer steers made to 270c to average 259c/kg for the better quality types. The main run of vealer heifers sold to 172c to average lower at 165c/kg.

"The rise of cattle prices over recent weeks saw the yarding increase by 462 head to 3,454 cattle this week. Some very good lines of cows and grown heifers were accompanied by some large lines of northern steers and heifers. The prime market saw values for bullocks ease 4c to 7c/kg and cows were back 10c to 16c/kg, in line with southern markets and easier grid values being offered by processors. One regular processor was again absent this week, notably reducing competition on better finished heavy cattle. Store cattle again sold very strongly to western and central restockers and feeder buyers, despite prices easing in the prime market. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Croydon, Georgetown, Tully, Home Hill, Woodstock, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were of very good quality and condition with the best types selling to 386.2c/kg to western restockers. Yearling steers eased slightly on last sale, with lighter types selling to 370c to restockers and prices reaching 348c for heavier types to feeder buyers, to average 334.1c/kg. Vealer heifers sold stronger on last sale, with restockers and feeder buyers active on better conditioned types which sold to 344.2c/kg. Some large heavier lines of northern heifers were dearer to feeder buyers which sold to 322.2c, to average 304.7c, while restockers paid to 348.2c/kg for lighter types.

Grown steers sold to feeder buyers for a top of 329c/kg. Heavy 3 score bullocks to slaughter were fewer in number, following easing prices and buyer competition last sale, and sold to 299.2c/kg. Live exporters were active on most lines which sold to 292.2c, to average 284.5c/kg. Lighter, less finished types reached 268.2c/kg. Another good quality yarding 3 and 4 score cows saw values ease 10c to 13c and prices for medium weight 2 score cows eased by 14c to 16c/kg. Prices for heavier types eased on last sale as a result of less processor competition, topping at 238.2c and averaging 227.8c/kg. Some very good 4 score cows sold to 246c/kg. Processors were selective on 2 score cows which sold to 235.2c and averaged 217.6c/kg. Good heavy 3 score bulls to slaughter sold to 272.2c, while a live exporter paid to 271.2c/kg for medium and heavy weight bulls. Restockers paid too 396.2c for lighter young males, 27c/kg less than last sale. Another good offering of cows and calves sold to $1,420, with most selling from $1,220 to $1,380/unit."
"The recent uplift in prices has seen a significant increase in the supply of cattle, resulting in a prime only sale with 2328 cattle penned. Quality was mixed, however there were several large lines of good quality heavy bullocks and cows. All processors were in attendance and operating, supported by one live exporter and regular feeders. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Mt Garnet, Hughenden local and coastal areas. 

There was only a limited number of yearling cattle due to a store sale being held on Friday. Processor demand  was strong throughout, although most categories eased on last week’s gains primarily due to the increased supply and some pens lacking weight. Grown steers eased 15c, heifers averaged 6c to 22c lower, heavy bullocks fell 17c, medium weight cows averaged 3c to 16c lower, however heavy bulls to processors improved by up to 20c/kg. 

A small sample of yearling heifers above 280kg to processors sold to 260c to average 258c, heifers above 330kg to feed averaged 257c, while heifers above 400kg to the trade sold to 278c to average 276c/kg. 

Grown steers above 400kg to feed sold to 282c, trade types made to 318c to average 294c/kg. Increased numbers of heavy grown steers above 500kg to processors reached 320c to average 308c and a good sample of steers above 600kg also topped at 320c to average 312c/kg. Mixed quality small lines of grown heifers to the trade sold to 268c to average 248c to 266c/kg.

Heavy full mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 328c to average 307c, lighter bullocks averaged 295c/kg.

A small number of cows and calves sold for $775per unit.

Approximately 2,200 cattle have been booked for a store sale on Friday.

Market Reporter, Mick Kingham"
"The recent trend of declining numbers saw 793 cattle drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents, representing a reduction of 631 head on last sale. Some odd lines of well finished prime cows and bullocks improved 6c to 8c/kg, while mixed lines of store steers and heifers had limited demand, seeing values ease across most lines. One processor returned along with a feeder buyer, which improved competition throughout the sale. Cattle came from Mount Isa, Richmond, Georgetown, Mount Garnet, Woodstock, as well as local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers comprised many small mixed lines. A line of northern steer calves sold to 210c to restockers, who also secured better bred medium and heavy vealers up to 244c/kg. Very few yearling steers were on offer, receiving limited demand from the gallery. Medium weight steers to live export sold for 220c, while 330kg plus steers going to backgrounders also made 220c/kg. A small number of vealer heifers in mixed lines sold to irregular values, with better quality heifers to slaughter making 193/kg. One northern line of light heifer calves to restockers sold for 202c/kg. Yearling heifers comprised of many small lines, with processors and feeder buyers active throughout. Heifers above 280kg to slaughter made to 211c and heifers above 330kg sold at 199c/kg. Heifers above 330kg to feed made 212c and heavy heifers above 400kg sold at 214c/kg.

Fewer numbers of heavy export bullocks improved 6c, topping at 256c to average 252c, while medium weight bullocks to slaughter reached 239c/kg. A selection of heavy grown steers for slaughter also sold to 239c/kg. Plain bullocks to slaughter sold at 233c, to average 206c/kg.

Heavy cows were in fewer numbers, however some small lines of good heavy yielding cows were on offer. Better quality, heavy 3 score cows to slaughter sold to 197c to average 193c, improving 9c/kg on last sale. Extra heavy 3 score cows sold to 198c/kg. Heavy D muscled cows topped at 195c to average 179c and 2 score cows to slaughter averaged 161c/kg. The return of one processor saw values improve for medium weight 2 score cows by up to 30c to average 136c/kg, with cows showing improved weight and yield on previous week. The absence of live exporters saw values decrease by up to 20c for heavy bulls, with those to slaughter topping at 221c to average 204c/kg. Heavy bulls to feed destined for live export sold to 240c, with most sales making from 207c to 224c, while medium weight bulls to feed sold to 200c, to average 148c/kg. A selection of bulls weighing 280-330kg going to live export sold to 224c/kg. Young males to restockers sold to 244c/kg. Small lines of good quality cows and calves sold to $890/unit."
"The prime cattle component at Charters Towers this week totalled 1,109 head.  

In the steers, best of the medium weights sold to 118c to average 107c/kg.  While a good sample of D3s in the bullocks reached 125c/kg.  A large sample in the heifers sold to 107.2c/kg with other D3s to 111.2c to average 104.6c/kg. 

Cows were in good supply, best of the heavy cows selling to 110.2c/kg and bulls sold to 114.2c to average 109.4c/kg."
"The opening sale of the year saw 1,213 mixed quality cattle penned, comprising of less than one third prime cattle. Most slaughter lines generally lacked weight and prices eased accordingly throughout. Prices across most prime categories were 20c to 30c lower than the close of 2020, however prices for light steer and heifer categories improved by up to 150c/kg.

"The opening sale of 2019 for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents comprised of 1,138 mixed quality cattle, with several lines showing the effects of a continuing dry season, particularly lines from western areas. Two regular processors were absent, along with one feeder buyer. Additionally, there were several restockers and backgrounders present, but they were inactive, and there is still an absence of any reliable wet season rain. Cattle were drawn from McKinlay, Pentland, Ingham, local and coastal areas.

All rates were stronger than the close of 2019, with cows showing the greatest increase in price. Minimal numbers of prime bullocks were on offer, with quality of most cattle generally good with one large consignment of northern cattle, supported by several small local lines. Not all regular processors were in attendance in a large gallery of onlookers, supported by two feeder buyers, a central backgrounder and opportunity restockers.

"The opening sale for 2023 attracted 1141 cattle.  Quality was very mixed, with a few good pens of heavy prime cows, a good number of heavy bulls, supported by one very good local line of yearling steers.  The gallery consisted of all regular processors, opportunity feeders  and restockers, along with a large number of interested onlookers. Cattle were drawn from Richmond, Pentland, Tully and mostly the local area.
 
Values for most categories ease on  the close of 2022, however demand for quality

"The much larger yarding compared to last weeks ANZAC Day market saw a large number of very poor quality stock penned. There was only limited competition from a field of buyers that was missing a number of regulars. The overall availability of a large number of stock and lack of genuine quality at the sale were the main factors in a cheaper market. 

The medium weight steers sold to a top of 126.2c and a fair sample averaged 5c cheaper at 123.9c/kg. There was some fair quality heavy steers available and the C2s reached 137.2c and averaged 135.4c/kg. The poorer heavy steers lost considerable ground and D3s averaged 124.6c/kg. A limited number of heavy bullocks sold to a top of 143.2c/kg.

The heifers were around 4c cheaper and the D2s averaged 102.1c/kg. The cow yarding saw values drop and there were no cows sold that made over 100c/kg. The best cows sold to a top of 95.2c and a large number of medium weight E2s averaged 77.2c/kg."
"The move to a Wednesday sale saw an increase in numbers with nearly all stock sold over the scales. Quality was similar to recent weeks and a normal standard for this period of the year. All the regular buyers were in attendance and keen to purchase stock. Values were generally dearer with steers up to 18c higher while the cows mainly gained 18c to 23c/kg. 

Light steers sold to 125.2c and a small number averaged 118.7c/kg. The medium weights topped at 142.2c with the best stock averaging 141.9c, though poorer grades saw most sales around 125.7c/kg. Heavy steers reached 147.2c/kg. Heifers sold to 118.2c and a good number saw most sales around 108c/kg. 

A large number of light cows were penned and they topped at 95c, though most averaged around 85c/kg.  A number of very poor cows went against the dearer trend and averaged below 60c/kg. Medium weight cows peaked at 125.2c and the D3s averaged 120.3c while the D2s recorded some of the largest gains and averaged 107.6c/kg. Heavy bulls made to 117.2c/kg."
"The larger yarding sold to the regular field of buyers plus some added competition and values were generally dearer. Steers were generally of better quality while there was still a fair supply of light and poor quality cows and heifers available. Steers improved 2c to 3c and heifers were generally slightly cheaper while the cows gained 4c to 11c/kg. 

Light steers topped at 117.2c and averaged 111.9c/kg. The medium weights were in the largest supply and topped at 136.2c with the better quality grades averaging 129.1c. The D2s saw most sales around 113c/kg. A small number of heavy steers and bullocks topped at 133.2c/kg. 

Heifers reached 122c and averaged 114.5c/kg. The light cows sold to 99.2c and most sold around 84c/kg. Medium weight cows topped at 112.2c and averaged 105.6c/kg."
"The larger yarding followed the cheaper trend set at other centres, although not the extent experienced at some. There was a good number of fair quality cattle considering the size of the yarding although there was also a fair supply of poorer quality stock. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance and operated on a yarding dominated by medium and heavy weight steers along with medium weight cows.

The medium weight steers were slightly cheaper and the better quality stock averaged just under 130c while the majority averaged around 119c/kg. The heavy steers were of fair quality and averaged slightly cheaper at 132.6c after they reached 137.2c/kg. 

There were an insufficient number of heifers to provide a reliable quote. The light cows were all of poor quality and topped at 66.2c/kg. The best medium weights topped at 120.2c and over 20 percent of the total yarding were D3s that averaged 2c cheaper 108.3c/kg. 

The best heavy bulls sold to a top of 100.2c/kg."
"The larger yarding compares to the sale of two weeks ago, and due to the small numbers at both sales an accurate trend is not possible. Steers dominated the yarding while heifers and cows were fairly represented. 

Light steers averaged 105.3c/kg while the medium weights were in the largest numbers. The better quality medium weights averaged 124.5c and reached 130.2c while a large number of D3s averaged 116.4c/kg. A pen of heavy steers sold for 126.2c/kg. 

The better quality heifers reached 132.2c although most of the lighter quality heifers averaged 106.7c/kg. Medium weight cows reached 100.2c and averaged 93.2c/kg."
"The larger number was offered to the regular field of buyers and although quality was lacking, values improved for a large percentage of the yarding. The light steers lost ground while the medium weights eased slightly and heavy steers improved 4c/kg. Heifers traded 2c either side of firm while the cows gained 1c to 4c/kg. 

Light steers sold to 114.2c and averaged just under 100c/kg. The medium weight steers topped at 125.2c and averaged from 112c to 121.5c/kg. The heavy steers made to 135.2c, which saw most sales around 130c/kg. The heavy bullocks sold around 134c/kg. 

Heifers topped at 121.2c and most averaged around 113c/kg. The light cows in better condition averaged 88c while the poorer grades saw most sales around 58c/kg. Medium weight cows topped at 118.2c and the D3s averaged 106.5c while the heavy cows also sold to 118.2c/kg."
"The large yardings continued, with numbers increasing by more than 500 to 3,831 cattle in Charters Towers under gloomy skies with light misty rain across much of the local area and a positive outlook for rain ahead. The supply of cows continued the recent upward trend with almost 1,800 penned in a yarding of mixed quality, given the large numbers being presented. The regular buyer panel was joined by one NSW processor and a southern backgrounder, supported by central and western backgrounders and feeder orders. Cattle were drawn from Northern Territory, Dimbulah, Burketown, Croydon, Georgetown, Julia Ck,  Richmond, Ingham, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers continued recent strong demand, however eased 14c, while similar heifers returning to paddock eased up to 40c/kg, most quality related, mostly to southern orders, while trade types sold firm. Light weight yearling steers to feed eased 15c with reduced numbers on offer, while better quality medium weights to feed eased by 2c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed increased by 10c to 30c/kg depending on quality. Grown heifers to feed improved by nearly 40c, with heavy heifers to the trade increasing by 10c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows to processors lifted by 14c, heavy cows increased by 15c to 30c/kg. Heavy bulls to background feed and processors improved by 30c/kg.

A large line of very good quality cows and calves above 3mths sold for $1,440, with smaller lines making from $920 to $1,320/unit."
"The large yarding of last week was maintained, with cattle being sourced from up to four hours away while large numbers were also being brought forward locally. Despite the increase in numbers, quality was similar with both steers and cows having a small proportion of plain lines offered. All major processors operated with cattle being sent to processing works around the state.

The quality of grown steers was aided by a large consignment from Mount Gravett as well as increased supplies from local regions. Medium weights ranged from 133.2c to 145c and a large supply of heavy 4 score steers sold from 150.2c to 163.2c/kg. The large number led to prices easing slightly as processors competed only to justify purchase levels. Bullock quality was as good as has been seen at this selling centre and prices ranged from 156.2c to 165.2c/kg to average over $1,000/head.

The cow quality was similar to the previous market and prices also maintained a firm trend. The greatest percentage of medium weights sold from 129.2c to 136.2c, while in comparison, lighter conditioned lightweights were discounted to average 118c/kg. A smaller number of heavyweights topped at 144.2c to average 142c/kg."

"The first sale for the year saw very few cattle penned. Only local butchers were present and active in the market with no major meat works operating.

Due to the very limited number of cattle offered, it is difficult to accurately provide any quotes."

"The final sale of the year attracted 3612 cattle. The prime yarding was limited to 438, with several small mixed lines, a small number were well finished.  Three regular processors were in attendance, along with regular feeders, two live exporters and opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Richmond, to Chillagoe, east to Ingham and south to the local area.

Demand for prime cattle was limited, however store steers and heifers received good demand from feeders and restockers. Most categories eased eased 10c to 30c on a fortnight ago, however young heifers average 20c to 60c lower, with poorer quality types remaining difficult to sell.

"The final sale of the calendar year for Charters Towers Combined Agents drew a yarding of 1,062 mixed quality cattle, dominated by 833 store cattle and a plainer consignment of cattle in the prime section. There were no processors present, however the buyer gallery was active, with restockers, backgrounders and feeder buyers active throughout the sale, with strong competition for better types. The limited number of heavy weight cattle attracted interest from feeder buyers destined for live export, whilst restockers showed strong interest for better grown steers and heifers.  

Vealer heifers topped at 268.2c, with many small lines selling consistently to 250c/kg. Vealer steers attracted strong restocker interest and topped at 301.2c/kg. An increased number of yearling heifers were strongly contested and topped at 280.2c, with many lines selling to 262.2c/kg.

Grown steers sold strongly, particularly to feeder interest, selling to 283.2c, with the top selling line to restockers making 295.2c/kg. Cows were limited in supply and sold to 215.2c/kg for the very few 3 score cows. A mixed selection of bulls sold to limited buyer interest with the lack of processor competition and sold to 219.2c/kg for heavy bulls.  Younger age, lighter bulls sold to feeder buyers, destined for live export and sold to 245.2c, with vealer bulls selling to 275.2c/kg to restockers. A very small offering of cows and calves were sold from $480 to $680/unit. 

The first sale for 2016 is scheduled for January 20th."

The supply of well finished prime bullocks and cows was minimal, store lines consisted of several plain conditioned lines and there was a large consignment of northern bulls. Only three major processors were in attendance and operating, supported by regular feeders, one live exporter and opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Normanton, east to Innisfail and south to the local area.

Demand for most classes was good, particularly better quality types. Lightweight steers and heifers  improved 6c to 15c, feeder heifers improved 20c to 50c, grown steers and heifers improved 2c to 7c and prime cows lifted 6c to 9c/kg.

Lightweight steers to restockers averaged 272c, reaching 300c, steers above 200kg averaged 254c to 278c/kg.

"The entire gallery of trade buyers competed for a generally better quality line of cattle especially in the better-finished drafts. Numbers fell marginally compared to the last market with the greatest percentage falling into the cow categories. There were also fair numbers of grown steers offered with the heifer portion limited in number.

Medium C muscled steers traded from 140.2c to 159.2c with the heavier drafts reaching 154.2c with most sales around the 150c/kg mark. Heifers were mainly unfinished and these sold from 113.2c to 125c while the better-finished lines traded from 127c to 140c/kg.

Light cows sold from 104c to 124.2c as the medium pens traded from 116c to 134c/kg."
"The Easter break has once again caused a reduced yarding with the quality of the export weight offered reported as on a par with last week. All of the usual buyers were in attendance and operating in a market that yielded mixed results.  

There were insufficient light steers to get an accurate quote, however medium weight D3s lost 5c to average 149.5c after selling to 157.2c/kg. The least effected by the falling trend was the heavy D3s which only lost 2c to average 157.7c/kg. Heavy D3 bullocks sold to 164.6c and returned over $1,100/head. 

The females were able to realise increased rates, unlike the males. Similar to other centres, the heifers were all lightweights and they improved 3c/kg. In the largest number, the D3s sold to 145.6c and averaged 142c/kg. The light cows received the largest gain of the day, after topping at 130.2c/kg. Large numbers of medium weight D3s reached 148.2c, as the limited numbers of heavy weights offered sold to 138.2c/kg.

All of the bulls offered were D1s with the medium and heavy weights suffering losses. The heavy weights topped at 144.2c/kg."
"The drier conditions have allowed for extra cattle to be penned this week at all centres, and Charters Towers was no different with an extra 150 head offered. In a yarding of mainly D types with a few E types, values for most saw a fall after the good sales last week. 

Large numbers of medium weight D2 steers reached 142.2c to average 136.4c/kg as bullocks weighing from 500 to 600kg topped the sale after reaching 151.2c and averaging 143.6c/kg.

Light D2 bulls topped the bull section with 126.2c with medium weight D2s in the largest numbers selling to 110c/kg."
"The current good prices and the dry conditions combined and resulting in a much larger yarding being offered. Helping to increase numbers was large lines of cattle from the Richmond area. The offering contained good even lines of cattle that improved the overall quality of the yarding. Even though numbers improved, it had no negative effect on values, as an extra buyer was present. 

The light steers were in relatively small numbers as were the heavy bullocks. Medium weight D3s were in large numbers and sold to 179.2c while the heavy steers reached 186.6c/kg. The heavy bullocks were again in demand topping the sale after selling to 190.2c/kg and returning over $1,200/head. 

Similar to other centres, the light heifers came under increased demand with the better types selling to 181.2c/kg. The large numbers of light cows sold well with the D2s topping at 165.2c/kg. There were good even lines of cows that met very good competition from all buyers with the best of the medium weights selling to 174.2c/kg. The heavy cows were in limited numbers and a small pen sold for 167.2c/kg. 

Increased numbers of light bulls were offered selling to 139.2c as the heavy weights sold to 169.2ckg and returned over $1,300/head."
"The continuing dry conditions and failed rain forecasts further increased numbers by 659 head to 3,035 cattle. The supply of prime cows and grown steers doubled on last sale with some very good lines penned while quality in the store section was mixed.

A couple of heavy bulls made to 117.6c/kg."
"The agents at Charters Towers offered an increased yarding, as nearly 800 head were penned. The yarding was dominated by steers and heifers, in a completely export type offering. The buyers were keen to secure stock and as a result, values for most types realised rises.

In the largest number, D3 medium weight steers sold to a top of 161.2c, while heavier D3s reached 162.2c and averaged almost 160c/kg. The D3 heavy bullocks also reached 162.2c to return in excess of $1,000/head.

"Supply was again reduced and prices were dearer. Not all buyers were in attendance however processor competition again was quite strong, especially on the best cattle. Steers improved by 8c to 11c/kg while the heifers were slightly cheaper. The light cows improved 4c/kg and the medium weights lost some ground on last weeks very high rates. 

The light steers sold to 139.2c and averaged 132.5c/kg. The medium weights peaked at 165.2c and the best stock averaged 157.7c while the 2 score grades saw most sales around 147c/kg.

All regular processors were active along with one southern operator, one live exporter, feeder and opportunity restockers and backgrounders.  Cattle were drawn from Burketown to Georgetown, south to The Belyando and the local area.

Values improved by 2-10c on most categories with strong demand for heavier better yielding prime cattle, however young lightweight cattle met limited demand and were difficult to sell.

"Some useful storm rain across much of the supply area over the past week saw numbers increase by 400 head for a yarding of 2512 cattle. Quality was very mixed with some good lines of heavy, well finished bullocks, cows of mixed condition and quality, a large consignment of northern bulls and some good quality lines of store cattle. A reduced buyer panel consisted of four major processors, one live exporter and opportunity feeders and restockers. Cattle were drawn from McArthur River in the north, Richmond to Ingham and south to The Belyando and local area.

Values for prime categories were firm to 8c higher, depending on quality, restocker and feeder types lifted 9c to 50c/kg. Secondary and lesser quality lightweight cattle attracted minimal buyer support.

A minimal number of young steers sold according to quality similar heifers returning to the paddock averaged 267c, light heifers to feed destined for slaughter averaged 223c/kg. Yearling steers above 330kg to feed made to 284c to average 280c/kg. Good quality yearling heifers above 280kg to feed made 252c and heifers above 330kg sold to 266c/kg.

"Some recent isolated rain and shortage of cattle saw numbers fall by more than 1,000, for a yarding of just on 900 head for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, with quality of all classes of cattle variable throughout. All major processors were in attendance and operating, supported by one feeder buyer and some central and western restockers. Cattle were drawn from Cloncurry, Winton, Richmond, Greenvale, Ingham, Woodstock, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were fewer in number than recent weeks, however restockers were particularly active on lighter types, selling to 443c, with many lines selling from 384c to 405c/kg. Yearling steers were of variable quality and weight, with best steers to feed selling to 314c/kg. Vealer heifer numbers were notably less than recent weeks, however restockers were particularly active on lighter types, with heifers returning to the paddock topping at 374c/kg. Yearling heifers were limited in supply and quality was variable, with few suitable heifers to feed selling to 282c, while heifers to restockers sold to 282c/kg.

Bullocks continued the trend of recent sales with variable quality and age.  The small number of 3 score bullocks to slaughter averaged 268c, selling to 274c, while heavy grown steers to slaughter sold to 268c/kg. Lighter 2 score bullocks returning to the paddocks sold to 247c, while similar bullocks to feed sold to 242c/kg. The significantly less numbers of heavy cows saw values lift by 4c to 7c on last sale, however lighter cows lifted up to 15c/kg to both restockers and one processor. Heavy 3 score cows to slaughter averaged 224c, selling to 229c, while heavy 2 score cows sold to 231c for an increased average of 218c/kg. Light 1 and 2 score cows to processors sold to 228c, while similar cows to restockers averaged 216c, selling to 218c/kg on multiple occasions. Good numbers of bulls were again on offer, with quality much improved on last sale, however many were of similar light condition. Heavy 3 score bulls to slaughter sold to 206c to average 197c, while medium weight bulls to feed sold to 228c/kg. Some individual sales of bulls for breeding sold to 298c/kg. Light bulls to restockers sold to 402c/kg. There were no cows and calves this week."
"Smaller numbers and some better quality cattle saw values increase across the board. All the regular buyers were in attendance although not all purchased stock with some processors inactive. Steers mostly gained 3c to 4c and some lighter weights improved up to 15c/kg. The cows were 7c and 8c/kg dearer. 

Light steers sold to 121.2c and averaged 114.1c/kg. The good quality medium weight steers reached 135c and they averaged just under 130c while the poorer grades saw most sales around 117c/kg. Heavy steers reached 135.2c to average 133.7c and the heavy bullocks topped at 136.2c/kg. 

The cow market sold to strong competition and the lightweights made to 105.2c and the D2s averaged 96.4c/kg. The medium weight cows sold to 118.2c and most averaged 113.4c/kg. Heavy bulls reached 124.6c/kg."
"Similar to other yards, a smaller yarding of export types was penned at Charters Towers. Also similar to other centres, mixed results were received by most categories. All the usual buyers were present, although not all were in operation. The quality of the yarding was reported as plainer with most of the offering not properly finished. 

The light steers were in small numbers, as D3 medium weights topped at 148.6c to average 139.9c/kg. The top price for the steers was for the heavy D3s reaching 149.2c/kg. 

All of the heifers weighed under 540kg, as the D3s fell over 10c to average 119c after reaching a top of 135.2c/kg. Cows on the other hand, met increased demand, as the light D2s improved 5c and the medium weight D3s improved 4c/kg. The heavy D3 types also realised a gain after topping at 126.2c/kg.

The medium weight bulls sold to 124.2c, as heavy weights sold to 138.2c to return over $1,100/head."
"Similar to other centres around the state, a smaller yarding was offered with the cheaper prices of recent weeks and limited numbers in the supply area the major reason for this. The quality of the yarding was affected by the current dry season with increased numbers of cattle being offered. Not all the regular buyers made purchases, but there was some good competition from local butchers. 

The better medium weight steers reached 182.2c with others selling to 176.2c/kg. The top of the heavy steers sold to 192.2c/kg and returned over $1,000/head. The few light heifers that were offered sold to solid demand as the C3s made to 190.2c/kg. 

The light cows dominated the yarding and despite this still managed to improve up to 9c after selling to 158.2c/kg. The medium and heavy cows suffered further falls, but the heavy weights still topped at 172.2c/kg. 

As has been the case at a few other centres the light bulls were in large numbers. Both the light and medium weights sold to 162.2c/kg."
"Sale numbers lifted by 278 head to 2,336 head this week for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents, with increased numbers of yearling steers and heifers accompanied by a good selection of well finished cows. The absence of one regular processor saw values ease for heavy cows and bullocks while live exporters were intermittently present on suitable types. Feeder buyers were active and competed strongly on while restockers competed on lighter yearlings and vealers. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Croydon, Einasleigh, Richmond, Hughenden, Greenvale, Tully, Ingham, Woodstock, Ravenswood, local and coastal areas.

Vealer heifers were of mixed quality and sold slightly easier, topping at 334.2c and averaging 321.3c/kg, predominantly to restockers. Several large lines of yearling heifers attracted strong feeder interest, with restockers active on lighter types. Heifers to feed sold to 332.2c, averaging 304.6c, while heifers to restockers sold to 326.2c for an average of 313.6c/kg. Vealer steers were fewer in number and sold easier on recent sales to a reduced restocker panel of buyers, topping at 368.2c, to average 358.7c/kg.  Yearling steers were in strong demand from feeder buyers, underpinned by demand from restockers for lighter weights. Yearling steers to feed sold to 350.2c, to average 348.6c, while lighter lesser conditioned types to restockers sold to 362.2c, to average 354.8c/kg. 

Grown steers sold to 350c, averaging 316.5c for feeder weight lines, while restockers pushed values for better quality backgrounders to 351c/kg.  Bullocks sold 3c to 9c easier on last sale, with best 3 score bullocks to slaughter selling to 293.2c to average 271.3c/kg. A continued large yarding of prime cows saw values ease, most notably for heavier types by 3c to 16c, with heavy C3 cows selling to 247.2c, to average 233.3c/kg. 2 score cows for slaughter sold to 261.2c, for an average of 235.4c/kg. Lighter 2 score cows restockers sold to 227.2c, averaging 212.6c/kg. Heavy heifers sold easier on recent sales, with slaughter types topping at 290.2c, while an increased number of heifers to feed topped at 330.2c/kg. A very good selection of heavy bulls attracted interest from a live export buyer and sold to 268.2c/kg. Processors pushed values to 264.2c/kg for heavy slaughter bulls. Lighter bulls to feed destined for live export sold to 330.2c/kg. A good number of cows and calves were on offer, regularly selling above $1,300 to a top of $1,500/unit."

"Recent wet weather across the north resulted in a reduced yarding of 1,154 head drawn by Charters Towers Selling Agents this week, with a mixed quality yarding dominated by some well finished northern cows and some very good small lines of quality vealer steers and heifers. All major northern processors were in attendance, along with a live exporter and recent regular western restockers. Two southern processors were notably absent, with medium and light weight cows 10c to 20c/kg easier, while heavy cows and bullocks were 5c to 8c/kg easier. Cattle were drawn from Burketown, Croydon, Georgetown, Einasleigh, Hughenden and Woodstock, with recent local rain preventing supply of many local cattle.

"Recent dry conditions led to a plain quality yarding, resulting in significant numbers of cattle needing to be supplementary fed.  Unlike most southern markets, an increased yarding was offered.  Most stock came from the north and west and all the usual buyers were present and operating, including three major processors. Competition was steady and the market sold to a firm trend. 

Good quality lighter steers were in limited number and ranged from 130.2c to 144.2c/kg. The better end of the medium steers averaged 164.6c, some C3’s selling to a top of 167.2c/kg. Heavy steers topped the sale at 170.2c/kg. Export heifers were in limited numbers and most sales were around 126c/kg. 

Cows were present in large numbers with some better quality lines offered. D3 lightweights sold to 145.2c with most sales at 135c/kg. Medium weight cows were of mixed quality with some good C3s selling to 156.2c as D3s, which were in the majority, averaged 144.2c/kg."
"Quality was noticeably poorer compared to last sale as the number of well finished cattle in the region dwindles. Despite this market trends were dearer for grown steers as all the regular buyers competed but a cheaper trend cold not be prevented on grown heifers, cows and bulls. 

Light grown steers ranged from 170c to 183.2c with occasional runs of heavy pens averaging 189c/kg. Grown heifer prices reflected the quality on offer and slipped to average 155c/kg. 

Light cows accounted for a large majority of numbers, these included a number of poor conditioned stock. Prices eased to average 148.3c while medium weights averaged 164c after reaching 175.2c/kg. There were very few heavy cows offered. Bull quality was poor and prices reflected this by easing for all weights."
"Quality was noticeably better than the previous sale as last weeks dearer trend enticed more cattle onto the market. Storms are threatening on the district but no significant rain has yet eventuated. Despite the better quality and good competition from restockers, all grades sold to cheaper levels as the major processors operated at reduced rates. 

Medium weight grown steers comprised the majority of the steer yarding, they ranged from 167.2c to 195c with occasional heavy sales reaching 206.2c/kg. Light, unfinished types averaged 161.4c/kg while heifers also sold to cheaper rates. 

No heavy cows were yarded but medium weights averaged 170.6c after reaching 179.2c/kg. Light D3 cows ranged from 132.2c to 168.2c while plain, unfinished cows sold mostly at 119.8c/kg. Bulls sold to reduced rates."
"Quality was mixed across the yarding with some excellent pens of bullocks offset by a much plainer cow yarding. All the usual export buyers were present and hotly contested the suitable lines to send the market on a dearer trend to last sale. Store descriptions continued to sell well with plainer cows and bullocks achieving good returns. 

Grown steers comprised a large percentage of the total yarding with medium weights ranging from 156.2c to 172c to average 166.7c/kg. Heavier lines topped at 177.2c to average 173c/kg. Bullocks were of reasonable quality and were rewarded accordingly, ranging from 165.2c to 178.2c to average 176c/kg. 

Cows attracted keen interest from all exporters with both good and plain quality types achieving good returns. Light D3s averaged 141.8c after reaching 151.2c while medium weights of similar condition averaged 149.8c/kg. Bulls improved for all weights with the better conditioned heavy weights topping at 158.2c/kg."
"Quality improved and numbers increased by 1,121 head to 3,541 cattle in Charters Towers where records tumbled in a demand driven market. Some good lines of local bullocks and cows saw values increase on recent weeks, while some large lines of very good quality light steers and heifers saw records tumble. Values for prime cattle increase by 15c to 20c and restocker categories improved by up to 70c on recent weeks. All regular processors were in attendance and operating with strong demand supported by one live exporter regular feeder buyers and several western and southern restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Doomadgee, Normanton, Greenvale, Ravenswood, local and coastal areas.

Light steer calves to back grounders reached 505.2c and heifer calves sold to 420.2c with a large sample of mixed sex calves averaging an astonishing 436c/kg. Light vealer steers to restockers sold to 490.2c to average from 454c to 485c, with steers above 280kg to restockers averaging 412c/kg. Vealer heifers to processors topped at 385.2c to average from 375c to 378c, while restocker lines averaged from 340c to 363c/kg. Yearling steers returning to grass made to 362.2c to average 332c, with feeder steers averaging from 335c to 364c/kg. Yearling heifers met continued strong demand increasing by 16c to 18c, selling to 366c to average from 321c to 352c/kg. Heavy grown steers to feed sold to 350.2c to average the same, while processors secured a small number to 347c/kg. Heavy grown heifers to the trade sold to 328.2c to average from 270c to 296c/kg. Heavy bullocks improved by 5c to 15c, with those to export slaughter selling to 377.2c with most sales from 364c to 374c/kg. 

An Increased number of cows met very strong demand from all processors, with heavy cows increasing by 16c to 18c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows sold to 280.2c to average 262c and 3 scores sold to 312.2c to average above 289c/kg. Prime heavy weight 4 score cows made to 318c/kg. Cows to western restockers sold to 260c averaging 235c to 246c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export reached 338.2c to average 317c to 327c while feeder weights reached 360.2c to average 309c to 335c/kg. Young males returning to grass sold to 492.2c to average 379c/kg. A small number of cows and calves sold from $1260 to $1700/unit."
"Prime numbers remained limited although there were 785 store cattle also offered.  Grown steers, bullocks and grown heifers were limited with the majority of the penning consisting of light and medium weight cows.  Two major export processors were present along with several local butchers and competition was firm across most categories.

Grown steers and bullocks were slightly cheaper, however this was partly due to the plainer quality offered.  Most of the better C muscled pens made from 153.2¢ to 170.2¢/kg.  Grown heifers also eased slightly and most of the D muscled lines made from 124.2¢ to 130.2¢/kg.

Cow quotes fell under restricted competing and most of the D2s and D3s made from 119.2¢ to 138.2¢ with some heavy 4 score cows selling to 159.2¢/kg."
"Prime cattle numbers increased slightly for a similar sized yarding. There were some good pens of bullocks and cows offered which helped lift the overall quality of the sale. All the regular export buyers were present plus one processor not seen for a number of weeks. Export grades sold to a slightly easier trend with the better lines of steers and well conditioned cows achieving firm to slightly higher rates.

Medium and heavy weight grown steers comprised the majority of the yarding. Medium weights ranged from 151.2c to 160.2c to average 157.3c/kg. The heavier lines reached 167.2c after averaging 165.1c/kg. 

Cow quality was fair to good. Lightweights ranged from 125.2c to 134.2c to average 128.9c/kg. Large lines of medium weight D3s averaged 139.1c after reaching a top of 148.2c/kg. The best bull price was 126.2c for a heavy weight description."
Only a handful of prime cattle were offered. Major exporters are still not in operation in the region. Numbers were too few to gain a reliable quote.
"Once again, and as expected for this time of year, a smaller yarding was offered. The steers suffer losses while some cow classes were able to regain the losses of last week. Most of the usual local and export buyers were present.

The steers were reported to be of plainer quality and combine this with a missing buyer, the light weights were dealt the greatest falls for the sale. The medium weights sold to 148.2c, as large numbers of heavy steers and bullocks held firm after reaching 166.2c/kg. 

Large numbers of light heifers were offered, as the D3s sold to 148.2c/kg. The cows sold to strong competition, with lightweight D2s selling to 118.2c/kg. The top of the cows was the medium weight D3s reaching 138.2c/kg. 

Bulls were in reduced numbers and this allowed the medium and heavy weights to receive further gains."
"On the back of two sales last week, the supply of cattle reduced for a yarding of 2970 in a Combined Prime and Store sale.  Despite some good lines of heavy prime  bullocks and cows, quality was not as good as recent weeks,, comprising of an increased number of plain conditioned cows and heifers along with an increased supply of northern males. All regular processors were in attendance and operating, supported by one live exporter, one feeder and opportunity restockers.  Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Richmond, Georgetown, Ayr, local and coastal areas.

Demand for heavy prime cattle and best quality feeders was good, however lesser quality and plain conditioned  light cattle struggled to attract buyer support. Heavy bullocks lifted 10c, grown steers and heifers fell 6c to 20c, medium weight cows averaged 7c lower, heavy cows 11c to 16c easier and bulls to live export were firm to 12c to 14c higher.

Good quality vealer steers returning to grass averaged 284c selling to 302c, similar heifers to restockers made 200c/kg. Yearling steers above 200kg to backgrounders sold to 256c to average 221c, steers above 280kg returning to the paddock averaged 247c and steers above 330kg sold to 282c to average 279c/kg. Best quality yearling heifers above 280kg to feed sold to 222c to average 210c, with a very good quality large line of heifers above 330kg to feed selling to 268c to average 260c/kg. A good sample of heifers above 400kg to feed averaged 263c and processor types averaged 282c/kg.

Grown steers above 400kg to processors averaged 256c to 266c, selling to 272c, steers suitable for live export made to 304c.  Grown heifers to the trade made to 262c to average 241c/kg.  A good sample of heavy full mouthed bulls to export slaughter topped at 315c to average 292c to 314c and bullocks to live export reached 310c to average 299c to 310c/kg. 

Lightweight cows to restockers sold to 192c to average 188c, while 2 scores to processors sold to 220c to average 180c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows reached 230c to average 200c, 3 scores sold to 262c to average 245c/kg. Prime heavyweight 3 and 4 score cows topped at 278c, averaging from 260c to 268c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export sold to 286c, most selling from 260c to 276c/kg. Bulls to processors averaged 227c to 254c/kg.

A small number of cows and calves sold to $650 per unit.

Market Reporter, Mick Kingham"
"Numbers were up slightly in a similar quality yarding. Consistent runs of fair quality bullocks were offered and there were large runs of cows, which sold to a full gallery of the regular buyers. Processors purchased the majority of the offering with local butchers and traders securing the remainder. The quality and competition saw all grades sell to a dearer market with plainer types also securing good rates. 

Lightweight export steers sold to a top of 139.2c to average 115.8c/kg. Medium and heavy bullocks enjoyed stronger competition to improve for both grades. Medium bullocks ranged from 150.2c to 159.2c to average 152.1c while heavier weights averaged 159.2c/kg. Grown heifers achieved higher rates of 130.7c after reaching a top of 139.2c/kg.

Cow quality was consistent over the large lines of medium weight cows penned. Medium D3 s ranged from 127.2c to 142.2c to average 135c/kg. Bulls also enjoyed price gains to reach a top of 135.2c/kg for heavy weight descriptions."
"Numbers were up slightly and quality was slightly plainer than the last sale. The continuing dry climate is making it difficult for producers to market cattle with sufficient condition. A feature of the sale were some excellent quality grown steers and bullocks that had been finished on grain and came from the coastal regions that sold to keen interest. However most sales experienced weaker demand from a full field of the regular buyers, although not all participated. 

Lightweights made up a fair percentage of the grown steer yarding, they sold to 149.2c to average 144.6c/kg. Medium weights averaged 170.1c with occasional supplementary fed descriptions reaching 196.2c/kg. Heavy steers reached up to 197.2c on individual occasions with most sales at 185.5c/kg. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper market, averaging between 147.1c and 154.5c/kg. 

Cow demand was weaker as lightweights lost value to average 144.8c/kg. Medium weight D3 also slipped to range from 140.2c to 174.2c, however some heavy cow sales reached 180.2c/kg. Competition on bulls was weaker for them to sell at cheaper levels."
"Numbers were up in a much better quality yarding of well-finished cattle. Trade cattle were non-existent in a yarding of mostly export categories. The return of one processor buyer helped maintain strong competition as all other regular buyers were also present.

Grown steers were mostly present in the medium weights, these were contested by processors and local butcher operators. The majority D3s ranged from 129.2¢ to 149.2¢ to sell mostly at 141.5¢/kg. Heifers eased slightly to averaged 110.5¢/kg.

The cow yarding sold to a mostly firm market with medium weight D3s making the best money of 120¢/kg. Bulls sold to a top of 117.2¢/kg."
"Numbers were similar to last sale with 2,585 mostly prime cattle presented this week with more than 2,600 booked for a store sale on Friday. Some very good lines of prime cows and bullocks were presented along with increased numbers of heavy bulls. All regular processors were in attendance and operating, supported by two live exporters and feeder buyers operating at increased rates on last sale. Bullocks improved by 7c, heavy cows lifted by 11c to 20c and heavy bulls improved by 5c to 8c/kg. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Normanton, Richmond, Pentland, Ingham, Townsville, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

A small number of heavy vealer steers to feed made 360.2c and vealer heifers to processors sold to 380.2c to average 366c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed sold firm to 20c dearer, topping at 338.2c to average 334c and grown heifers to feed also made 338.2c to average 294c/kg. Grown heifers to the trade sold to 324.2c to average 276c/kg. Limited numbers of yearling steers to feed sold to 365.2c/kg. Grown steers to live export sold to 339.2c to average 328c and heavy steers above 400kg to feed topped at 365.2c to average 355c/kg. Heavy bullocks to live export topped at 345.2c to average 340c and processor lines averaged 341c/kg.  

Medium weight 2 score cows lifted 3c, selling to 266c to average 248c and 3 scores sold to 290.2c to average 266c/kg. Prime heavy weight cows sold to 280.2c to average 278c/kg. Increased numbers of heavy bulls to live export topped at 342.2c, with most sales from 330c to 338c/kg. Feeder weight males to feed destined for live export averaged from 280c to 320c/kg."
"Numbers were reduced following the larger yarding penned last week. Just under half of the yarding was store cattle as the supply area hays off very quickly. The lack of body of feed is impacting on quality and yield of the cattle. The regular exporters and trade buyers were in operation with values holding on rather well considering the cheaper markets of recent weeks. 

Light grown steers averaged from 129c to 139c/kg. Most of the steers offered were medium weights, which sold to 151.2c and averaged 146.2c/kg. Heavy steers remained firm after selling to 155.2c while good bullocks reached 157.2c/kg for the limited numbers available. 

A fair number of cows were also offered as prices held firm to slightly cheaper. Light D2s averaged 116c as plainer lines averaged closer to 94c/kg. The large number of D3s held firm at 127.5c after selling to 133.2c/kg."
"Numbers were reduced again and values followed the trend of other markets to be mixed. Quality too was varied with a portion of each category in plain condition. Steers and bullocks dominated the market. 

Light grown steers made to 143.2c to average 141.5c/kg. The better medium weights suited to the Korean market topped at 158.2c as plainer muscled lines averaged from 135c to 146c/kg. Heavy weights reached 162.2c as a large number of heavy bullocks averaged 161c/kg. Only a handful of export heifers were yarded with most selling firm to slightly dearer. 

Most of cows offered were lightweights as heavy weights were almost non existent. Light D2s sold to 118.2c to average 116.1c as a small number of D3s averaged 120.4c/kg. A fair number of plain E muscled light cows averaged 73.1c/kg. Medium weights made to an isolated 136.2c as heavy weights reached 147.2c/kg."
"Numbers were once again capped due to live exporter bookings of yard space, where 2,481 cattle were penned, 1,056 fewer than last sale. Two regular processors were absent, however one major processor returned to the buyer gallery, accompanied by two live exporters, feeder buyers with several local and western restockers. With the reduced yarding there were fewer numbers of heavy prime cows, however some very good pens of cows and bullocks were on offer imoproving by 3c to 12c, supported by some excellent young light weight cattle attracting strong demand. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Normanton, Georgetown, Ingham, Home Hill, local and coastal areas.

Increased numbers of steer calves continued to attract strong restocker demand selling to 439.2c, to average 409c, with heifer calves to processors topping at 388.2c to average 370c/kg. Vealer steers returning to the paddock sold to 394.2c, to average 390c, while steers to feed averaged from 335c to 340c/kg.  Vealer heifers to processors topped at 386.2c, to average 355c/kg. Yearling steers above 280kg to restockers sold to 376.2c, to average 364c/kg and steers above 330kg to feed sold to 362.2c, to average from 336c to 339c/kg. Yearling steers to processors sold to 320.2c to average 319c/kg. Mixed quality yearling heifers to feed sold to 348.2c, to average 308c to 324c/kg. Grown steers consisted of considerable variation in quality, with better bred pens to feed selling to 340.2c, to average 313c, while heavy steers to the trade sold to 340.2c, to average 329c/kg. Some good lines of prime grown heifers to the trade topped at 299.2c, to average from 275c to 295c, while medium weights to feed reached 338.2c, to average from 266c to 302c/kg.

Some excellent pens of heavy export bullocks to export slaughter sold to 340.2c, to average from 322c to 336c, with suitable pens to live export selling to 333c to average 329c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows to processors sold to 249.2c, to average 236c, with 3 score cows reaching 274.2c multiple times to average from 256c to 273c/kg. Prime heavy weight cows sold for 284c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export topped at 332c, to average above 318c, with heavy bulls to processors sold to 334c, and averaged 333c/kg. Feeder weight bulls destined for live export sold to 326.2c, to average from 260c to 315c/kg.

A small number of cows and calves sold from $920 to 1,320/unit."
"Numbers were drawn from a wide area for a reduced quality offering. Light and unfinished descriptions dominated both steer and cow yardings. Despite this, competition was strong for the right article from a full field of the regular buyers plus one extra buyer. Most grown steers sold to good demand and achieved price gains, light cows eased while well-finished cows sold to dearer levels. 

Runs of lightweight D3s averaged 142.6c after reaching 150c/kg. Medium weights ranged from 182.2c to 195c with occasional heavy weight sales reaching 195.2c/kg. The limited number of grown heifers present sold to mostly dearer levels.

Cows sold to mixed demand with lighter grades easing and medium and heavy weights improving. Large runs of light D3 types averaged 145c to top at 167.2c/kg. Similar description medium and heavy types ranged from 135.2c to 178.2c with most sales around 170.5c/kg. Bull quality was mixed but most sold at dearer rates."
"Numbers were back slightly in a similar quality yarding. Consistent runs of good quality bullocks were hard to come by but there were large runs of cows offered, which sold to a full gallery of the regular buyers. Processors purchased the majority of the offering with local butchers and traders securing the remainder. The extra quality and competition saw all grades sell to a dearer market. 

Lightweight export steers sold to a top of 125.2c to average 118.3c/kg. Medium and heavy steers and bullocks enjoyed stronger competition to improve for both grades. Medium bullocks ranged from 130c to 147.2c to average 142.7c while heavier weights averaged 144c after topping at 148.2c/kg. Grown heifers maintained firm rates of 120.2c after reaching a top of 134.2c/kg.

Cow quality was consistent over the large lines of medium weight cows penned. Medium D3 s ranged from 124.2c to 148.2c to average 137c/kg. Bulls also enjoyed price gains to reach a top of 128.2c/kg for heavy weight descriptions."
"Numbers were back slightly in a better quality yarding. Large consistent runs of good quality bullocks and cows sold to a full gallery of the regular buyers plus one extra export operator. Processors purchased the majority of the offering with local butchers and traders securing the remainder. The extra quality and competition saw all grades sell to a dearer market. 

Lightweight export steers sold to a cheaper market to average 107.9c/kg. Medium and heavy bullocks enjoyed stronger competition to improve for both grades. Medium bullocks ranged from 130c to 151.2c to average 143c while heavier weights averaged 153.3c after topping at 156.2c/kg. Grown heifers maintained firm rates of 128.6c after reaching a top of 131.2c/kg.

Cow quality was consistent over the large lines of medium weight cows penned. Medium D3 s ranged from 117.2c to 129.2c to average 125.7c while the plainer 2 scores averaged 116.8c/kg. Bulls also enjoyed price gains to reach a top of 123.2c/kg for lightweight descriptions."
"Numbers were back for a smaller fair quality yarding. A full panel of buyers were operating including one processor who has not been present for the last 18 months. Cattle were sourced from as far as the Gulf and a single processor purchased the majority of the offering.

Steers sold to strong competition and reached a top of 192.2c, the majority were medium weights and they sold mostly to 179c/kg. Heifers averaged 141c/kg.

Some good C2 drafts were offered along with very plain runs of E1 cows. The better lightweights made to 156.2c, medium weights averaged between 145c and 157c/kg. Heavy cows made to 163.2c/kg. A heavy C1 bull sold at 152.2c/kg."
"Numbers returned to similar of the previous fortnight following insufficient numbers last week for a yarding of 2,351 mixed quality cattle in very hot temperatures in Charters Towers. Some good quality heavy lines of prime cows and bullocks were on offer, accompanied by several lines of prime and store cattle showing the effects of the ever increasing dry season. One major processor was absent and similar to southern markets, prices for all prime cattle eased considerably. One live exporter and several opportunity restockers and backgrounders operated selectively on many lines sourced from Mt Isa, Hughenden, Muttaburra, Mt Garnet, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

Mixed sex calves saw quality related price changes, while good quality vealer steers improved with spirited demand on selected pens. Vealer heifers softened across all categories, particularly lighter lesser quality lines by more than 30c and mixed quality yearling heifers to restockers sold 55c to 70c/kg lower. Yearling steers to feed and restockers eased by 20c to 40c and all grown steers to feed and backgrounders saw prices ease by 35c to 55c/kg. Select pens of good quality grown heifers to feeders improved by 50c, however heavy heifers to the trade eased by 40c to 50c/kg. Many lines of mixed quality plain bullocks met limited demand, with a small number of heavy export bullocks easing more than 50c/kg on previous sale. Medium weight cows to processor eased more than 30c and heavy 3 and 4 score cows sold more than 50c/kg lower. Bulls to feed destined for live export eased by 25c to 30c/kg.

Good quality vealer steers sold to 316c and heavier types made to 308c, with lesser quality lines averaging 268c/kg. Better lines of vealer heifers to restockers sold to 215c, while a good sample of heavy heifers to live export sold for 264c/kg. Yearling steers varied in quality and weight, resulting in selective buyer interest. Light weight steers to restockers topped at 190c, while steers above 280kg to feed sold to 269c to average 240c and plainer types returning to grass topped at 290c to average 265c/kg. Light grown steers to feed or background sold from 256c to 262c and those returning to the paddocks sold to 244c, for an average of 242c/kg. Light yearling heifers to feed sold to 185c with quality lines returning to grass topping at 198c, while heavy heifers above 400kg to feed made 225c/kg. Grown heifers to feed sold from 206c to 210c and heavy heifers to the trade sold to 229c/kg.

A small number of heavy 4 score bullocks to export slaughter sold to 260c to average 256, with many plainer types to feed selling from 250c to 254c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows to processors sold to 148c to average 128c and heavy 3 score cows topped at 189c to average 181c/kg. Extra heavy 3 score cows topped at 197c and 4 scores sold to 189c to average 187c/kg. Cows returning to grass sold to 147c to average 126c/kg. Heavy bulls to feed destined for live export sold from 254c to 275c, with heavy bulls to processor selling from 210c to 212c/kg. Young males to restockers and backgrounders sold to 296c, to average 278c/kg."
"Numbers remained similar to last week although there is less supply than the beginning of 2001. The late wet season has been cited as one reason behind the lower numbers, and true trends in the market will not become apparent until all northern processors are operating.  Rain is needed and there is a growing concern amongst producers regarding pasture and water availability. 

Only a handful of steers were penned and Korean weight D2s topped at 179.2c/kg. Cows made up the bulk of the yarding and prices were mixed. The lighter weights sold on a dearer trend and D2s topped at 117.2c to average 113.1c/kg. The majority of medium weights were in fair condition but lost 10c to average 122.9c/kg. There was an insufficient number of bulls to provide and accurate quote."
"Numbers remained relatively small and not all buyers were in attendance. Quality overall was mixed. Processor competition was very strong and as a result prices were well above last week and the state average.

"Numbers remained firm in a plain quality yarding. Recent poor seasonal conditions have meant that quality has been lower than usual for this time of year. All the usual buyers were present including three major processors and some local butchers.

Steers were well represented, particularly the medium and heavy weights and they sold to a top of 169.2c/kg. Heifers ranged from 91.2c to 120.2c averaging around 105c/kg.

"Numbers remained close to last week and values improved substantially as the regular field of buyers competed strongly. The best cattle were of quite a good standard while the balance of the yarding was reported to taper off in finish. The light steers gained 3c to 7c while the medium weights improved up to 14c/kg. The heavy steers gained 4c to 7c/kg. The heifers were 1c to 8c dearer while the cows improved 8c to 13c/kg.

"Numbers reduced slightly and quality was good for this time of year. Of all the buyers present only one meatworks operated with whatever leftover being bought by local butchers. As a result of the weaker competition values eased for all grades.

Grown steers were evenly spread across all weight ranges with lightweights averaging between 142.3c and 155.7c/kg. Medium weights averaged 160.1c after topping at 180c/kg. Grown heifers in limited numbers sold to weaker rates.

Cows slipped for medium D3s in the majority to average 139.2c and the small selection of bulls sold to a cheaper market."
"Numbers reduced on a fortnight ago by 558 for a yarding of 986 cattle.  Quality was very mixed, comprising of some good quality pens of heavy cows and a good line of grown steers, while there were many smaller mixed quality light lines.

"Numbers lifted by 612 head to 2376 cattle this week with quality generally good throughout.  The increased supply saw most categories ease in price particularly on lesser quality lines.  Some very good large lines of prime cows and young steers met strong competition.  Four regular processors operated selectively along with regular feeders, backgrounders and restockers. Cattle were drawn from Richmond, Pentland, Greenvale, Ayr, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

"Numbers lifted by 600 for a yarding of 2028 cattle.  Quality was very mixed with some well finished pens of cows and bullocks, along with an increased number of northern bulls and small mixed lines of store steers and heifers. A full panel of processors returned which helped demand along with two live exporters, regular feeders and opportunity restockers.. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Georgetown and south to the local area.

Values firmed for light steers and heifers by 14c to 24c yearling steers below 280kg eased 20c to 34c, yearling heifers to feed fell 27c, bullocks lifted 6c to 16c, cows improved 6c and bulls were firm.

"Numbers lifted by 430 head to 2,047 cattle for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, with fewer numbers of prime bullocks on offer, and prime cows of mixed quality, however two large lines of vealer and yearling steer attracted strong attention from a large buyer gallery. All processors were in attendance, with one previously absent very active in the market for slaughter cattle, while two live exporters, regular feeder buyers and central restockers ensured strong competition throughout the offering. Cattle were drawn from Burketown, Richmond, Mt Garnet, Einasleigh, Ingham, Woodstock, Ravenswood, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steer numbers increased substantially and were of very good quality, which also featured one large line, displaying very good quality and condition, selling to 323c averaging 311c to restockers, while live exporters secured feeder weight types to 308c/kg. Yearling steers also met spirited bidding from the gallery, selling to 322c for those returning to grass, while those to feed sold to 316c to average 310c/kg. Live exporters were very active throughout, securing lines to 308c averaging 306c for lighter feeders and 288c/kg for heavier feeder steers. Vealer heifers met mixed demand for a generally good quality offering of smaller lines selling 7c to 10c higher on last sale, with live exporters securing heavier types to 268c, while larger framed types with condition to feed sold to 266c/kg. Younger, lighter heifers returning to grass sold to 256c/kg. Yearling heifers were in greater supply and sold 10c to 14c higher on last sale with feeder weight heifers to live export sold to 258c multiple times, with restockers securing similar weight lines to 254c to average 252c/kg. Bullock numbers were greatly reduced from recent weeks and the mixed offering met subdued demand easing 10c to 15c, primarily influenced by quality with the few heavy bullocks to slaughter selling to 240c/kg. Lighter conditioned types to feed sold to 250c, while a small number of grown steers to feed reached 240c/kg. 

Grown heifers to live export sold to 250c, with a small number to slaughter making 244c/kg. Heavy grown steers to live export sold to 260c, with feeder weight steers selling to 306c averaging 266c/kg.

"Numbers lifted by 1542 for a yarding of 3487 cattle in a combined prime and store sale.  Quality was mixed, with more than 1000 cows penned, there were fewer numbers of good heavy prime cows and bullocks, supported by some very good lines of steers and heifers.  One additional southern processor and a central processor joined the buyer panel, which operated selectively throughout.  One feeder was notably absent, while opportunity feeder orders and local restockers provided some valuable competition. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Mt Garnet and south to local area.

"Numbers lifted by 134 head to 1,868 cattle for Charter Towers Combined Selling Agents this week comprising of some well finished cows and large northern lines of mixed quality cattle. One regular processor continued their absence, with all other processors selective throughout the offering of prime cattle, while regular feeder buyers and local restockers showed subdued demand for some lesser quality types. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Croydon, Einasleigh, Hughenden, Prairie, Tully, Ingham, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were in greater supply with competition strong throughout, topping at 340c/kg returning to grass. Yearling steers were of mixed quality with feeder buyers securing most lines, topping at 294c to average 281c/kg. Vealer heifers varied in quality with better, well conditioned types making to 280c to average 262c/kg. Yearling heifers were also of variable quality, but in strong demand, with heifers to feed selling to 278c to average 273c, while those returning to grass sold to 282c to average 260c/kg. A large number of grown heifers to feed sold to 273c to average 259c, while a few heavy heifers to slaughter sold to 241c/kg.

One large line of good quality young cows with calves (1-4mth) sold for $1,230/unit."
"Numbers increased slightly however it was weaker competition that caused most categories to loose ground. The poorest stock was most affected in a yarding that had fair numbers of most grades available. Fair quality steers eased slightly while the lesser grades were well below the levels of last week. Heifers and cows were up to 19c cheaper in places, although the better conditioned cows were around 2c/kg cheaper. 

Light steers topped at 120c although most averaged 105c/kg. There were a good number of medium weights offered and they topped at 140.2c, though the bulk were D2s that averaged 111c/kg. Heavy steers peaked at 140.2c ad over 80 head averaged 137.2c/kg. 

Most heifers sold around 94c and one isolated sale was recorded at 131.2c/kg. Light cows of poorest quality averaged 55c while the D2s topped at 105.2c and averaged 91.4c/kg. Medium weights reached 112.2c and the D3s averaged 110.2c/kg. Bulls peaked at 107c/kg."
"Numbers increased slightly and quality was mixed with some lines reflecting the dry seasonal conditions.  The penning mainly consisted of store cattle that were sold in the open auction section with only a limited number of grown steers, heifers and bullocks penned.  Cows were once again well supplied and all the regular buyers were present and competition was firm to slightly stronger across most grades. 

Grown steers and bullocks were firm to slightly dearer as local trade operators competed strongly against each other to capture adequate numbers.  Most of the better C muscled pens made from 149.2¢ to 167.2¢/kg.  There were insufficient numbers of grown heifers to quote, however the D3 lightweight lines made up to 156.2¢/kg.  

Light weight cows were firm to slightly easier; however the better medium and heavy weight lines rose by 1¢ to 3¢/kg.  The D3 medium weight pens averaged 126.1¢ while heavy 4 score cows sold up to 140¢/kg."
"Numbers increased quite substantially and there was a greater proportion of the penning suitable for processors.  There was a reasonable selection of medium and heavy grown steers along with several large pens of bullocks offered.  The majority of the cows were 2 and 3 scores and there were very few heavy weights penned.  There were several export processors operating along with a few local trade buyers.

Medium and heavy grown steers were 6¢ to 7¢/kg cheaper as processors were able to be more selective on the pens that they acquired.  Bullocks had similar price corrections and most of the C3s and C4s made from 152.2¢ to 168.2¢/kg.  Grown heifers fell by 9¢ and the D3s topped at 147.2¢/kg.

The D2 lines averaged 113.3¢ while the D3 medium weight grades averaged 127.4¢/kg.  Heavy cows topped at 143.2¢ and bulls were also cheaper and sold up to 119.2¢/kg."
"Numbers increased quite substantially and quality varied across all grades.  The majority of the penning was sold in the open auction section with only a small selection offered in the live weight section.  The penning mainly consisted of grown steers and heifers along with a reasonable selection of bullocks and cows.  The regular field of export processors and local trade buyers were present and competition was a little weaker across most grades.

Grown steers and bullocks were mainly medium and heavy weights and most pens eased by 2¢ to 6¢ with odd sales falling by as much as 11¢/kg.  The majority of the C3s and C4s made from 147.2¢ to 160.2¢/kg.  Grown heifers fell by 10¢ to 14¢/kg and the D3 pens averaged 120.3¢/kg.

"Numbers increased however competition was strong from a full field of buyers. There were some top quality bullocks available that sold well while the heavy steers were well represented and improved slightly. The medium weight steers eased 3c/kg. Heifers were mostly 3c dearer while the cows varied 3c/kg either side of firm apart from the very poor quality lightweights that were well below last weeks rates.

The light steers sold to 143.2c and over 100 head averaged 135.8c/kg. There were some poorer quality grades that averaged around 121c/kg. The heavy steers sold to 150.2c and close to 150 head averaged 143.6c/kg. Heavy bullocks reached 150.2c also and they averaged 143.2c/kg and returned up to $1,032/head. 

The majority of the heifers averaged 113c although the better end made to 128c/kg. The poor quality light cows averaged 65.2c and a large number averaged 109.7c after they reached 118.2c/kg.

Heavy bulls sold to 140.6c/kg and some returned up to $1,012/head."
"Numbers increased for the second consecutive week and quality also improved.  A larger percentage of the penning was suitable for processors compared to the previous market and grown steers, bullocks and cows made up the majority of the yarding.  Three major export processors were present along with the regular field of trade buyers and restockers.

Grown steers and bullocks were difficult to quote due to the lack of numbers offered in the previous market, however most lines were firm.  The C muscled pens made from 151.2¢ to 160.2¢/kg.  Grown heifers were also firm and the D3s topped at 160.2¢/kg.

All weights and grades of cows were fully firm to slightly dearer except for a few heavy pens, which were firm to slightly easier.  The D3 medium weights averaged 133¢ while the heavy D4 cows sold up to 147.2¢/kg."
"Numbers increased for the last sale of the year and values were mixed. Not all buyers were in attendance and competition was weak. Quality varied although most were generally not of the standard set in previous weeks. Steers were not comparable to the previous week while the heifers were 7c to 13c/kg cheaper. The light poor cows lost up to 31c while the majority were 11c to 16c/kg cheaper. Heavy bulls eased 4c/kg. 

Light steers mostly sold around 140c/kg. The medium weights were in fair numbers and they peaked at 135c and the better grades averaged 131.6c/kg. There were too few heavy steers and bullocks to provide an accurate quote. 

The heifers peaked at 130.2c and the better grades averaged 123c while the poor stock sold around 109c/kg. Light cows sold to 114.2c and the D2s averaged 100.3c/kg. The medium weight cows reached 128.2c and the D3s averaged 124c/kg.

The expected price drop did not occur and prices held firm with the larger numbers, with the exception of some grades, which sold to an easier market. Quality was similar to previous weeks with smaller bullock numbers offered. All regular buyers plus one extra export operator were present and operating.

Medium weight grown steers ranged from 126.2¢ to 145.2¢ with most sales at 134.2¢/kg. Both medium and heavy weights maintained firm rates with the heavier lines averaging 145.8¢ after topping at 156.2¢/kg.

The regular field of export buyers were present along with several local domestic processors.  

The prime grown steers and bullocks were fully firm to slightly dearer, however the plainer quality pens were slightly cheaper.  The well finished C3 heavy weight pens made from 148.2¢ to 153.2¢/kg.  Grown heifers were firm to slightly easier and the D muscled pens sold up to 130¢/kg.

A small number of young males to restockers sold to 280c/kg. A small number of aged cows and calves sold to $820/unit."
"Number reduced dramatically as quality too started to fall. All the regular buyers were operating on the yarding of predominately local cattle.  Values were varied with steers dearer, yet cows were mostly cheaper. 

Light steers in pen lots sold to 137.2c as plain lines averaged 105c/kg. A large number of good heavy steers sold to 159.2c to average 157c/kg. Light export heifers made to 129.2c, most closer to 117.6c/kg. 

Cows dominated the sale with most selling to a cheaper market. Light D2s averaged 112.2c as others made to 129.2c/kg. Plain E1s averaged 71.6c/kg. Medium weight D3s averaged 121.7c as the D4s topped at 137.2c/kg. 

A fair percentage of the bulls were plain lines, while a single C2 heavy weight reached 120.2c/kg."
"Number increased considerably as did quality with a much better overall yarding than last weeks sale. The entire field of regular buyers attended the sale plus some additional southern support. Prices were generally dearer with keen demand for all heavier weight cattle. 

A number of large lines of steers were a standout in the grown cattle sale with some very good steers from the Homestead region selling in excess of 170c/kg. All weights and grades lifted in price with the medium weight lines selling from 151.2c to 171.2c a gain of 5c/kg. Heavy steers sold from 165.2c to 174.2c and a very good offering of bullocks lifted 9c/kg averaging $1,109/head.  

Cow prices continued their upward trend with all weights improving, lightweights jumped between 4c and 7c to average 139.3c/kg for the 3 scores. The greatest percentage of medium weights gained 9c selling from 137.2c to 155.2c and the heavyweight lines averaged 155.2c/kg."
"Number increased by more than 350 head to 1,954 cattle for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, featuring several good quality lines of prime cow and one large line of northern bred steers. All major processors were in attendance, but not operating, while one feeder buyer had limited participation, supported by one live exporter and several restockers and onlookers. The larger offering of light and feeder weight steers sold slightly easier on last sale, while heavy 2 and 3 score cows lifted by 3c to 5c/kg and heavy bulls sold firm on last sale. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Julia Creek, Richmond, Torrens Creek, Mt Garnet, Greenvale, Ravenswood, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were predominantly heavier suitable weaned types easing on last sale, topping at 288c, with most better quality lines selling from 268c to 274c/kg. A very large line of northern bred yearling steers met strong restocker interest with 280-330kg steers selling to 245c, to average 237c, while medium weight feeder steers also to restockers sold to 242c, also averaging 237c/kg. Heavy steers to restockers sold to 230c/kg. The supply of vealer heifers was insufficient to quote, however heifer calves sold to 221c/kg. There were insufficient yearling heifers to quote.

Fewer numbers of heavy bullocks were penned this week, with the reduced supply also off lesser quality and weight than recent weeks. Heavy 3 score bullocks to slaughter sold to 247c, with medium weight 3 score bullocks selling to 246c, to average 244c/kg. A small number of grown steers to feed made 218c/kg. Another very good offering of prime cows were on offer, with values generally increasing for a large selection of better quality types. Extra heavy cows improved by 1c to average 201c, topping at 207c/kg. A large sample of heavy 3 score cows sold to 206c, to average 193c, and 2 scores to processors sold to 197c, to average 188c/kg. A selection of heavy D muscled cows were of generally less weight than previous weeks, selling to 165c to average 23c lower, at 146c, while medium weight cows sold to 160c, to average 148c/kg. Cows to restockers were insufficient to quote. A larger offering of heavy bulls to live export continued recent prices, selling firm to a top of 274c, with similar types to feed destined for live export selling to 270c, with most between 250c and 260c/kg. Medium weight bulls to feed sold to 261c, with feeder weights to 235c/kg. A large offering of young males returning to grass sold to 294c, to average 253c/kg. Good quality cows and calves sold from $880 to $1,200/unit."
"Number increased by 1,134 head to 2,752 cattle for Charters Towers Combined Selling agents this week, the bigger offering was comprised of some well finished lines of prime bullocks and cows, in conjunction with one large line of plainer northern store steers and heifers. All regular processors were in attendance and operating at increased prices, supported by two regular feeder buyers, one live exporter and several restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Julia Creek, Croydon, Ingham, Ravenswood, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

Numbers lifted considerably due to a large line of light northern vealer steers which sold to 370c, averaging up 13c on last sale to 369c, with a large number of light steers(less than 200kg) averaging 323c/kg. Yearling steers were more variable and also lifted in price, with feeder weights to live export reaching 315c, and averaging 256c, while steers to restockers sold to 326c to average 323c/kg. Heavy feeder steers to feed sold 285c/kg. Vealer heifers most notably consisted of one northern line of light weight types selling to 298c for those returning to grass, averaging 283c, with multiple lines of better finished types to live export selling to 272c/kg. Yearling heifers of feeder specifications to live export sold to 285c, averaging 284c, while heifers returning to grass sold to 283c for lighter types and up to 300c/kg for heavier, better grown types. Grown heifers returned to grass sold to 305c with most sales between 242 and 266c/kg.

One very good line of heavy 3 score bullocks to slaughter sold to 275c, averaging 268c, with multiple lines selling for 272c/kg. Lighter conditioned bullocks returning to grass sold to 261c, to average 250c/kg. A larger offering of grown steers sold to similar prices to slaughter, reaching 275c to average 268c/kg. Heavy feeder steers to live export sold to 292c to average 287c, with plainer types returning to paddock making 289c/kg. Well finished heavy C muscled cows to slaughter sold to 260c, lifting 6c to average 234c, while heavy cows above 520kg sold to 247c to average 246c/kg. Heavy D muscled cows sold to 237c, to average 226c, up 3c, with 2 score cows averaging 209c/kg. A small number of lighter cows to restockers sold to 181c/kg. A small number of heavy bulls to slaughter sold to 254c, while suitable types to live export sold to 258c/kg. Feeder bulls to live export made to 300c, with most sales between 260 and 290c/kg. Light males to restockers sold to 318c/kg. Several small lines of cows and calves sold to $1,500/unit."
"Not all the regular buyers were in attendance although there was added competition from wholesalers. The reduced yarding was mainly due to some stock not arriving at the market until after curfew and they were sold as store cattle at the completion of the sale. Trends followed those set across the state and the mainly poorer quality yarding generally lost ground. Cows were in dominant numbers although steers and heifers were well represented. 

The light steers were of poor quality, which was reflected, in low prices and the D2s averaged 113.7c/kg. Medium weights made up to the majority of the steer section and lost around 10c to 11c and the D3s averaged 135.5c/kg. The heavier steers faired a little better and were from 1c to 5c cheaper, which saw the better quality stock averaged 145.1c/kg. 

Grown heifers improved in value and the D3s averaged 120.4c/kg. The large number of cows offered were of plainer quality and the light weights lost up to 7c as the struggled to reach 100c and the D1s averaged 94c/kg. The medium weights saw a large number of D1s averaged 97.7c while the D2s averaged 103.4c/kg. 

A handful of bulls lost ground and the heavy weights averaged 104.9c/kg."
"Not all buyers were present and of those that were, not all operated, on a mostly poor quality smaller yarding. With the majority of the yarding comprising store drafts only one processor purchased the majority of suitable export cattle, while the remainder was purchased by trader and butcher buyers. 

Grown steers were in limited number with light weights averaging between 103.4c and 128.5c/kg. Heifers comprised mostly medium weight D2s and they improved slightly to average 135.9c after topping at 139.2c/kg.

Cow were of mostly under 400kg descriptions and sold at an average of 119.2c after topping at 126.2c/kg. Bulls were of poor quality and topped at 110c/kg."
"Most of the usual buyers were in attendance although the market sold to subdued competition. The smaller yarding was reported to be of poorer quality and it would appear producers held off yarding stock following the cheaper markets of the last month. Prices were much cheaper on the quotable grades and the cows, which made up over half the yarding lost up to 24c/kg. 

Close to half the steers were poor quality lightweights that sold to restockers at 105c/kg. An accurate trend is not possible on the remaining stock that sold to a top of 130.2c/kg. 

The grown heifers sold to 124.2c and the poorer quality stock averaged 86.9c/kg. The light cows reached 75c/kg. The medium weights topped at 95c and most were around 17c and 18c cheaper, which saw a large number of D2s averaged around 80c/kg."
"Limited supply led to another reduced yarding of mixed quality. All but one of the regular processors were present and all local buyers attended. Steers were in better condition than the previous sale but cows were of poorer quality. 

Grown steers sold to strong processor competition, medium weights averaged 161.4c after selling to 170.2c/kg. Heavy weight C3 types remained fully firm and sold mostly around 172c/kg. The better quality D2s improved slightly to sell to 125.2c, averaging 120.7c/kg. 

A plainer quality cow yarding sold to a dearer trend, possibly as a result of the lower numbers. Light weight D2s averaged 126.6c after topping at 132.2c/kg. Heavy cows were mostly D3 descriptions and they sold to 146.2c to average 141.1c/kg. Most bulls were light weights and they topped at 118.2c/kg."
"Large numbers continue with 2,020 cattle penned in a prime only sale today, with 4,200 cattle booked for a store sale on Friday. Quality was very mixed - ranging from some very good quality lines of heavy prime cows along to lines of northern pastoral cows and bulls. All the regular processors operated at stronger rates in line with recent grid adjustments, along with two live exporters, regular feeders and backgrounders. Grown steers increased 7c, heifers lifted 9c and cows to processors sold 9c to 17c/kg higher. Cattle were drawn from far northern and western areas, with many small lines from the local area. 

Yearling steers to feed sold to 426c to average from 397c to 410c/kg. Yearling heifers above 330kg to feed sold to a top of 402c to average 394c/kg. Grown steers above 400kg to feed reached 400c and averaged 371c, while heavy trade types reached 378c/kg to average the same. A good sample of suitable heavy steers to live export averaged 374c/kg. Grown heifers to the trade topped at 338c to average 327c and heifers to feed made to 368c to average 342c/kg.   

Small lines of heavy full-mouthed bullocks to export slaughter sold to 376c, averaging near 360c/kg. Very strong demand for cows continued with all processors very active throughout the offering. A small sample of medium weight score 2 cows sold to a top of 310c, while score 3 cows reached 324c to average 311c/kg. Prime heavy weight cows topped at 327c to average 318c/kg. Light cows to restockers averaged 283c and medium weight cows to restockers sold to 308c to average 302c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export sold to a top of 378c to average 321c and bulls to processors averaged 297c/kg. 

Market Reporter, Mick Kingham."
"It was a very small yarding of mostly plain cattle. All the regular buyers attended but not all made purchases as one major processor is yet to open it s operating plant in that region of the state. As a result competition was weaker and the market sold to local butchers and one or two processor buyers only. 

Steers averaged 117.3c/kg while the limited number of heifers were bought by local butchers. 

A plain quality cow yarding eased on last weeks levels, lightweight D2s managed 103.6c while medium weights averaged 110.1c/kg."
"It was a reduced yarding of 913 cattle for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents, 207 head fewer than last sale, with many lines showing the effects of the season. Some isolated storms over the past week contributed to the reduced yarding, with limited numbers of prime bullocks and cows selling to dearer prices. The regular buyer panel of processors, live exporters and one feeder buyer were in attendance and operating strongly throughout, although the limited numbers of store cattle penned saw minimal restocker activity. Cattle were drawn from Mount Isa, Normanton, Einasleigh, Greenvale, local and coastal areas.

There were insufficient numbers of vealer steers to quote, with one pen making 280c/kg. Yearling steers were also in limited supply, as steers above 330kg and going to live export sold for 276c, while those above 380kg made 282c/kg. A very small offering of vealer heifers returning to grass made to 180c and yearling heifers to feed sold to 236c to average 225c/kg.

Despite the limited numbers, some good pens of heavy export bullocks lifted 4c, reaching 294c and averaging 291c, while 4 score bullocks sold to 299c/kg. Younger and lighter medium weight bullocks sold to 298c, averaging 293c, up 12c/kg on last sale. A single heavy grown steer to processors sold for 310c, with similar steers making from 274c to 299c/kg. The quality and weight of heavy cows was generally below that of the previous few months, with several lines showing the effect of the season. However, competition was still strong throughout. Heavy 3 score cows improved by 5c, with 3 scores reaching 252c to average 236c, while 4 score cows sold to 242c/kg. Heavy 3 score D muscled cows sold to 228c, lifting 12c to average above 222c, while medium weight 2 score cows lifted 10c to average 185c/kg. Light 1 and 2 score cows to processors also improved by 6c to 10c/kg. Some very good lines of grown heifers to processors improved by 25c, reaching a top of 271c to average 260c/kg. Some large lines of northern bulls met strong demand, with most types lifting 5c to 20c/kg. Heavy 3 score bulls to feed destined for live export sold to 269c to average 260c and heavy 2 score bulls made to 270c to average 261c/kg. Heavy bulls to processors eased 14c making to 244c, while 2 score bulls sold to 231c, with most sales making from 216c 230c/kg. Feeder bulls weighing 280-360kg destined for live export, sold to 278c, with most sales making from 230c to 255c/kg. A small sample of young males weighing 280-330kg sold to live export for 272c/kg."
"It was a reduced yarding compared to the previous week, with 2,083 head drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents. A full gallery of regular processors and western restockers competed on a mixed quality yarding ahead of a promising weather forecast. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Croydon, Georgetown, Richmond, Ingham, Woodstock and local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were of mixed quality, however restockers were very active throughout. Light weight vealer steers topped at 366.2c, with many lines selling above 360.2c and averaging 352.3c/kg. Yearling steers to feed topped at 296.8c, while those to restockers sold to 315.2c/kg. Vealer heifers were in good supply and in strong demand, selling to 318.2c and averaging 298.6c/kg. Yearling heifers were of very good quality, with very strong competition from feeder and restocker buyers. Feeder weight heifers sold to 311.2c and averaged 294.4c, while yearling heifers to restockers sold to 312.2c, to average 278.6c/kg.

Grown steers sold to 328.2c/kg. An increased number of bullocks sold strongly, with heavy 3 score bullocks selling to 299.2c/kg for slaughter types. Restockers were active on 2 score and lighter weight bullocks which topped at 276.2c/kg. Heavy 3 score cows were fewer in number than previous weeks, with values decreasing by up to 10c/kg.

A large number of mixed quality bulls were offered, with heavy 3 score bulls to slaughter topping at 269.2c, while a live exporter paid to 278.2c/kg for medium and heavy 2 score bulls. Medium weight bulls to feed, destined for live export sold to 314.2c/kg, while younger males sold to 350.2c/kg.

A limited number of mixed quality cows and calves sold to $1,200/unit."
"It was a mainly poor quality yarding which saw most stock in store condition although the heifers were of better quality and sold to increased butcher competition. Values for these improved while the cows and light quality steers were cheaper. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance however competition was subdued on the small poor quality yarding. 

The light steers topped at 112.2c to average 109c while the best medium weights reached 119.2c/kg. The better quality heifers improved by 8c and averaged 115.4c after they topped at 127.2c/kg.

"Isolated storms across the supply area reduced numbers by 420 head to 2587 cattle this week in very humid conditions.  Several lines of good conditioned cows were presented with overall quality generally good for both prime and store cattle.  The regular buyer panel of processors, backgrounders and feeders was bolstered by two opportunity central restockers operating strongly throughout.  Cattle were drawn from Cloncurry, Richmond, Ingham, Belyando, local and coastal areas.  Most categories improved by 5-20c, with strong demand throughout the sale.

Increased numbers of steer calves returning to grass sold to 506.2c to average 475c, while heifer calves to processors reached 420.2c to average near 418c/kg.  A large sample of vealer steers above 200kg returning to grass reached 488c to average 469c/kg and steers above 280kg to feed topped at 446.2c  to average 420-426c/kg.

A reduced supply of yearling steers to feed sold to 446.2c to average 410-424c/kg.  Yearling heifers above 280kg to feed topped 368.2c averaging 335-361c/kg.

Grown steers above 400kfg to feed reached 357.2c, with trade types also reaching 357.2c.  Good quality lines of grown heifers to the trade sold to 336.2c to average 308c, with lesser quality lnes averaging 272c/kg.  Heavy full mouthed bullcoks to export slaughter sold to 357.2c/kg.

Small lines of cows and calves sold to $1720/unit."
"Isolated storms across the region and a store sale on Friday with 3,600 head booked, resulted in numbers easing by 1,656 head to 1,943 cattle this week.  Records tumbled for heavy cows and bulls in spirited competition, with heifers and steers to the trade up by 20c for most categories, cows eased 5c and bulls were up by 3 to 5c/kg. Quality was generally good, led by one large single vendor line of grain-fed heifers and some very good pens of heavy prime cows. All regular processors were in attendance, supported by two live exporters, central and southern feeder buyers and restockers from the south and west. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Normanton, Pentland, Greenvale, Belyando as well as local and coastal areas.

Grown heifers to the trade topped at 366.2c to average 350c while heifers to feed averaged from 328c to 347c/kg. Due to there being limited numbers of heavy bullocks, this category was not quoted. 

Cow prices hit all time highs, heavy cows (speyed and PTE) to live export sold to 370.2c, with a large sample averaging 345c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows to processors sold to 292.2c to average above 278c, while 3 score cows made to a top of 306.2c to average from 278c to 293c/kg.

"Isolated showers and storms across much of the local area saw a reduced yarding of 1,380 cattle in a prime only sale. A store sale scheduled for Friday has 3,000 head currently booked. Quality was well below recent weeks, with several lines of northern pastoral cows and bulls, along with many local lines showing the effects of the lengthening dry season. All processors were active for the quality on offer along with regular feeders, backgrounders and opportunity restockers. Grown steers increased 6c, heifers to the trade were 4c easier, bullocks were firm, cows to processors averaged 7c to 13c/kg higher and heavy bulls were firm.

A good supply of heavy full-mouthed bullocks to export slaughter reached 388c multiple times to average from 374c to 380c and 2 scores averaged 362c/kg. A rain affected reduction in the supply of cows resulted in very strong demand for the reduced quality on offer.

"Isolated showers across the region and a return to a combined prime and store sale, saw 2,882 cattle penned this week. Quality was mixed throughout, however some very good lines of prime cows, steers and heifers were on offer. One major export processor was again absent from the gallery, however one southern processor attended for the first time this year, supported by regular feeder and background operators, restockers and two live exporters who were all active throughout the sale. Strong demand from processors saw cows selling firm, steers to feed eased, while yearling heifers sold to stronger rates for the improved quality. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Richmond, Mt Surprise, Mareeba, Tully, Townsville, Ayr, Collinsville, local and coastal areas. 

Steer calves returning to grass sold to a top of 492c with mixed sexes averaging 460c and heifers to the trade reaching 396c to average above 386c/kg.

"Isolated rain events across much of the north and a scheduled store sale on Friday, numbers fell to 582 cattle in a Prime only sale. The regular buyer panel operated at similar rates to last sale despite a smaller offering, with some very good quality lines of heavy grown steers, bullocks and cows penned.

"Included in the larger yarding were large lines of even cattle, which improved the overall quality. As the supply area stays dry and the prices stay high it is expected that producers will keep offloading cattle through the yards. All the regular buyers were active with values improving for all descriptions with the cows gaining the most. 

Most of the steers offered were medium weights selling to a top of 193.2c/kg. The heavy steers were in relatively small numbers for the size of the yarding, and reached 195.2c/kg to return over $1,100/head. All of the heavy bullocks returned over $1,100/head with over 140 averaging 193.3c/kg.

The light heifers received further gains with the D3s gaining 14c after selling to 178.2c/kg. The light cows were in large numbers but this had no negative effect on values, as the D2s averaged 145.5c/kg. The top of the cows was the medium weights selling to 179.2c/kg.  

All classes of bulls were offered in larger numbers with values improving further. The heavy bulls sold to 176.2c/kg to return over $1,200/head."

"In a prime only sale there was a yarding of 1727 cattle.  Quality was similar to last week with some good quality bullocks and prime cows on offer, supported by improved quality heavy bulls.  One regular processor was absent which impacted values throughout the sale, however one southern processor was active along with regular feeder buyers.  Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa  to Croydon, south to Greenvale, with many from the local area.

"In a pre Easter sale the Charters Towers agents yarded a slightly increased offering of cattle on Thursday. The market was cheaper overall, however some export heifers and bulls managed to display a dearer market. Once again females dominated the offering with increased numbers of steers, especially on the medium weight ranges. 

The grown steers and bullocks saw a sample of D2 medium weight steers sell to 123.8c/kg with their average at 119.7c/kg. In the heavier categories the same grade topped at 123.6c to average at 121.6c/kg, with double the numbers of the previous week. A sample of 62 D2 grown heifers saw both ends of the prices range fall to average at 105.1c/kg, however the leaner drafts managed to pick up their averages. 

Cows displayed a cheaper trend for the majority of categories to see the medium weight D2 average at 100.2c and top at 103.2c/kg. A smaller offering of bulls saw the light weights gain on average to top at 94.2c and average 90c/kg"
"Half the number of cattle were penned and it was mostly a poor quality yarding.  Not all the regular buyers were in attendance and all but a handful of heifers sold to a cheaper market. 

Grown steers were 3c to 7c cheaper, the medium weights reached 135.2c and a fair sample averaged 128.9c/kg, Heavy steers topped at 145.2c and averaged 142.1c/kg.

The grown heifers received mixed trends with some better quality D3s averaging dearer at 29.3c/kg. Most of the light cows were of poor quality and a large number sold under 100c/kg. The medium weight cows reached 115.2c and the D3s averaged 113.7c while the D1s averaged 95.3c/kg."
"Going against the trend of larger yardings, the agents offered a smaller number of cattle. Similar to other southern centre values suffered falls with not all buyers in operation. The quality was on par with recent weeks, but the plainer cattle are increasing, which is indicative of the current season. Cattle were drawn from the normal supply areas and west to Richmond.

Most of the steers and bullocks offered were medium weights. The light steers sold to 162.2c, as medium weights reached 191.2c/kg. A small number of better heavy weights managed to top at 200.2c with the heavy bullocks making to 198.2c/kg and averaging $1,200/head. 

The heifers in any number were dealt losses as the limited supply of C muscled types sold well to top at 167.2c/kg. The cows were dominated by light weights but the medium weights suffered the greatest losses. The best of the cows was the small number of heavy weights reaching 178.2c/kg. 

The large numbers of light bulls suffered only a small loss as the heavy weights made to 186.2c/kg."
"Following useful rain across a good section of the north, numbers lifted by 1700 to 2394 cattle in a Combined Prime and Store Sale. Quality was mixed throughout, featuring 1,100 cows in the prime section with some good heavy lines presented along with fewer good quality lines of store steers and heifers.  One major export processor was in attendance but not operating in a generally weaker market. Cattle were drawn from many northern areas including Mt Isa, Burketown, Mt Garnet, Hughenden, Torrens Creek, local and coastal areas.

Young light cattle met reduced competition easing by more than 100c on many lines, yearling steers and heifers averaged 40-60c lower, while grown heifers and cows averaged 13c to 30c/kg less. Heavy bulls improved by 13c in line with quality.

Vealer steers above returning to the paddock sold to 488.2c to average 439c to 465c/kg. Light vealer heifers returning to grass sold to 400.2c to average 385c/kg.

"Following the week off for Anzac day, numbers decreased by more than 800 head on the sale a fortnight ago for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents which featured some very good lines of prime cows and grown heifers along with some good lines of northern steers and heifers. Two major processors continued their absence with values easing in line with recent downward grid adjustments. With the absence of any feeder buyers, restockers were selective on quality with yearling steers easing by up to 14c/kg for better quality feeder weights, while the lack of competition saw heifers suffer the largest declines across all weight ranges. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Hughenden, Greenvale, Pentland, Woodstock, Ravenswood, Mt. Coolon, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were generally very good quality, but sold easier due to the lack of competition, topping at 260c, to average 247c/kg. Yearling steers largely sold 13c to 20c easier with 280-330kg steers returning to grass selling to 260c, to average 249c, while 330-400 kg steers averaged 238c/kg. Heavy feeder steers above 400kg sold to 222c/kg. Vealer heifers met limited demand across all classes, with values easing accordingly by more than 30c/kg. Vealer heifers returning to grass sold to 222c to average 180c while similar weight yearling heifers average 194c/kg. Yearling heifers above 280kg sold to 200c and were largely dominated by a large northern line.

Bullocks consisted of some good quality small lines selling firm on last sale to 244c for those to slaughter, while similar weights to live export sold to 252c, averaging 246c/kg. A similar number of grown steers above 400kg also sold firm, with a higher percentage going to feed destined for live export. These steers sold to 241c, with most sales from 200c to 227c/kg. A very good yarding of cows sold lower on last fortnight in line with recent grid adjustments and prices in southern selling centres. Extra heavy 3 score cows to processors sold to 179c and heavy cows sold to 181c to average 164c/kg. Heavy 2 score cows sold to 167c to average 154c, while light conditioned cows to restockers above 400kg sold to 162c/kg. Medium weight 3 score cows below 400kg to slaughter sold to 140c, to average 132c and light cows to restockers sold to 136c to average 111c/kg. A lift in numbers of very good grown heifers saw values ease by more than 20c, with 3 score heavy heifers to slaughter topping at 212c to average 193c, and 2 score heifers averaged 174c/kg. Heavy bulls continued recent strength topping at 271c to live export, most above 260c, with very few going to slaughter. Medium weight bulls to feed destined for live export sold to 275c, while young males returning to the paddock sold to 240c/kg."
"Following the trend of other centres, numbers were less than last week as the falling market sees producers not offloading cattle. All the regular buyers were operating, but the quality of the yarding was not up to previous weeks standards. As has happened at the rest of the markets, values have suffered further falls with the steers the most affected. 

Most of the steers and bullocks offered were lighter weights but it was the heavier categories that received the greatest losses. Medium weight steers sold to 185c, with heavy weights reaching 181.2c/kg. The limited heavy bullocks all returned over $1,000/head after selling to a top of 180.2c/kg. 

The heifers held on surprisingly well to remain firm to slightly cheaper with the D3s making to 162.2c/kg. The large number of light cows reached 152.2c and went against the falling trend to gain 2c and average 131.6c/kg. The medium D3s held firm after selling to 175c/kg

The bulls were dominated by light weights as the heavy weights made to 171.2c/kg and returned over $1,100/head."
"Following the trend of other centres, most descriptions sold to a dearer market as the regular panel of buyers plus an extra buyer competed strongly to secure numbers. The overall quality was reported as improved on previous weeks and this may have also played a part in the increased competition. The plainer types also sold to solid demand. 

The steers dominated the yarding with medium weights selling to 176.2c/kg. Almost two hundred and fifty heavy steers gained close to 20c after selling to 179.6c/kg. All of the heavy bullocks returned over $1,000/head with the better types selling to 178.2c/kg.

Heifers have been in demand at all centres and this continued to be the case here as the light D3s sold to 159.2c/kg. The light cows sold to 127.2c, as medium weight D3s averaged 138.5c after selling to 146.2c/kg. There was only two heavy cows offered and these sold for 157.2c/kg. 

The bulls also sold to a dearer trend. The medium weights sold to 140.2c, as the heavy weights averaged 136.9c/kg."
"Following the larger yardings of recent weeks, supply was reduced considerably as an annual bull sale will be held later in the day. The change in numbers made accurate quotes difficult although the overall trend was cheaper despite some grades gaining ground slightly. All the regular buyers were in attendance and there was some good steers penned however a large number of poor cows were sold.  Steers were 5c cheaper while the heifers varied either side of last weeks rates by 3c to 6c/kg. The cows lost 12c to 18c/kg although a small number of heavy weights did improve slightly.

The medium good quality weight steers sold to 147.2c and averaged 141.5c while the poorer grades saw most sales around 112c/kg. A fair percentage of the yarding was heifers that averaged around 101c although isolated sales reached 140.2c/kg.

The bulls were mostly light weights and they sold to 119.2c although most averaged 88.4c/kg. Heavy bulls topped at 131.2c/kg."
"Following the large supply in recent weeks with seperate prime and store sales, the supply eased for a yarding of 2679 cattle in a return to a combined prime and store sale. Two southern processors were notably absent in a very small buyer panel, assisted by one regular feeder and opportunity backgrounders. Quality was mixed, comprising of small lines of heavy bullocks, several good quality large lines of prime cows, supported by small lines of store steers and heifers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Georgetown, Richmond to Ingham and south to Belyando.

Values for all classes were lower than last sale.  Competition for well finished heavy lines was good, however lesser quality cattle in light condition were difficult to sell. Steers and heifers below 250kg met limited demand, with some failing to sell. Grown steers fell 30c to 40c, grown heifers eased 8c to 12c, bullocks softened by 2c to 23c, prime cows averaged 2c to 14c lower and bulls were down by 20c to 25c/kg.

"Following the exceptional unseasonal rain after last sale, numbers fell by 170 head for a yarding of 1,526 cattle this week for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents. Some good lines of cows and bullocks, heavy bulls and one large line of northern cattle were the feature of the sale.

All major processors were in attendance but not operating, accompanied by a select few restockers lifting demand throughout the sale. A good offering of heavy cows and grown steers saw prices lift for better quality heavy lines, while very light store cows eased by up to 20c/kg. A small number of store cattle were presented, with quality determining the increase in price. Cattle were drawn from Hughenden, Croydon, Woodstock, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

There were insufficient vealer steers and heifers to quote, however small lines of steers sold to 330c, while heifers made to 248c/kg.

Quality was mixed, comprising of some good quality heavy bullocks and 985 cows, supported by many mixed quality lines of store steers and heifers.  All regular processors were in attendance and operating in line with other selling centres. One regular feeder was notably absent, however the buyer gallery was filled with many interested onlookers, opportunity restockers and backgrounders. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Richmond, north to Georgetown and south to the local area.

"Following recent rain across many parts of the north and west in recent weeks and the Easter Long weekend, numbers declined dramatically for a very small yarding of 214 head for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week. With less than 100 prime cattle, values for cows or bullocks sold to similar prices of the previous sale a fortnight ago. All major processors were in attendance and operating for the very small offering, along with one live exporter and a few interested restockers and on lookers to round out the gallery.

"Following last weeks much cheaper market numbers reduced dramatically. Producers may also have had an opportunity to way up their marketing options with 4,000 head currently loading on a boat in Townsville destined for Egypt. In spite of the small numbers there was a greater number of better quality cattle than previous weeks. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance and due to the small yarding an accurate quote on trends is not possible although there was stronger competition on the better quality grades. 

The medium weight steers sold to a top of 138.2c and a large number averaged 130.1c/kg. The heavy steers sold to a top of 140.2c and averaged between 133c and 137.8c/kg. The best heavy bullocks sold to 147.2c/kg and returned close to $1,000/head.

"Following a 2 week break due to insufficient numbers, a yarding of 642 head was drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents. Several small lines of well finished prime cows were on offer, supported by one large line of yearling heifers donated for the Western Flood Appeal. Two regular processors were present and operating, along with one live exporter, two feeder buyers, regular local backgrounders and restockers. Cattle were drawn from Greenvale, Mt Coolon and local areas. A small offering of vealer steers sold easier on last sale, while yearling steers generally comprised of small lines of irregular quality, easing by up to 13c/kg for those returning to the paddock. Yearling steers to feed improved by 10c/kg, with most destined for live export. Light yearling heifers to feed eased by 8c, however medium and heavy yearling heifers to feed improved by up to 27c/kg. An improved offering of heavy grown heifers to processing showed the largest gain, increasing more than 60c, while heavy 3 and 4 score cows improved from 15c to 20c/kg. Live export activity saw heavy bulls improve by up to 30c/kg.

Vealer steers to restockers sold to 266c, while yearling steers returning to the paddock made to 253c/kg. Good conditioned vealer heifers returning to the paddock made to 236c, while similar types to feed sold to 230c, averaging 223c/kg.

"Even though numbers increased supply was still small. There were some good cows available and a fair number of medium weight steers. Quality was generally mixed apart from the very best steers. All the regular buyers were in attendance although a large percentage of the yarding sold to local butchers. 

Light steers generally sold around 100c/kg. The best medium weight sold to 131.2c although most were of poorer quality and averaged 115.9c/kg. The heavy steers were of better presentation and topped at 139.2c while heavy bullocks sold at 135.2c/kg. 

A small number of heifers sold to 129.2c/kg. The light cows sold on a dearer trend and averaged around 90c/kg. The medium weight cows were 3c to 9c dearer and the D3s averaged 108.7c while the best D4s topped at 122.2c/kg."
"Even though a similar sized yarding was offered, it was down on what was drawn for. Competition was from the regular field of buyers with values following trends from other markets to be varied. There was only a handful of better quality pens with the remainder of the yarding plainer lines. 

Most of the light steers were plain lean lines averaging 89.6c as medium weights topped at 133.2c with a large number of D3s averaging 127.3c/kg. Good heavy steers made to 144.2c with heavy bullocks making to 146.2c/klg. Light export heifers did not miss out on the cheaper trend with most averaging close to 111c/kg. 

Better light cows sold to 102.2c as most averaged closer to 70.2c/kg. Lean medium weights in the in the greatest number averaged 101.4c/kg. The top of the cows was medium weights making to 115.2c/kg. A fair number of bulls were offered, however most were plainer lines."
Done
"Diminishing feed conditions and cooler temperatures resulted in a reduced yarding of plainer quality cattle. The number of well-finished descriptions is decreasing as the weeks roll on into winter. The absence of one export processor did not have much affect on competition as the remaining gallery secured the suitable lines of export grades. 

Medium weight grown steers were of fairly even quality with C3s topping at 158.2c/kg. The plainer lines averaged 135.9c for D2s and 144.4c/kg for the D3s. Similar fat and muscle score heifers topped at 135c to average 121.4c/kg. 

Large runs of D3 medium weight cows eased slightly to range from 119.2c to 136.2c to average 126.8c/kg. Lightweight cows were also offered in reasonable numbers and despite their lack of quality they held firm on last week levels to average 110.2c/kg. The best of the bulls made 120.2c/kg for a lightweight description."
"Despite widespread scattered storms across the north, a combined prime and store sale attracted 2,595 cattle, an increase of 24 head on last sale. Quality was very mixed with a large offering of northern pastoral cows and bulls, and many lines showing effects of the lengthening dry season. However, some very good quality lines of grown steers and well finished cows were on offer. The regular buyer panel was in attendance and operated at stronger rates to last sale including new saleyard records. Grown steers lifted by 12c to 40c, bullocks sold firm, heavy cows to processors lifted 6c to 10c and bulls averaged 7c/kg higher. Cattle were drawn from Tennant Ck, Normanton, Hughenden, Pentland, Hervey’s Range, Ingham, local and coastal areas.

"Despite recent isolated storms across most eastern areas, numbers increased by 214 head to 1,120 cattle for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week. Prices for most categories improved owing to supply shortages in southern areas and subsequent need to fill orders. All processors were in attendance and operating at increased rates for better yielding prime cattle, while lighter types also lifted in price.

Featured were greater numbers of prime cows and bullocks and one large line of northern steers and heifers. All buyers were present and operating, along with additional support from feeders and exporters.

"Despite a two week break due to insufficient numbers and inclement weather conditions, a smaller yarding of 1,058 cattle were drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week. The yarding was of very mixed quality, with some small lines of well finished cows and very good quality yearling steers of most interest to a subdued buying gallery, with one notable processor absence, while regular feeder buyers and opportunity western restockers were present and operating. The yarding was drawn from Chillagoe, Hughenden, Greenvale, Ingham, Ravenswood, local and coastal areas. Vealer steers were of very mixed quality and sold higher to 376c for the better quality types, averaging 361c/kg.

Young males sold to 354c/kg. Some good quality young cows and calves sold to $1,440/unit."
"Cooler temperatures and tightening feed supplies continue to affect quality with larger numbers of plainer cattle offered. The absence of one export buyer also contributed to a weaker overall market. Numbers were significantly reduced, as the number of cattle in the region appears to be declining. Market competition was mixed with demand strongest on the limited number of well-finished descriptions.  

Heavy weight grown steers were of plain quality with many store types offered.  C3 s topped at 165.2c after averaging 162.6c while the lighter lines topped at 160c/kg. Bullocks held firm to range from 160.2c to 167.2c to average 163.1c/kg. Lighter D3 heifers averaged 141.7c after reaching a top of 150.2c/kg. 

Large runs of D3 medium weight cows sold at mixed rates to range from 129.2c to 140.2c to average 136.7c/kg. Lightweight cows were also offered in reasonable numbers and despite their lack of quality they encountered strong demand from restockers but eased slightly on last week s levels to average 93.5c/kg. The best of the bulls made 146.2c/kg for a well-finished description."
"Cooler temperatures and overcast skies could not prevent all the usual buyers turning out for a similar sized yarding. Overall quality was the best seen for some weeks with large runs of well-finished grown steers and cows offered. Market competition was strong and all grades achieved dearer levels. 

Heavy weight grown steers were of fairly even quality in a yarding of mostly older steers and bullocks. Quality C2 steers topped at 159.2c after averaging 157.6c while the better-finished lines topped at 168.2c/kg. Bullocks improved to range from 164c to 168.2c to average 165.7c/kg.

Lightweight cows were also offered in reasonable numbers and despite their lack of quality, they gained slightly on last weeks levels to average 119.9c/kg. The best of the bulls made 138.2c/kg for a well-finished description."
"Continuing hot and dry conditions across much of the north resulted in 1,723 cattle penned in a prime only sale, with 5,000 head booked for a store sale on Friday.  Quality was generally good with increased numbers of prime bullocks penned, along with good lines of heavy cows and fewer numbers of heifers and bulls. One regular central processor was absent, however all others operated selectively with feeders, backgrounders and opportunity restockers.  Grown steers eased by 6c to 15c, heifers averaged 20c lower, bullocks and prime cows averaged 14c/kg, lower and bulls sold firm. Cattle were drawn from Hughenden, Greenvale, Ayr, local and coastal areas.

A good sample of yearling steers above 330kg to feed topped at 526.2c to average 524c/kg, with backgrounders steers averaging a simlar amount.  A limited supply of yearling heifers to feed above 200kg sold to and averaged 496.2c, and heifers above 280kg to feed averaged 496c/kg.

Increased numbers of grown steers above 400kg to feed sold to 520.2c to average 462c to 498c, with backgrounders averaging 450c to 470c/kg. Fewer grown heifers to feed topped at 472.2c averaging 409c to 433c, while heifers returning to grass averaged 461c/kg. An increased supply of heavy full-mouth bullocks to export slaughter topped at 446.2c multiple times to average 441c/kg. A large sample of cows less than 400kg returning to grass sold to 380.2c multiple times to average 367c/kg.  Medium weight 3 score cows to processors reached 386.2c to average 376c to 378c/kg.

"Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents yarded only 512 cattle this week, 1,125 fewer than last sale owing to the Australia Day Public holiday and the local Ashes Cricket weekend. Some good lines of prime cows and grown steers were on offer, supported by several small lines of store bulls, steers and heifers.

"Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents yarded 2,464 cattle, 242 fewer than last sale. Increased numbers of prime heavy bullocks and cows generally saw prices ease, while store steers and heifers generally eased on previous week's prices. One regular processor and a more recent processor were absent, with others operating at revised prices. One local feeder buyer operated alone along with opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from Burketown, Normanton, Richmond, Hughenden, Ingham, Woodstock, Ravenswood, local and coastal areas.

Fewer numbers of vealer steers met limited demand, however better quality lines sold firm on last sale, topping at 285c for heavier types, to average 263c, while light vealer steers sold to 214c/kg.

The absence of a feeder buyer saw most yearling heifers return to grass, with those above 280kg selling to 184c to average 167c/kg. Yearling heifers to slaughter sold for 177c/kg.

Increased numbers of heavy bullocks were on offer, with most presenting in prime condition.

"Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents yarded 2,341 cattle this week, an increase of 44 head on last sale featuring continued lines of well finished good quality cows and bullocks, accompanied by some lines of western cattle showing the signs of the continuing dry season. With recent isolated storms across the northern region and the forecast of further isolated storms, there was cautious optimism among the buying gallery consisting of all regular processors for the first time this year, underpinning a firm to small increase in values for the heavier prime cattle, but more importantly creating competition throughout the offering. One regular feeder buyer and a small number of restockers were active on better quality lines, with lighter steers and heifers increasing by up to 20c for better types, while heavier types were generally 6c to 9c/kg lower. Cattle were drawn from Julia Creek, McKinlay, Richmond, Georgetown, Prairie, local and coastal areas.

Cattle were drawn from Burketown, Coen, Einasleigh, Richmond, Torrens Creek, Tully, Townsville, Homestead, Mount Coolon, local and coastal areas.

Fewer numbers of vealer steers presented in small lines as prices eased with limited buyer interest. Heavy vealer steers returning to grass sold to 250c/kg for better quality types.

A couple of light steers sold to 116.2c, D2 steers in the medium weight range sold to 125.2c to average 122c/kg.

Cows in the heavier weights, D2, made to 111.6c and these averaged 106.2c/kg.  A handful of bulls sold to 115c to average 111.2c/kg.  Overall, the market this week was a little easier in places."
"Charters Towers agents and vendors penned 1,705 head, 352 head fewer than last sale. Cattle were drawn from a wide area of the north and northwest including Winton, Cloncurry the Atherton Tableland and most local and close coastal areas including Mount Coolon. The yard was very mixed as usual. The usual buying panel competed with a little more vigour on the best quality lines, however there were quality related drops in some classes. 

The few calves penned improved in value with the best steer calves selling to 252c/kg. Yearling steers sold to 246c to return averages from 225c to 240c/kg. Yearling heifers made to 228c on occasions with averages in the mid 180c/kg range for the better bred pens.

"Cattle numbers increased by over 200 head at Charters Towers in a market that was firm to dearer for all but two grades. Export steers dominated the yarding with bulls in the minority. 

Following on from the sales in the south of the state the steers have continued to sell well. Medium C3s sold to a top of 151.4c to average 150c/kg, while heavy C3 steers sold to a top of 164.2c or an estimated 299c/kg cwt. 

The light heifers saw some of the biggest gains, as the D2s increased over 10c to average 121.4c while the D3s rose 2c to average 134.3c/kg. In only very small numbers light D2s reached 120.2c, while medium weight D3s lost 4c to average 129.5c/kg and the D4s lost over 10c to average 132.9c/kg.

The largest number of bulls was the medium weight D3s reaching 129.2c, while the top price was for a heavy D2 of 137.2c/kg."
"At Charters Towers on Thursday, values varied by a few cents either way of last weeks rates.  Medium steers D2 sold to 127.2c, to be up to 5c/kg dearer than last week.  A fair sample of D3s in the bullocks topped at 127.4c/kg.  

Best of the heifers sold up to 118.8c/kg for a fair sample of D2s.  In the cows, heavy D2s sold up to 115c to average 107.8c and were 2c/kg dearer than last Thursday.  

A few bulls sold to 116.2c/kg."
"As with southern markets, a larger yarding was offered as the current prices attract producers to offload cattle. Strong competition was evident from all the regular buyers on the mainly local cattle offering. Quality was on par with previous weeks.

Light steers were mainly plainer lines, however values improved as most averaged close to 128c/kg. A large number of lean medium weights averaged 153.8c as those suited to the Korean market sold to 166.2c/kg. Good heavy steers improved 5c to average 164.3c/kg. The top of the heavy bullocks reached 175.2c/kg.  Lean export heifers sold to 115c as better conditioned lines averaged 132.2c/kg. 

 Cows met solid demand with all grades realising dearer rates. Light D3s sold to 137.2c and averaged 134.6c as plainer types averaged 76.2c/kg. Good medium weights made to 156.2c as C3s held firm. Medium weight D3s averaged 137.1c/kg. The top of the heavy cows reached 153.2c/kg. Most light bulls sold close to 104c as heavy weights made to 134.2c/kg."
"As there was no sale last week this sale compares to a fortnight ago. Numbers decreased and all of the regular buyers were in attendance. Values were much dearer and quality was reported to be good for most descriptions. 

Grown steers were of much better quality and the light grades sold to 143.2c and the better D3s averaged 163.2c/kg. Medium weights were in the majority and topped at 173.2 to average 3c dearer at 167.2c/kg. A fair number of heavy steers reached 178.2c to average 175.2c/kg.

Heifers sold on mixed trends and those of lighter condition sold cheaper to average 130.6c, while the better D3s averaged close to 159c/kg. Cows were generally of good quality although there was a greater number of D2s available. Nevertheless values were dearer and light cows improved 8c to average 123.5c/kg Medium weight D3s increased by over 20c and reached 154.2 to average 145.9c/kg. 

Bulls followed the dearer trend and light weights averaged 120.8c/kg. the heavy weights topped at 165.2c to average 155.7c/kg."
"As the selling season draws to a close, numbers fell by 1,227 head for a yarding of 1,017 cattle for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, featuring a much smaller yarding of prime cattle and some mixed quality store cattle. Only two of the five regular processors were in attendance and operating at slightly lower rates than last sale, while store cattle met very strong demand from several restockers, with plenty of onlookers analysing the market. Cattle were drawn from Chillagoe, Richmond, Hughenden, Ingham, Woodstock, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers met solid demand selling firm on last sale, with restockers very active on the mixed quality types, selling to 356c to average 339c/kg. Yearling steers were of very mixed quality and weight with better quality steers less than 280kg selling to 330c to restockers, while 280-330kg steers sold to 304c, averaging 297c/kg. A small number of heavy feeder yearling steers sold to 266c. Vealer heifers lifted 7c to 9c on last sale, topping at 304c to average 282c for 200-280kg heifers, with some well grown 280-330kg heifers selling to 286c/kg. Yearling heifers were in shorter supply and the mixed quality met limited demand for lesser quality lines. Light yearling heifers returning to grass sold to 262c, while heavier joiner heifers sold to 269c/kg.

Fewer numbers of bullocks met good competition despite the lack of processor attendance, with bullocks to slaughter topping at 262c easing 5c to average 252c/kg. A central grass fattener was active for lighter types, lifting values by 15c, topping at 252 to average 240c/kg.

Cow numbers were lower again this week with heavy 3 score cows topping at 241c, averaging 216c, while 2 score cows sold to 217c to average 201c/kg. Heavy D muscled 2 score cows sold to 212c to average 197c, while lighter 2 score cows to restockers made to 191c, averaging 175c/kg. A small number of grown heifers to slaughter sold to 241c/kg. A mixed quality offering of bulls met stronger demand for better quality types, with heavy bulls to slaughter topping at 241c, while feeder weight bulls to feed, destined for live export sold to 300c/kg. Light young males met spirited bidding from the gallery, topping at 388c, with most sales 310c to 322c/kg. A small number of fair quality cows and calves sold to $860/unit."
"As the end of the year draws closer, numbers fell away considerably. The overall quality of the yarding was rather plain. Most of the cattle offered were light weights and with only the one processors active values for some categories suffered falls.  

The light steers managed to sell to 140.2c while the single heavy bullock returned over $1,000 after reaching 178.2c/kg. The limited competition saw the heifers slip 10c/kg. 

Dominating the sale was the light cows and bulls. The light D2 cows averaged 128.8c with the heavier categories selling to 153.2c/kg. The top of the bulls was the light weights making to 140.2c, while the medium weights averaged 134.4c/kg. 

Depending on cattle availability this may well be the last sale for the year with the next one scheduled for the second week in January."
"As prices continue to fall, numbers reduced considerably. Quality was mainly plain as the poor season continues. Females dominated the sale with limited numbers of young cattle penned. 

Medium weight steers made to 125.2c to average 115.7c as the limited number of heavy weights reached 133.2c/kg. The better light heifers sold to 116.2c as plainer E2s averaged 94.2c/kg. 

Light cows made to 91.2c as plainer lines averaged 65.4c/kg. Medium weight D2s reached 100c as a small pen of D3s sold for 105c/kg."
"As numbers returned to pre-Easter levels, cows dominated the export yarding. The quality of the offering was reported as not to the standard of previous weeks. The lack of quality can be attributed to the drying season, causing feed quality to slip. All the usual local and export buyers were in attendance.

The light D2 steers sold to 141.2c, as the medium weights topped at 163.2c/kg. Processors were keen to obtain the better end of the heavy steers and bullocks, as large numbers of heavy steers also sold to 163.2c/kg. Heavy bullocks were in small numbers, but still sold to 166.2c to return over $1,000/head. 

The light weight heifers were dealt losses of up to 9c, as the D3s reached 146.2c to average 136c/kg. The large numbers of cows received similar losses to the heifers. The light D2s topped at 125.2c, as the medium weight D3s reached 139.2c to average 129.6c/kg.

All bulls fell into the D1 category, with both the light and medium weights selling to 127.2c/kg. Heavy bulls were in the largest number and sold to 135.2c/kg."
"As is expected for this time of year, the yarding is becoming smaller and plainer in quality, there was however, some good cows scattered throughout. The reduced quality yarding was one of the major factors in the some types suffering losses. All the regular buyers were in attendance, but not all were active. 

The lighter steers gained 4c after selling to 128.2c, while the medium weights reached 160.2c/kg. The heavy steers and bullocks were in limited numbers, with the single heavy bullock returning over $1,000/head. 

The heifer quality was not up to previous weeks standards. Those in the largest number and suffering one of the largest falls for the sale was the D3s, despite selling to 136.2c/kg. The light cows sold to 122.2c, as large numbers of medium weight D3s averaged 126c/kg. 

Both the medium and heavy bulls suffered falls of 11c, with the heavy weights selling to 136.2c/kg."
"As has been the case across most markets, a dearer trend resulted from the reduced cattle offered direct and at physical markets. Export categories have again received the greatest gains with good quality cattle assisting the improvements. 

Good medium weight steers averaged 156.7c after selling to 160.2c/kg. The heavy steers topped at 169.2c to average 167c/kg. Grown heifers were in too few numbers to accurately quote. 

Light lean cows lifted 10c to average 102.4c/kg. A large number of medium weight D3s averaged 134.6c after selling to a top of 142.2c/kg. Heavy cows reached 139.4c/kg."
"Another reduced offering of 245 head at Charters Towers today in their post Easter sale. All grades managed to correct the losses that were encountered in last weeks market.

A limited number of grown steers and bullocks were penned with the top rates at 129.2c and the average at 128.1c/kg. There was very few grown heifers yarded and they made to 125.2c and averaged at 116.5c/kg.

A larger offering of lighter weight cows saw a sample of 106 D1s range from 85.2c to 105.2c/kg, with their average at 98.1c/kg. The smaller representation of medium weights ranged from 110c to 115c, to average at 112.7c/kg. Very few bulls were penned to form an accurate comparison however most quotes were in the early 100 mark."
"Another larger yarding was offered to all the regular buyers. Competition was not as strong as previous sales with most categories selling to a cheaper market. Cattle were mostly drawn from the local areas, which are showing the signs of lack of recent rain. 

Light steers were in limited numbers as most medium weights averaged 140.7c/kg. Good heavy steers averaged 152c after selling to 155.2c/kg.  Export heifers were dominated by leaner descriptions averaging 122.2c/kg. 

A fair number of cows were yarded with the majority in the light and medium weight ranges. Light cows sold to 127.2c with most selling in the 93c to 116c/kg range. Plain lightweights averaged under 79c/kg. Medium weight D3s averaged 129.4c after selling to 138.2c/kg. A small pen of heavy weights sold for 143.2c/kg."
"Another large yarding of 1,254 prime cattle were reported from Charters Towers this week where all descriptions met a strong market throughout.  In the export steers, medium types sold to 124.2c for a good sample of D3 s, heavy steers, C4, reached 133.6c, while other heavier ox topped at 133.8c/kg, this market mainly unchanged on last week.  

A large sample of D3 heifers sold up to 119.2c, and these averaged 107.7c/kg.  Cows dominated the yarding, with big samples of D2 heavy cows to 109.2c and a few very heavy types to 110.2c to average around 97c/kg.  Bulls sold at particularly strong rates to sell to 155.2c."
"An increased yarding to 1,357 head this week after the previous week's very small numbers, saw values lift 2c to 4c/kg for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents. The increase was due to some increased restocker, backgrounding for live export and improved quality of the yarding. All but one of the major processors were in attendance and operating, with restockers showing an increased presence and bidding activity throughout the offering. Cattle were drawn from Dimbulah, Georgetown, Einasleigh, Greenvale, Hughenden, Pentland and local areas.

Vealer steers were few in number, with the better quality and heavy types selling to increased values, topping at 361c/kg. Good quality yearling steers sold to very strong restocker competition, topping at 358c, averaging 346c/kg. Vealer heifers were in strong demand and the short supply saw values lift to 324c/kg. Yearling heifers were well supplied and some good lines sold very strongly to return to the paddock for a top of 303c to average 296c/kg. PTIC heifers sold to 278c/kg.

Some good quality bullocks saw values increase 2c to 4c, with 3 score bullocks to slaughter topping at 266c, averaging 265c, while 2 score bullocks to restockers sold to 246c/kg. Some small lines of well grown steers to restockers sold to 258c/kg. Well finished, heavy 3 score cows also saw values increase 2c to 4c, selling to a top of 222c to average 209c, while heavy 2 score cows sold to 212c, averaging 203c/kg. Heavy grown heifers to slaughter sold to 248c/kg. Competition for good heavy bulls was very strong with most bulls destined for live export selling to 230c, averaging 226c, while medium weight bulls sold to 235c/kg."
"An increased yarding of 806 head on previous sale owing to the Easter break, saw 1,864 head drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, with some very good lines of prime bullocks and cows selling 8c to 12c higher and heavy bulls lifting 60c/kg. One of the major processors was again absent, with four other major processors, two live exporters, regular feeder buyers and restockers operating in a large buyer gallery.  Cattle were drawn from Burketown, Chillagoe, Richmond, Hughenden, Greenvale, Ingham, Woodstock, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were in good supply, selling to 354c to restockers, averaging 326c/kg. Yearling steers sold lower on last sale, with heavy steers to feed - destined for live export selling to 289c, while those returning to paddock sold to 321, averaging 314c/kg.

Medium weight 3 score cows to slaughter topped at 240c, to average 209c, while lighter 2 score cows to restockers sold to 186c, averaging 179c/kg.

Medium weight bulls to feed destined for live export sold to 287c/kg. Several smaller lines of cows and calves sold strongly from $1,180 to $1,410, topping at $1,640/unit."
"An increased yarding of 1,864 mixed quality cattle were drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, following no sale last week. A spirited buyer gallery was present and supported by three regular processors, with only selective interest throughout the prime section. Store cattle dominated the yarding, with restocker interest very strong for many lines, whilst feeder operators were also active throughout the sale.  Cattle were drawn from Croydon, Richmond, Greenvale, Belyando, Tully, Ingham, Woodstock and local and coastal areas. 

Vealer heifers were mixed in quality and condition, selling to 298.2c, with many lines selling to 265c/kg. Vealer steers sold to consistently dearer rates, selling to a record 319.2c, with many lines surpassing 300c/kg. Restocker buyers actively competed for a couple of larger lines of very good quality steers and heifers, resulting in the highest prices for cattle sold in Charters Towers. 

3 score bullocks were very short in supply and sold to 275.2c/kg. Some large lines of cows lifted the quality of the cow offering, with 3 score cows selling to 229.2c and 2 score cows selling to 219c/kg.

Several pens of cows and calves were offered with mixed quality and condition present. Lines sold from $380 to $820/unit."
"An increased yarding of 1,806 mixed quality cattle were yarded by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, with new record prices across most categories. Yearling steers and heifers were in strong demand, while cows and bullocks values increased on last sale with all major processors and feeder buyers active throughout the sale. Cattle were drawn from Croydon, Georgetown, Hughenden, Tully, Ingham, Guru, Woodstock, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were in short supply, however bidding from the gallery was very strong, resulting in a new record of 400.2c/kg. Yearling steers lifted in numbers, with feeder buyers underpinning the market, topping at 323.2c/kg, while steers to restockers sold to 326.2c/kg.

"An increased yarding of 1,726 plainer cattle was drawn by Charters Towers Combined Agents, with finished cattle in short supply, whilst a large consignment of bulls from northern areas was on offer. Live export competition was strong for suitable lines, whilst one major processor did not participate on any slaughter cattle.

The yarding also had an increase of grown heifers and steers which saw strong feeder competition, limiting restockers to younger lighter weight cattle.

"An increase in supply of 798 head saw 2,014 cattle in Charters Towers this week, following minimal rain in patchy storms last week. Overall quality was mixed with most prime cattle plainer than last sale supported by some very good lines of young steers and heifers. Some of the regular processors operated at comparable rates to last sale, in conjunction with active central feeder and backgrounder buyers and western restockers. Cattle were drawn from Forsayth and Tully in the north to Belyando in the south, supported by many local lines.

Young steers sold to improved rates lifting by 20c to 40c for better quality lines, while young heifers improved by 8c, however mixed lines of yearling heifers to feed and restockers eased by 17c/kg. Increased numbers of grown steers to feed sold to similar rates for better quality types and grown heifers to the trade improved by 4c/kg.

"An increase in numbers to 1,610 cattle was yarded by Charters Towers Combined Agents this week, with quality improving across all lines.  Regular processors were present and active throughout prime sections, accompanied by a live exporter competing for bullocks in particular.  The yarding was drawn from Richmond, Greenvale, Belyando, Ingham, and Woodstock, along with local and coastal areas.

Vealer & yearling steers were in greater numbers and supported by some larger lines that attracted strong competition from restockers. Vealer steers sold from to 280 to 296c, topping at 313c/kg.  Yearling steers were keenly contested, selling in line with the reduction in live export values, and to a top of 286c/kg. Vealer heifers attracted good interest from all restockers and feeders, with many lines selling for 230 to 265c, and reaching a top of 283c/kg. Yearling heifers were less sought after and sold to 212c/kg. A much improved yarding of 2 and 3 score bullocks attracted the interest of a live exporter, with many lines selling for 240 to 245c, and reaching a top of 260c/kg as a result.  Processors were active on 3 score cows that sold to a top of 211c, whilst lighter 2 score cows were sourced primarily by restockers, selling to 195c/kg.

A small number of bulls sold to 190c, with lighter types suitable for live export made to 268c/kg. A number of smaller mixed cows and calves sold to $970/head."
"An increase in numbers occurred with many producers offloading cattle in the hope of receiving some of the high rates available. Cattle are being moved not only through the saleyards but also between regions as transport operators are being kept very busy as dry conditions persist. The quality of the yarding was mixed with a very good run of grown steers offered, however the cows were not to the standard of last week.

Grown steer quality was as good has been offered at the centre this year despite the seasonal conditions. A full panel of export buyers operated but one did purchase the greatest percentage of the steers. The medium weights ranged from 151.2c to 164.2c and a larger number of heavy steers sold from 157.2c to 165.2c/kg. 

A plainer cow yarding compared to last week was offered with many back in quality and condition. Lightweight cows were in large numbers and the 2 scores gained 3c to average 125.5c/kg. Prices for medium weights fell for the lighter conditioned lines with the 2 and 3 scores loosing between 5c and 7c, however the 4 score lines were able to maintain a fully firm trend averaging 146.4c/kg."
"An improved quality yarding of 967 cattle were drawn by Charters Towers Combined Agents this week, with general improvement in animal condition seen across all classes on offer. Cattle were drawn from Greenvale, Belyando, Ravenswood, Guru, and Ingham, along with local and coastal areas. Bullocks and cows improved on recent sales, with major processors operating on many lines throughout the prime section.  Restocker activity was strong on selected lines of steers and heifers, most notably on well grown vealers.

Vealer steers were strongly contested and sold to a top of 354c/kg, with many lines selling to 340c/kg. Yearling steers were limited in selection, selling to 282c, and averaging 258c/kg. Vealer heifer were limited in supply and sold strongly to a number of restockers, topping at 261c/kg.  A limited number of Yearling heifers sold to a top of 268c/kg.

An increased number of good condition 3 score bullocks sold to 263c, with many selling above 250c, while 2 score bullocks sold to 243c/kg.  An improved quality yarding of cows eased 3 to 8c, with 3 score cows selling to a top of 214c/kg.  2 score cows were in good supply week-on-week, selling to 187c, with most lines ranging from 167 to 174c/kg. Cows and calves were in good supply and sold to a top of $1400, with the plainer lines selling from $700 to 970/head. Bulls were dominated by mixed quality types and sold to a top of 202c/kg."
"An even smaller yarding was at Charters Towers to see 215 head yarded. Steers were in the largest numbers, while there was only a few bull yarded and the values varied for all descriptions. 

The D4 bullocks weighing 500 to 600kg sold to an average of 128.1c, up 4c on last week with a top of 129.2c/kg. The heavy weight bullocks sold to the best price for the day of 130.6c to return the vendor $840/head in small numbers. 

The best of the cows were medium weight D4s that sold to 117c which was 4c/kg up on last week."
"Although the supply area is too far north for the fair rainfall recorded in other centres, numbers still fell compared to the previous market. Quality was a little better with the trade buyers present competing strongly to secure adequate numbers while restockers competed successfully for the store cattle offered. Steers and heifers were limited in number while cows were well represented percentage wise.

The few medium pens of C muscled steers traded from 148c to 160c while the lower muscled drafts sold from 133c to 142c/kg. 

Cows were 5c dearer with light pens trading from 88c for the D1 pens to a top of 145c/kg for good quality C muscled lines. Medium and heavy drafts sold from 121c to 144c/kg. The top price recorded for bulls was 142c/kg."
"All the usual processors, local butchers and other buyers were present and bidding on a slightly smaller yarding. Plain quality cattle are appearing in increasing numbers as the effect of the current dry season begins to show. Some good quality pens of grown steers and cows were offered but they were countered with some poorer quality pennings.

Grown steers sold to strong competition, the medium weight D2s averaging 152.9¢ after reaching 157.9¢/kg. Heavy weights comprised mostly D3s which sold at 163.4¢ after topping at 167.2¢/kg. Heifers were in limited number and sold to a mixed trend.

Cows dominated the yarding with large lines of plain types offered, E1s averaging 77.8¢, E2s averaging 115¢/kg. Heavier D3 types reached 153.2¢ with most sales around 144.5¢/kg. Light E1 bulls were the most prominent in their category and averaged 74¢/kg."
"All the regular export buyers were present plus the usual local and coastal butcher competition. Following the trend of the rest of the state s yardings export grades eased as processors operated at reduced rates. Quality overall was mixed with some well-finished pens of bullocks offset by some lighter descriptions. The cow yarding was also varied with a wide range of conditions offered.

The large lines of C muscled bullocks sold to mixed demand to top at 140.2c to average 138.2c/kg. Heavier C4 types topped at 158.2c with most sales at 155.7c/kg. Grown heifers sold to an easing trend with C muscled lines in the majority, they ranges from 121.2c to 138.2c to average 127.6c/kg. 

Large lines of medium weight D3 cows could not avert the falling prices and sold at reduced levels of between 116.2c and 136.2c/kg. Lighter weight cows of similar frame averaged 115c/kg. The best of the bulls sold for 120.2c/kg."
"All the regular buyers were in attendance and despite numbers more than doubling prices held firm to slightly dearer form most grades. Some lighter steers of poorer quality lost 4c while all other steers were firm. The heifers sold slightly dearer in places while the poorer quality light cows lost 7c/kg. There was some better quality cows penned that were in fair supply and these generally gained 1c to 2c/kg. 

The light steers sold to an isolated 126.2c while the poorer grades averaged 110.8c/kg. The medium weight steers varied in quality and the better grades averaged 129.3c after they reached 132.2c while the poorer grades averaged 116.7c/kg. The good quality heavy steers sold to 137.2c and they averaged 133.3c/kg. 

The best heifers sold to 122c and they averaged 112.9c while the very light grades sold around 87c/kg. Light cows sold to 112.2c and the D3s averaged 107.3c while the D2s averaged 89.1c/kg. The large number of medium weight D3s topped at 120.2c and averaged 114.3c/kg. 

Light bulls sold around 75c while the heavy weights topped at 123.2c/kg."
"All the regular buyers turned out for one of the dearest sales seen at these yards for some time. Strong competition forced a dearer trend for all grades including plain quality descriptions with large improvements recorded on last week s levels. Steer quality was similar to last week, heifers were slightly better conditioned while there was some good cows offered from the local area.

Medium weight C2 and C3 steers averaged between 165.4c and 175.1c/kg. Heavy steers jumped 8c to average 181.9c after topping at 187.2c/kg. Bullock prices also improved to sell at mostly 185.2c/kg. Grown heifers sold at levels between 135.7c and 150.7c/kg. 

Cow quality was good and prices reflected this by showing large improvements. Light D3s averaged 146.3c after topping at 154.2c/kg. Medium weights ranged from 142.2c to 163.2c to average 152.9c/kg. A good selection of bulls including several pens of cleanskin descriptions sold mostly around 167c/kg."
"All the regular buyers attended but not all operated as a select few processors competed to secure the limited available lines. Quality varied from very poor steers and cows to well finished descriptions, which were in small numbers. Demand was strong enough to push a dearer trend for all grades.

Light grown steers ranged from 140c to 177.2c while medium lines improved to average 188.2c/kg. The majority of heavy steers averaged over 200c/kg. Grown heifers were of plain quality but sold to dearer levels.

Plain, light cows comprised the majority of the cow yarding with the plainer lines holding firm at 119.9c/kg. Light D3s ranged from 139.2c to 167.2c while a select few very poor cows made 75c/kg. Medium weight cows ranged from 135.2c to 179.2c/kg. Bulls sold to processors at dearer rates."
"After the large sale last week, numbers dropped by around half. Most of the cattle offered were plainer lines. Very little rain resulted from the wet season and this is forcing producers to offload. All the regular local and export buyers were present and active on a yarding that was dominated by light cows. 

Light steers sold to 121.2c with most selling closer to 104.4c/kg. The good medium and heavy steers met solid demand from processors to reach 165.2c/kg. A large number of light plain export heifers were penned and averaged just over 102c/kg. 

The cows sold to strong demand and this helped to lift values. A large number of light D2s averaged 105.8c as the better medium weight D3s made to 128.2c/kg."
"After the increased yarding last week, numbers dropped dramatically. The quality of the yarding was mainly plain, although there were a few better types scattered throughout. The regular buyers were in operation with the better descriptions selling to good demand. Dominating the yarding were the females and in particular the cows. 

The light steers sold to 150.2c, as the medium weights reached 173.2c/kg. The top of the steers were the heavy types selling to 180.2c, while the small number of heavy bullocks sold for 175.2c/kg to return over $1,000/head.

The light heifers could not maintain the rates of the last sale with the D3s slipping 12c to average 137.5c/kg. The light cows also suffered losses, despite the D2s selling to 125.2c/kg. Receiving further gains was the large number of medium weights D3s after selling to 152.2c/kg.

The bulls sold to good competition and the heavy weights received the largest gains of the sale. The light bulls sold to 129.6c, as the heavy weights reached 170c/kg to return over $1,500/head."
"After last weeks very small yarding a larger number was offered. There was some better quality steers penned considering the season along with a fair number of heifers and light cows.  All buyers were in attendance and processor competition was quite strong however the steers eased 1c to 2c/kg. The heifers were 4c cheaper while the light cows gained 4c to 9c and the medium weights lost 14c/kg. 

Light steers made to 130.2c and averaged 128.4c/kg. The medium weight steers sold to 148c and the C3s averaged 141.3c while those showing less finish averaged 132.2c/kg. Close to 140 heavy steers peaked at 148.2c and averaged 144.8c/kg.  

Heifers reached 120c and the D2s averaged 106.3c/kg. The light cows sold to 110.2c, which saw the better grades average from 99c to 107c/kg. The medium weight cows sold to 125.2c and the D3s averaged 115.7c/kg. A small number of bulls were penned and the heavy weights sold to 131.2c/kg."
"After last weeks exceptionally large yarding, numbers returned to normal figures. All the usual meatworks buyers were present along with local butchers and wholesalers. Quality was similar to the previous sale with a wide range of descriptions offered. Competition at the beginning of each run began well but tended to taper off towards the end. 

Grown steers sold to a cheaper market with medium weight C and D muscles both easing up to 3c to average 146.8c for C2s and 124.5c/kg for D2s. Japan ox consisted of some well finished lines which averaged 144.7c while the plainer types were not too far behind selling at mostly 142.2c/kg. D muscled heifers ranged from 112c to 125c to average 115.5c/kg.

Medium weight cows comprised the majority of the cow yarding with large runs of D3s selling to a slightly cheaper market. They ranged from 114.2c to 131.2c to average 120.5c/kg. The best of the bulls sold for 113.2c/kg."
"A yarding of just over 1,000 head were penned, which included up to 600 store cattle. The quality of slaughter cattle was quite plain and a number of processors and local butchers provided competition. The majority of cattle were offloaded by producers who are currently overstocked and are in areas where they have missed out of much of the rain. The immediate surrounding region is beginning to respond to with feedstocks improving.

Of the grown steers offered prices ranged from 161c to 170c/kg for the heavy weight lines.

Light D2 cows dominated the yarding and sold from 105c to 135c/kg. Of the reasonable number of heavyweights sold prices averaged 130.2c/kg."
"A yarding of 3,409 cattle was penned in a combined prime and store sale this week, down 168 head on last sale. Quality was very mixed, featuring some very good lines of heavy cows, increased numbers of heavy bullocks and large lines of yearling steers along with lesser quality northern pastoral cows. The regular buyer panel were present and operating at similar rates along with a new live exporter and opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Croydon, Georgetown, Julia Ck, Hughenden, Belyando, local and coastal areas. Grown steers and heifers were mostly firm, heavy bullocks were firm to 15c higher, heavy cows were firm to 4c easier and heavy bulls averaged 5c/kg lower.

Light steer calves returning to the paddock sold to a top of 560c, with mixed sexes averaging 472c/kg. Light vealer steers to restockers reached 564c to average 560c and a good sample of steers above 280kg reached 462c to average 456c/kg. Mixed quality vealer heifers to the trade sold to 466c to average 447c, while heifers above 200kg returning to the paddock also reached 462c to average 458c/kg.

Market Reporter, Mick Kingham."
"A yarding of 3,148 cattle were penned in Charters Towers, 27 fewer than last sale. Increased numbers of heavy prime cows and bullocks were on offer, supported by large lines of store steers and heifers, with most cattle from local areas and north to Georgetown with some western lines. One southern processor joined the regular buying panel, operating at increased rates for heavy, good yielding lines, supported by regular feeder buyers and selective restocker and backgrounder activity, mostly due to the deteriorating season in many parts.  

Young steers saw quality related adjustments with better types improving slightly on last sale, while young heifers eased 4c to 8c/kg. Yearling steers also saw quality related adjustments, with feeder types easing 8c to 12c/kg, and restocker types firm on last sale. Light and medium weight yearling heifers eased 4c to 8c throughout, while heavier types to the trade improved 14c/kg. Improved lines of grown steers sold up to 15c higher on last week, however a large sample of grown heifers averaged 4c to 8c/kg lower. Selected lines of heavy bullocks increased by 8c to 10c, with plainer types 10c/kg easier on last week.

Medium weight 2 score cows to processors eased more than 10c, while heavy weights increased by 5c with light cows to feed increasing from 10c to 20c/kg. Heavy bulls to processors improved 14c, while medium weights and bulls to feed destined for live export averaged 10c to 35c/kg lower. Increased numbers of heavy export bullocks sold to 319c to average 299c to 307c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows sold to 196c to average near 171c, with light weight types to feed averaging 152c to 167c/kg. A large sample of D muscled lower yielding heavy cows averaged 222c, with better quality heavy 3 score cows attracting increased demand selling to 249c to average 242c/kg. Prime heavy weight cows topped at 250c to average near 246c/kg.

Some good lines of cows and calves sold to $800/unit."
"A yarding of 2,844 cattle were presented in Charters Towers, a reduction of 304 head on last sale. The prime cattle offering comprised of mixed quality lines, however some very good heavy lines of bullocks and cows, attracted strong demand for heavy yielding types from processors. Store cattle displayed improved weight on recent weeks, with quality contributing to the improvement. All regular processors and feeder/backgrounder buyers were in attendance and operating relative to quality for the cattle drawn from Mt Isa, Normanton, Richmond, Greenvale, Mt Coolon, local and coastal areas. Light weight vealer steers to restockers lifted 20c, while heifers to processors eased by more than 20c/kg. Medium weight yearling steers to feed averaged 17c lower, while those below 280kg to feed improved in price by up to 30c/kg.

One regular processor and feeder buyer were absent this week, with all others operating selectively and often at reduced rates in line with quality on offer, supported by one live exporter and several restockers.

Cattle were drawn from Julia Creek, Normanton, Einasleigh, Georgetown, Greenvale, Ingham, Ayr, Belyando, local and coastal areas. 

A small number of vealer steers sold similar to last sale, selling to 354c to average 343c/kg. Yearling steers eased on last sale, mainly due to offering of smaller lines and variable quality.

"A total of 305 prime cattle were yarded at Charters Towers on Thursday, which was down by 134 head on last week.  Overall, values were dearer, the exception were a few of the plainer cows that showed an easing trend.

The light steers that were offered sold to an isolated 120.2c/kg, while D3 steers in the 400 to 500kg weight range made to 128.2c to average 121.3c/kg.  The best of the bullocks peaked at 130.2c to average 127.3c/kg, and were 7c/kg dearer than last Thursday.

"A substantially smaller yarding of export cattle was at the Charters Towers sale on Thursday. Values remained firm for the majority, although some of the female grades recorded losses. 

A pen of C3 medium weight steers sold to 158.2c/kg.  A single heavy B3 sold to 160.2c/kg as a steer weighing over 600kg sold to 163.2c to return $1,045/head. Only light heifers were offered and the top of these was the D3s reaching 146.2c to average 141.5c, up 7c/kg on last week. 

The light D2 cows topped at 138.2c, as did the medium weight D2s in the largest numbers. But once again it was the heavier grades that topped the cow section, as a D3 reached 144.2c/kg.

Heavy bulls were in the largest numbers to top at 135.2c/kg."
"A substantially larger yarding was offered to a full field of buyers. Values, while improved on the last sale, were not up to state averages. Cattle were drawn mainly from the local areas, although drafts were penned from coastal regions and Hughenden. Even though rain has been received in many surrounding areas, pasture growth has been rather limited and this was a factor in such a large number of store cattle being offered.

Most of the steers yarded were D2 lightweights averaging just under 127c/kg. Medium weights suited to the Korean market sold to good demand to sell to 176.2c as the heavy steers receiving solid strong competition topped at 178.2c/kg. 

Only a handful of light export heifers were offered selling to a slightly dearer market with the D3s making to 145.2c/kg. A large number of cows were included in the line up with the majority lightweights averaging 122c/kg. The better medium weight D3s, had benefited from being from areas that had received early rains and subsequent pasture growth, selling to 142.2c to average 135.5c/kg."
"A substantially larger yarding at Churchill was met with a relatively firm market with only the medium weight cows suffering a loss. In a yarding dominated by export types, steers were in the largest numbers. With numbers for some types low, it is difficult to get an accurate quote on sections of the yarding. 

Large numbers of medium weight D3 steers sold to 149.2c to average 142.8c as bullocks weighing between 500 and 600kg reached 145.2c to also average 142.8c/kg. 

Light D3 heifers sold to 140.2c with the only other heifers in any numbers being the light D4s, which reached 134.2c/kg. The light D2 cows remained unchanged to average 98.8c, but the medium weight D3s suffered a 2c loss to average 107.8c/kg.

The largest number of bulls was the medium weight D1s that sold to 115.4c/kg."
"A smaller yarding was offered with quality quite mixed across all categories. all the major export buyers attended the sale but not all operated to full capacity, with the shorter kill week next week attributing to the weaker demand. Prices generally eased in the face of the broken demand with grown cattle categories falling between 4c and 10c/kg. The season has tapered off sharply in the surrounding region and many don t expect further rain till late winter. 

Grown steers lost considerable value with limited demand evident for all weight ranges. Quality was similar to the previous sale and prices for medium weights averaged 151.5c, while heavier steers ranged from 147.2c to 155.2c, with both categories loosing between 5c and 8c/kg. A small number of bullocks averaged 160.2c and the C muscled grown heifers sold to varied competition averaging 130c/kg.

The quality of the cow yarding was well below last weeks market and prices eased accordingly. Light conditioned cows that were receiving between 100c and 110c last week, all sold for under a 100c, with little interest shown. Medium weights ranged from 123.2c to 136.2c falling 4c while lighter conditioned 2 scores lost 6c to average 117.5c/kg"
"A smaller yarding was offered with quality generally quite plain. Most cattle showed the effect of the season and prices reflected this. A full panel of buyers were in attendance but one major processor appeared to be stronger than the other works. 

Grown steers and bullocks were of slightly mixed quality with overall large consignments of bullocks the most keenly sought. Medium weight steers ranged from 164.2c to 167.2c/kg and most of the heavy steers sold in the 170s. The large consignment of bullocks sold from 176.2c to 181.2c/kg averaging $1,157/head.

Cows were dominated by medium weights with most in pretty plain quality. Medium weights eased slightly selling from 130.2c to 149.2c and a small number of good heavyweights held around 152c/kg."
"A smaller yarding today at Charters Towers and as usual was made up predominantly of export types. The overall market slipped slightly for most grades, however some descriptions lost value significantly, despite the lesser numbers.

The reduced quality had an effect on the steers with most types losing up to 10c/kg.  The only grade to witness a rise was the small number of light D3s, which averaged 133.9c/kg. In the largest number, D3 bullocks slipped 9c to average 142.1c and topping the sale was the heavy bullocks reaching 148.6c/kg. 

Going against the sale trend, were the light D3 heifers in large numbers, which improved 10c after selling to a top of 145.2c/kg.  A small number of light cows topped at 100.2c, to average 91.8c/kg. Medium weight cows were in the largest numbers but also sold on a cheaper trend, with a large number of D3 types losing 3c to average 115.9c after reaching a top of 125.2c/kg. 

The top of the bulls was a D mucle heavy weight selling to 138.2c/kg."
"A smaller yarding of 805 cattle were penned following the Easter weekend and a scheduled store sale for Friday with 2400 head booked. Quality was quite good with some well finished local lines of prime cows with reduced numbers of grown steers, bullocks and bulls. A smaller gallery consisted of the regular processors operating selectively supported by one southern feeder operator. Steers to feed improved 15c/kg, bullocks lifted 4/kg heavy cows averaged 6c to 15c/kg higher and bulls sold firm. Cattle were drawn from Richmond, Pentland, Greenvale, local and coastal areas.

A small sample of grown steers above 400kg to feed sold to 392.2c to average 356c to 376c/kg and suitable steers to the trade reached 390.2c to average above 390c/kg. Fewer numbers of grown heifers to feed sold to 358.2c to average 332c to 349c/kg. Several small lines of heavy full-mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 394.2c to average 384c to 393c/kg. 

Solid buyer support for cows saw increased competition for the quality penned. Medium weight 2 score cows made to 282.2c to average same, 3 score cows to processors reached 314.2c to average 299c to 310c and prime heavyweights topped at 318.2c to average 310c/kg. Cows to feed reached 290.2c to average 270c to 286c/kg. A small sample of heavy bulls to feed destined for live export topped at 340.2c to average 317c to 336c/kg.

"A smaller yarding of 2,009 cattle were penned in Charters Towers, 966 fewer than last week. The prime cattle were of mixed quality throughout, with several lines lacking weight and quality of last sale. The regular buying panel operated at lower rates than last sale, with all heavy prime cattle selling to lower rates in line with recent grid adjustments, however medium weight cows averages increased.  Fewer store cattle met strong restocker demand for good quality lines, with most prices easing on previous week. Cattle were drawn from Chillagoe, Richmond, Pentland, Greenvale, local and coastal areas along with one mixed consignment from Katherine in Northern Territory.

Light vealer steers met strong demand from restockers easing by 6c on last week's rates and vealer heifers to restockers averaged 9c lower, with suitable types to processors lifting by 9c/kg. Limited numbers of yearling steers to feed eased by 15c to 20c and yearling heifers eased by more than 30c/kg in line with quality. Fewer numbers of grown heifers to the trade eased by 8c/kg. Heavy bullocks to export processor averaged 22c/kg lower. Medium weight cows went against the trend increasing by 8c, however heavy prime cows sold 14c to 18c lower and heavy bulls averaged more than 30c/kg lower throughout.

Vealer steers returning to grass sold to 325c to average more than 312c and vealer heifers to restockers averaged from 205c to 214c/kg. Yearling steers to feed sold to 289c to average more than 240c, while steers above 330kg to feed averaged 273c/kg. Limited numbers of mixed quality light yearling heifers to feed averaged 199c/kg. A small supply of grown heifers to the trade sold to 253c to average 223c/kg.

Increased numbers of heavy bullocks presented in many small consignments with those to export processor selling to 288c, with medium weights selling to 293c to average 263c/kg. Medium weight cows to processors reached 198.2c to average near 180c, while heavy prime cows topped at 238.2c to average 211c/kg. Heavy bulls to feed back grounded for live export sold to 295.2 to average 242c, while heavy bulls to processor reached 270c to average 233c to 250c/kg. Mixed quality cows and calves sold to $720/unit."
"A smaller yarding of 1339 cattle were penned, 966 fewer than last sale. Quality was very mixed, with a reduced number of well finished cows and bullocks and several smaller mixed lines of store steers and heifers.  Some regular processors were absent from the buyer panel, with those in attendance operating at reduced rates with the support of most regular feeders and opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown and east to local and coastal areas. 

Values for most categories came under further pressure with bullock easing 13c, cows slipped 20c and bulls with no live export presence fell by up to 50c/kg.

Light steers to restockers sold to 226c, similar heifers returning to the paddock reached 160c/kg. A reduced supply of yearling steers below 280 kg to restockers made to 204c, averaging 199c/kg. Yearling heifers above 280kg to feed reached 155c to average 134c/kg.

A reduced number of grown steers to feed reached 175c to average 170c, a few heavy grown steers to processors made 158c/kg. A limited number of grown heifers to processors sold to 144c to average 133c/kg.

Medium weight 2 score cows to processors sold to 143c to average 124c, 3 scores sold to 152c to average 138c/kg.  A small sample of prime heavyweight cows reached 154c/kg.

Heavy bulls to processors topped at 160c to average 146c/kg.

"A smaller yarding of 1,127 mixed quality cattle were yarded by Charters Towers Combined Agents. There was limited buyer competition for the prime cattle, with one meatworks operator present, but not active on the day, whilst store buyers keenly bid on selected lines. Cattle were drawn from the Northern Gulf, Richmond, Greenvale, Belyando, Woodstock, Ingham, local and coastal areas. 

Yearling steers were in limited supply and better quality types sold to keen competition, topping at 263.2c/kg, with one western restocker active across the store section of the sale. Yearling heifers were sold to a spirited buying panel to top at 252.2c/kg.

"A small yarding was offered with cattle being drawn mainly from the local area. All the regular processors, wholesalers and local butchers were present and active. Quality was similar to last week with the majority of the yarding D2 and D3s. The pastures in the local area are starting to feel the effects of the cooling weather.

A good line of cows and calves sold to $1,450/unit."
"A small increase in numbers resulted in 1,477 cattle in a Combined Prime and Store Sale. Quality was very mixed with some good quality northern single vendor lines of cows and bullocks along with some poor quality cows and bulls. Two good quality lines of store steers were on offer supported by smaller lines of steers and heifers. One major export processor was again in attendance but not operating, with other regular processors operating with renewed enthusiasm on better quality lines. Additional feeder orders were operating supported by enthusiastic southern and western restocker participation. Cattle were drawn from mostly northern areas including Burketown, Normanton and Mareeba, then to Richmond, Hughenden, Mt Coolon local and coastal areas.

Most categories improved in price, with grown steers and heifers increasing 20c to 60c, bullocks lifted 23c to 47c, cows to processors increased 10c to 20c and bulls averaged 11c to 37c/kg better.

Market Reporter, Mick Kingham."
"A small decrease in supply by 155 head resulted in 2105 cattle penned this week. Quality was very mixed, representing the lengthening dry season and smaller mixed lines being presented for sale. All regular processors operated on the fewer numbers of prime cattle offered along with one live exporter, regular feeders and opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from across the north down to the local area.

Processor demand was good for the reduced supply of well finished types, most  categories were firm to 5c dearer, particularly for the better quality types and those displaying weight, however plainer steers and cows eased 12c to 15c/kg. Restocker demand continued to improve for good quality, well bred younger cattle.

A good sample of young lightweight suitably weaned steers returning to the paddock averaged 271c to 306c, reaching a top of 358c/kg. Similar heifers also returning to grass made to 254c to average 240c, well covered heifers to processors averaged 241c/kg.  Very good quality young steers above 200kg to backgrounders reached 358c to average 317c, lesser types averaged 269c/kg. Light yearling steers above 200kg returning to the paddock made to 328c for a small sample of well bred types, the majority selling from 218c to 298c to average 236c/kg. Steers above 330kg to feed averaged 229c to 305, selling to 328c, steers to live export made 290c/kg. Yearling heifers above 280kg to feed sold to 262c to average 257c/kg.

Grown steers above 400kg suitable for live export sold to 284c, steers to the trade reached 302c to average 296c/kg. Heavy grown steers to processors sold to an isolated 326c most from 310c to 318c/kg.  Heavy well finished grown heifers to processors sold to 312c, a good sample averaging 269c/kg. A small number of heavy full mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 310c multiple times to average 308c/kg. Medium weight 3 score cows to processors sold to 272c to average 256c, a limited number of prime heavyweight 3 and 4 score cows made from 268c to 290c/kg. Heavy bulls suitable for live export made from 250 to 294c, most around 280c/kg.

"A slightly smaller yarding of similar quality saw values ease although not to the extent of some centres. Not all the regular buyers were in attendance and those that were only operated on specific categories. 

Light steers lost 18c and averaged 109.7c/kg Medium weights were in the largest numbers and sold 16c to 20c/kg cheaper. The large number of D3s offered averaged 141c after they sold to a top of 152.2c/kg. Heavy steers reached 154.2c to average 18c lower at 150.2c/kg. 

Grown heifers felt the brunt of the cheaper rates and a large number averaged 114.7c/kg. Light cows were 6c to 11c cheaper and large number of D2s averaged 98.3c and the better quality descriptions averaged 119.6c/kg. There was over 200 medium weight D3s that averaged 8c cheaper at 120.7c/kg. 

The bull market lost 7c to 19c and average prices ranged from 102.2c to 113.6c/kg."
"A slightly smaller yarding of improved quality cattle was offered to a larger panel of buyers. Normally there are only two processors in operation, but this week there was four, the extra competition pushed steers up by at least 5c and the cows gained over 10c/kg in places.  

Medium weight steers sold to 187.2c, as the heavy steers averaged 184.1c after selling to 193.6c/kg. The top of the heavy bullocks reached 194.6c/kg and returned over $1,200/head. 

Females represented over half the yarding with demand reported as strong. The heifers were not able to sustain last weeks high values, however the light D3s reached 172.2c/kg. Most of the cows offered were light weights and the increased number had a negative effect on values, albeit only slightly. The D2s averaged 130.4c, while the D3s topped at 138.2c/kg. The medium weights received further gains with the better types selling to 175.2c/kg. 

Both the light and medium weight bulls received further gains, while the medium weights suffered a 7c/kg fall."
"A slightly smaller yarding of 1,297 cattle were drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week. The yarding attracted several small lines of prime cows and northern mixed lines, supported by some very good lines of vealer steers and heifers. One processor continued their absence, with all others operating, supported by two live exporters, regular feeder buyers and some opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Croydon, Belyando, Ingham, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers sold to mixed demand from a subdued buying panel. Light steer calves sold to 282c and light vealers topped at 272c, to average 258c, while heavier types returned to grass sold to 246c/kg. Small lines of yearling steers were very mixed, with those above 280kg selling to 228c, an increase of 12c, and medium weight feeder steers above 330kg lifted 15c, to average 230c/kg. Similar weight steers meeting live export specifications sold to 246c/kg. A mixed quality offering of vealer heifers sold stronger for the better grown heavier types, lifting 15c to top at 210c, with light vealer heifers 14c easier, to average 200c/kg. A very good line of yearling heifers above 330kg to feed sold to 229c, averaging 214c, with similar types to restockers making to 224c/kg.

Bullocks were variable in quality and weight, with the best heavy 3 score bullocks to processors selling to 240c, with lighter conditioned bullocks to feed selling to 225c/kg. A larger offering of grown steers generally sold stronger, with heavy 3 score steers to slaughter selling to 248c, while lighter grown steers to live export sold to 240c, with most sales between 230c and 238c/kg. Increased numbers of heavy 3 score cows sold firm on last sale, with extra heavy cows topping at 196c, to average 190c and heavy 3 score cows selling to 193c, to average 185c/kg. Heavy D3 score cows sold to 185c, to average 171c, while a larger number of medium weight D2 cows eased 2c, to average 133c/kg. Light cows to restockers sold to 136c/kg. Grown heifer prices improved, with C3 heifers selling to 221c and heavier D3 heifers to 206c, lifting 10c, to average 186c/kg. Grown heifers returning to paddock sold to 199c, to average 168c/kg. The continued live export demand for heavy bulls lifted prices by more than 10c, topping at 277c, with most sales between 255c and 272c, and a small number of slaughter bulls sold to 240c/kg. Light males attracted limited demand selling to 240c/kg. Mixed quality cows and calves sold to $960/unit."
"A slightly reduced yarding was offered to all the regular trade and export buyers. Most of the cattle were drawn from the local area, and as it quickly dries out, the quality of the cattle is falling on a weekly basis. Once the top few pens were sold, and onto the plainer lines, competition quickly fell away.  

The plainer muscled medium weight grown steers suffered falls to average from 138c to 146c/kg. A small pen of better quality medium weights averaged 152.2c/kg. Good heavy steers met solid demand and reached 163.2c/kg. Grown heifers sold to a generally firm market for the small numbers that were offered. 

A fair percentage of the yarding comprised of cows as values held surprisingly well to be firm to 3c/kg cheaper. Lightweights sold to 138c as the better lines averaged from 114c to 124c/kg. Medium weight D3s were in large numbers to average almost 130c, while heavy weights reached 140.2c/kg."
"A slightly reduced offering saw a total offering of 553 head at the weekly prime market. Rises were consistent with other physical markets throughout the state, with increases of up to 17c/kg. 

Grown steers saw only a few lightweights offered to average 128.8c/kg. Medium weights reached a top of 147.6c/kg, while heavy steers averaged at 145.6.

A fair sample of heifers, with females dominating the yardings, ranged form 114.2c to 131.2c to average 129c/kg. Lightweight D3 cows averaged 124.2, while the same grade in medium weights averaged 124.1c/kg. 

A smaller number of bulls saw a top rate of 142.2c, and averaged at 137.8c/kg."
"A slightly larger yarding was offered to a full panel of buyers. As has been the case at southern markets, competition was strong with most grades selling on a dearer trend. The quality of the yarding was the best seen for a few months with very few tail end drafts being penned. 

Only a small number of light steers were penned with the better descriptions selling to 200.2c/kg. The heavier steers realised gains of over 20c in places as medium weights reached 222.2c as heavy steers sold to 234.2c/kg. The highlight of the sale was the heavy bullocks topping at 235.2c/kg and returning over $1,500/head. 

Heifers have been met with solid support all week and this was no different here as the single C3 reached 200.2c/kg. The only grade going against the rising market were the light D2 cows, which suffered a 5c, fall to average 149.3c/kg. The better light cows reached 189.2c as medium D3s averaged 189.5c/kg. The top of the cow section was some very good medium weights reaching 201c/kg. A single heavy weight returned over $1,300/head after selling to 200.6c/kg. 

The bull market was also strong as light weights made to 166.2c and the better heavy weights averaged 200.1c/kg."
"A slightly larger yarding was offered to a full contingent of buyers. Quality was similar to some other markets and was varied. Steers dominated the sale with fair number of cows also penned. 

Light steers averaged 139.8c as medium weight C3s sold to 170.2c to average 158.9c/kg. Other medium weights averaged 151.8c/kg. Heavy steers sold to 176.2c as a single heavy bullock reached 185c/kg. Light export heifers sold to 149.2c as the D2s averaged 118.3c/kg. 

Light D2 cows averaged 117.8c as D3s sold to 132.2c/kg. Medium weight D3s in the largest number topped at 149.2c and averaged 136.1c/kg. Plain light bulls averaged 89.9c as medium weights reached 127.2c/kg."
"A slightly larger yarding of prime cattle plus another 500 store conditioned cattle was offered to local wholesalers, processors and restockers.  The local area is starting to look really dry with feed and water becoming an issue and no real wet season rain has been received. Quality was generally plain except for the steers, which included a good line up. An accurate trend is difficult for nearly all grades due to the limited numbers.

There was a run of steers included in the yarding with a couple of processors active in purchasing them paying to 149.2c/kg. These were the majority of the yarding. 

The light export heifers sold to 113.2c as the light and medium weight cows reached 116.2c/kg. A pen of medium weight bulls sold for 126.2c/kg."
"A slightly larger yarding of fair quality sold to a near full field of buyers although competition was not as strong as earlier in the year. The top of the market was good quality but the bottom end tapered off especially in the cow categories. Values trended either side of firm although the majority was slightly dearer.

Most of the medium weight steers sold dearer and averaged 127.1c while some better quality descriptions averaged 136.8c after they reached 146.2c/kg. A handful of heavy steers averaged close to 135c/kg. 

Grown heifers were marginally cheaper and reached 137.2c to average126.3c/kg. Light cows sold on a cheaper trend the poorer quality stock averaged 106.8c while the better types saw most sales around 117c/kg. There were over 100 D3 medium weights that sold slightly dearer and averaged 123.8c after they reached 130.2c/kg.

Bulls sold to a top of 122.6c and most sales were around 120c/kg."
"A slight reduction of 1,966 cattle were drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, featuring some good lines of prime cows and one large line of northern steers. One major processor continued their absence, while all other processors were in attendance and operating, with one live exporter, regular feeder buyers and local and western restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Croydon, Mt Surprise, Richmond, Hughenden, Prairie, Ingham, Greenvale, Belyando and local areas.

A mixed supply of vealer steers sold lower this week, influenced by quality, reaching 363c/kg to western restockers. Yearling steer numbers increased, with one good quality large line selling to 370c for lighter types to average 345c, while the heavier draft sold to 332c to average 305c/kg. A small number of steers to feed sold to 290c/kg. Vealer heifers were well supplied, with slaughter types selling to 270c to average 255c, while heifers returning to grass sold to 286c to average 267c/kg. Several small lines of yearling heifers of mixed quality sold to 260c to feed, with heifers returning to paddock topping at 256c/kg.

Bullocks were of mixed quality and the small number, sold lower on last sale, owing to the mixed quality, topping at 268c to slaughter, while lighter conditioned types returned to grass to 250c/kg. A small number of grown steers to restockers sold to 270c/kg. A continued large yarding of cows sold 2c to 5c/kg lower on last sale, despite some well finished good lines of cows on offer. Heavy 3 score cows sold to 232c, to average 220c, while D muscled cows sold to 220c to average 209c/kg. Lighter cows to restockers sold to 222c to average 212c/kg. Well finished grown heifers to slaughter sold to 255c/kg. A smaller number of bulls of mixed quality and weight sold to 262c to slaughter, while bulls to live export sold to 260c/kg. Some good quality lines of young bulls less than 200kg to restockers sold to 376c, to average 365c/kg. Light cows and calves sold to $1,480/unit."
"A slight reduction in numbers by 90 head to 2,654 cattle were yarded by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, with some good lines of well finished bullocks and cows along with a large line of northern yearling steers and heifers a feature of the yarding. One regular processor was again absent this week, however prime cattle increased by 2c to 3c/kg on last sale, light cows lifted up to 30c/kg, while feeder buyers and restockers continued recent strong sale values throughout the store section. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Einasleigh, Richmond, Tully, Ingham, Ayr, Woodstock, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

Vealer steers were again in demand for the small number on offer, with restockers active for lighter weight lines, which sold to 414.2c/kg. The larger lines of yearling steers attracted strong restocker interest, with steers returning to paddocks topping at 383.2c, for an average of 382.4, while feeder buyers sourcing suitable weight steers topped at 358.2c, to average 338.4c/kg. Some grown steers to feed sold to 348.2c/kg. Vealer heifers sold strongly for the smaller number on offer, selling to 360.2c, with very good well conditioned vealers selling to 340.2c/kg.  Yearling heifers dominated the female store offering, selling to 334.2c to feeder buyers while restockers paid to 321.2c/kg for lighter types. Grown heifers to feed sold to 330.2c, to average 319.1c/kg.

Some excellent lines of well finished 3 score bullocks sold to 299.2c to slaughter, to average 291.3c/kg. A number of 2 score bullocks to feed destined for live export, sold to 275.2c/kg. Grown steers to feed sold to 348.2c/kg. Another very good yarding of prime cows this week saw values lift 2c to 3c for the best heavy 3 score cows, topping at 267.2c, to average 250.4c, while heavy 2 score cows to slaughter sold to 263.2c, to average 234.4c/kg. Light cows returning to the paddock lifted significantly, selling to 248c to average 234.2c/kg to western restockers. A good selection of heavy 3 score bulls to slaughter sold to 257.2c, while medium and heavy bulls to live export sold to 280.2c/kg. Younger feeder weight bulls sold to 328.2c, while young light weight males to restockers sold to 342.2c/kg. Cows and calves consisted of several smaller lines, with the sale top of $1,840, with most sales $1,120 to $1,450/unit."
"A similar yarding to the last sale was drawn by Charters Towers Combined Agents this week, with some larger lines of cows and heavy bulls in good condition attracting solid buyer competition.  All of the major processors were in attendance and operating, supported by a feeder buyer for live export.  Cattle were drawn from Georgetown, Forsayth, Hughenden, Ingham, and Bowen, along with local and coastal areas.  

A small number of vealer steers attracted strong demand from restockers, resulting in dearer trend, reaching 306c/kg, and at 278c/kg.  Yearling steers were of mixed quality and sold to 276c, with several restockers and one feeder buyer for live export competing strongly throughout. Vealer heifers were few in number and sold to higher rates, topping at 260c/kg.  Yearling heifers sold to 256c/kg for the small number on offer.

Heavy bullocks were in short supply and very mixed in quality, selling to 258c/kg.  3 score cows were in good supply and assisted by strong competition, values increased to top at 212c, and average 199c/kg.  Medium weight 2 score cows sold to 197c, averaging 169c/kg.  Medium weight heifers were in good supply and sold strongly to a top of 225c/kg. A larger offering of heavy bulls sold to increased rates, topping at 213c for heavy slaughter lines and 265c/kg for lighter live export types. Some good large lines of cows and calves sold strongly, selling from $900, to a sale top of $1090/unit."
"A similar yarding to last sale of 1,440 cattle were yarded by Charters Towers Combined Agents, with a very good yarding of prime cows and bullocks, predominantly from northern areas, supported by some very good quality lines of store heifers and steers. All major processors were in attendance and active throughout the sale, along with a southern processor and feeder, while restockers continued recent buying activity on all categories throughout the sale.

Increased numbers of vealer heifers sold strongly for better, well grown types, topping at 282.2c/kg. Yearling heifers were mixed in quality and buyers were selective on the offering, with the heavier more covered types selling to a top of 232.2c/kg. Vealer steers were similar in number to last sale, with better grown, good conditioned lines attracting very strong restocker activity, selling to 328.2c/kg. Yearling steers to restockers sold to 282.2c, averaging 274.2c/kg.

An increased number of very good prime bullocks, dominated by a very good northern draft topped at 268.2c to average 252.2c/kg. 2 score bullocks sold to 242.2c/kg, with several restockers competing for the better grown types. Another very good yarding of prime cows saw values increase by up to 10c, with heavy 3 score cows topping at 225.2c to average 218.3c, while 2 score cows sold to 214c to average 196.4c/kg. Restockers were very active on lighter 2 score store cows and one line of PTIC cows, which sold for 210.2c/kg. Well finished 3 score trade heifers sold to 245.2c, while heifers to restockers for breeding sold to 249.2c/kg. Heavy slaughter bulls again sold to increased rates, topping at 229.2c for the heavier types, while lighter young bulls destined for live export sold to 250.2c/kg. Light bull calves sold to 326.2c/kg. A limited number of cows and calves were on offer, selling from $800 to $970, with one outstanding line of big framed cow/calf units selling for $1,475/unit."
"A similar sized yarding was offered with quality to the same level as last week. A wide field of buyers operated with consistent export competition, coupled with local butchers, restockers and independent buyers aiding prices. Consistent cold weather and significant frost have really knocked feedstocks in the local region and many suspect producers to off load cattle in the coming weeks. 

Grown steer quality was similar to the previous sale and prices for medium weights averaged 151.1c, while heavier steers ranged from 151.2c to 164.2c, with both categories improving slightly.
 
The quality of the cow yarding was similar to the previous market, but the tail end of poorer quality cows did appear to be larger than last week. Restockers were very strong purchasing around 100 head of the poorer cows at an average of 99c/kg. Lightweight D3 cows ranged from 125.2c to 135.2 and the large number of heavyweights improved slightly to average 135.1c/kg."
"A similar sized yarding was offered to a regular field of local and export buyers. Despite the supply area slowly drying off there is still a good body of feed available. The overall quality of the yarding was improved on previous weeks, but it did include some plainer types, as is expected at this time of year. The better types continue to sell to very solid demand. 

The light steer numbers improved along with values after selling to a top of 146.2c/kg. The medium weight steers reached 162.2c as heavy weights topped at 170.2c/kg. The limited number of heavy bullocks sold to 171.2c/kg in pen lots. 

The light D3 heifers were in large numbers, selling to 143.2c/kg. The light cow numbers increased dramatically and this had a negative effect on values. The medium weight sold to 136.2c, as the heavy weights averaged 132.1c/kg.  

Most of the bulls offered were heavy weights, which sold to 133.2c/kg."
"A similar sized yarding of mainly local cattle was penned. A full panel of buyers was in operation, however values eased for most categories. Quality in most instances was fair to good as the local area remains particularly dry. 

Light steers averaged 136.2c/kg as most were showing signs of the season. Good medium weights sold to 171.2c to average 167.3c/kg. A large number of heavy steers averaged 168.9c/kg. A small number of light export heifers held firm as the majority eased 8c/kg. 

Cows dominated the yarding with most in the lightweight range as values overall slipped up to 6c/kg. Light D2s averaged 118.7c as others sold to 134.2c/kg. Better medium weights reached 155.2c as D3s averaged 138.4c/kg. Both medium and heavy D4s topped at 148.2c/kg. Most of the bulls offered were in the lightweight range as heavy weights sold to 132.2c/kg."
"A similar sized yarding of export cattle was offered at Charters Towers Wednesday. Values remained firm with gains of up to and over 10c/kg being recorded. 

A large proportion of the steers weighed between 400 and 500kg as the D3s sold to a top of 136.2c/kg. But heavy D3 bullocks selling up to 140.8c/kg outsold these. 

The cows received the biggest gains for the day as light types improved over 20c as a line of twenty-four D2s sold for 95.6c/kg. Medium weight D3 cows also witnessed a healthy rise to average 110.5c with the top of heavy D4s selling to 119.2c/kg. 

Bulls did not miss out on the improved rates with rises of up to 14c being recorded. Large numbers of heavy D1s reached 122.2c/kg."
"A similar sized yarding at Charters Towers saw values ease for most, except for the larger yarding of bulls. Also able to realise a rise were the D4 steers weighing between 500 and 600kg.

The light steers and heavy bullocks were in small numbers making an accurate quote difficult. The medium weight C4s suffered an 11c loss to average 133.2c with the top price for the sale being a medium weight D4 reaching 145.2c/kg. As mentioned before, D4 steers weighing between 500 and 600kg-increased 1c to average 134.4c/kg, even though increased numbers were offered this week. 

Heifers were not as fortunate as last sale, with losses occurring for both the D2s and D3s. Cows also suffered losses with medium weight D3s slipping 7c to average 94.2c after reaching 107.2c/kg and topping the cow section.

All bulls offered were D1s, as light weights increased 8c to average 94c and the heavy weights increased over 20c to average 102.8c/kg."
"A similar number of cattle were offered with a large supply of good quality cows accounting for over a third of the yarding.  Steers were also in fair numbers. All buyers were in attendance, although competition was not as keen in some instances. The bulk of the steers held firm while the heifers improved 4c to 7c/kg. Cows eased by 2c to 6c/kg. 

Light steers sold to 128.2c while the D3 medium weights topped at 149.2c to average 139.7c/kg. Heavy steers peaked at 149.2c also and they averaged 144.6c/kg. One heavy bullock made to 153.2c/kg. Heifers sold to an isolated 125c though most averaged 117.6c/kg. 

Light cows were in good numbers and they sold to 109.2c while a large number of D1s averaged 94.5c/kg. There was close to 400 medium weights penned and they reached 127.2c with close to 300 D3s averaging 119c/kg. Heavy bulls peaked at 107.2c/kg."
"A significantly reduced offering was drawn from the usual supply area and included some plainer quality cattle. With rain threatening in the district it appears producers were keen to retain stock or simply that the region is beginning to run out marketable cattle. The limited supply forced a dearer trend from all the usual buyers plus an extra export operator. 

Lightweight grown steers held firm to range from 103.2c to 145.2c with plainer types averaging 100c/kg. The limited amount of well finished medium weights reached 185c with most sales at 174.7c/kg. Heifers improved to range from 150c to 177.2c/kg. 

Cow demand eased for light cows to average 150.3c with plainer pens averaging 132c/kg. Medium weight D3s ranged from 157.2c to 163.2c with occasional sales reaching 163.2c/kg. Bull competition was mixed for the limited number on offer with some lightweight sales reaching 190.2c/kg."
"A significant reduction in the amount of prime cattle penned saw reduced yarding of 2,610 cattle in Charters Towers this week, 1,040 fewer than last sale.  Quality was very mixed, consisting of many small lines, however some very good pens of cows and steers were presented. All regular processors were in attendance an operating at reduced rates, supported by two live exporters, central and southern feeders, backgrounders and western restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Hughenden, Georgetown, Mt Surprise, Greenvale, Ingham, Prosperpine, local and coastal areas.

The heifer calves to processors sold to 406c to average 383c/kg. Vealer steers to southern restockers topped at 446c/kg. Vealer heifers reached 376c to average from 342c to 355c whilst processor lines averaged from 356c to 385c/kg. Several small lines of light yearling steers to feed sold to 386c as heavy steers reached a top of 388c/kg. Mixed lines of yearling heifers sold according to quality with best quality types to feed selling to 358c/kg. 

Grown steers to live export sold to 366c, most selling from 346c to 354c, with small numbers of steers to the trade reaching 354c/kg. Limited numbers of heifers to the trade sold to 344c/kg. A small number of full mouth bullocks sold to slaughter for a top of 350c/kg. 

Reduced numbers of cows to processors sold to lower rates, with medium weight 2 score cows selling to 280c, while 3 scores topped at 286c multiple times to average from 275c to 281c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export topped at 344c to average 329c/kg. A large sample of young males returning to grass sold to 422c/kg. Some very good cows and calves sold from $1,825 to $1,900/unit."
"A significant increase in the supply of cattle by 1,813 head, saw 3,102 head presented in Charters Towers this week, comprising of several heavier lines of prime cows and a large line of store steers and heifers. Most regular processors operated at subdued rates compared to recent weeks, supported by one live exporter, central feeders and restockers along with regular local backgrounders. Cattle were drawn from Croydon, Richmond, Greenvale, Bowen, Belyando, local and coastal areas. 

Good quality young vealer steers to restockers eased slightly, with plainer types more than 15c/kg easier and plain vealer heifers easing by similar values despite an increase in the number of buyers. Mixed quality yearling steers and heifers sold according to quality, with large samples more than 30c/kg easier. Increased numbers of yearling heifers to the trade sold firm to 5c/kg dearer. A small offering of grown steers sold according to quality, while a large increase in the supply of grown heifers to processors sold to stronger rates throughout. Bullocks eased with quality a factor while heavy cows eased more than 30c/kg on most categories from recent subdued processor values. Increased numbers of medium weight cows sold firm to slightly dearer. Heavy bulls to live export and processor eased by up to 25c/kg.

Good quality vealer steers to restockers topped at 378c, with most sales from 325c to 350c/kg. Very good quality vealer heifers returning to grass sold from 298c to 306c, with a large sample of plainer types to feed averaging 261c/kg.

Heavy grown heifers to processors made to 294c, averaging from 241c to 286c/kg. 

Small numbers of heavy bullocks to export processor sold to 311c to average near 289c/kg. Medium weight cows sold to 212c to average 189c, with heavy 3 score cows reaching 244c to average 242c, with lesser yielding heavy cows averaging 228c and extra heavy cows reaching 252c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export made to 330c, with a select group returning to the paddock as sires made 348c/kg. A small number of cows and calves made $700 with individual sales to $1050/unit."
"A significant increase in supply of cattle this week with 4,285 head yarded, 2,303 more than last sale. Overall quality improved on recent weeks with some very good lines of heavy prime cows and bullocks, along with increased numbers of plainer conditioned cows. Demand was strong throughout for most lines with a new saleyard record for steer and heifer calves. One regular processor was absent, however they were replaced by another major processor for their first attendance of the year. Regular southern processor and feeder orders continued, along with one live exporter and several opportunity driven southern and central restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Richmond, Einasleigh, Mt Garnet, Greenvale, Ingham, Pentland, Woodstock, local and coastal areas.

Increased numbers of calves met a very strong demand for most lines, with a line of steer calves setting a saleyard record of 470.2c, to southern restocker and the heifer portion of the draft made 378.2c/kg. The better bred mixed sex calves averaged from 350c to 392c/kg. Vealer steers to restockers sold to 418.2c multiple times to average from 382c to 400c/kg. Vealer heifers to processors were highly sought after, making to 366.2c to average from 337 to 354c/kg. Restockers paid to 338.2c for light weight pens, and light heifers to feed topped at 324.2c to average 306c/kg.  

Yearling steers to feed sold to 350.2c to average 334c and suitable backgrounder lines sold to 358.2c to average 352c/kg. A small number to live export averaged 330c/kg. Variable quality and weight of the yearling heifers met mixed demand, most selling to feeder orders, reaching 330.2c to average from 256c to 313c/kg. A good draft of grown steers to live export sold to 338.2c to average 331c and heavy feeder steers sold for 334c to average from 320 to 326c/kg.

"A return to a combined prime and store sale attracted 2,571 cattle, very similar to the comparable sale a fortnight ago. Quality was very mixed with a large offering of northern pastoral cows and bulls and many lines showing effects of the lengthening dry season; however, some very good quality lines of bullocks and cows were on offer. The regular buyer panel was in attendance and operated at stronger rates to last sale. Grown steers and heifers lifted by 10c to 15c, bullocks increased 4c, while heavy cows and bulls to processors average 10c to 12c/kg higher.

"A reduced yarding was offered to all the usual export and local buyers. Quality was poor across most of the yarding with only the occasional offering showing some condition. Despite this, market trends were dearer form all categories as the major export buyers competed for the limited stock available. 

Medium grown steers averaged between 201.2c and 205.5c for the better conditioned types while plainer lines averaged 173.2c/kg. Grown heifers sold at dearer levels to average between 143c and 173.4c/kg. 

Cow quality was plainer than last sale but all suitable grades sold to dearer levels. Well conditioned light cows averaged 176.2c while the plainer lines sold to 169.2c to average 157.3c/kg. Medium weights were well represented and averaged between 174.2c and 181.8c/kg thanks to some solid processor competition. Bulls sold at dearer levels with heavy weights reaching 178.2c/kg."
"A reduced yarding was offered to all the regular buyers. As with other markets, competition was strong particularly on the better grown steers and cows. 

Light steers were in limited numbers as medium weights suited to the Korean market topped at 155.2c and others averaged 144c/kg.

"A reduced yarding of 3313 cattle were penned, 826 fewer than last sale.  Quality was very mixed – particularly in the prime section – with fewer heavy bullocks and steers and a wide variation in the quality if the 1,300 cows penned.  Some very good quality lines of young steers and heifers were presented in the store section.  Demand was subdued with one regular export processor continuing their absence in the market, another did not operate, with the remainder participating at reduced rates in line with recent grid adjustments.  One live exporter was active on suitable lines along with a southern feeder and local opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Normanton, Croydon, Georgetown, Einasleigh, Mt Garnet, Greenvale, local and coastal areas.

"A reduced yarding of 1,655 cattle was drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents, following a week's break due to insufficient numbers. The yarding was of very good quality despite coming to the close of the selling season. The yarding included some well finished cows and grown steers, supported by some very good lines of store cattle, albeit in many small lines which lifted by 2c to 8c/kg. One regular processor continued their recent absence, while one another did not operate. Recent hot weather did not deter the remainder of the buying gallery, with a live exporter, feeder buyer and several western restockers displaying very strong and spirited bidding for suitable cattle throughout the sale. Cattle were drawn from Einasleigh, Richmond, Hughenden, Greenvale, Ingham, Woodstock, local and coastal areas.

Some very good quality vealer steers sold very strongly to 442c, with most selling between 385c and 395c/kg. Yearling steers also were of very good quality and sold accordingly to a top of 317c to feed, while those returning to the paddock made to 330c, and a live exporter was very dominant on the suitable weight cattle throughout this segment of the sale, securing lines to 318c/kg. Vealer heifers were readily sought after and many restockers and backgrounders jostled for the available lines selling to 390c, with most sales around 360c/kg. Yearling heifers were of variable quality and weight with heifers to feed selling to 290c, averaging 259c, while those returning to paddock were generally lighter and sold to 312c/kg. 

Bullocks and grown steers increased in number and despite less processor interest, a live exporter assisted in increasing price for suitable types, with bullocks to slaughter selling to 278c, while those to live export sold to 279c/kg. Grown steers to feed sold to 294c, while those to live export reached 319c/kg. Heavy cows were sporadic but the better finished types were of very good weight, averaging 221c and selling to 240c/kg for heavy 3 score cows. 2 score cows sold to 234c, averaging 217c/kg. Restockers were active for lighter one and two score cows, with many sales around 20c, selling to 232c/kg. Bulls were of mixed quality and weight, with a live exporter very dominant on all descriptions. Heavy bulls to slaughter sold to 206c, while similar lines to live export sold to 234c/kg. Medium weight bulls destined for live export sold to 340c/kg. Young males returning to paddock sold to 402c/kg. One good line of young cows and calves sold to $1,220/unit."
"A reduced yarding of 1,424 mixed quality cattle was drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, a reduction of 566 on last sale. Fewer numbers of well finished prime cattle were on offer, with many lines displaying considerable variation in weight and condition. Store cattle comprised of many small lines, with a large variation in quality attracting subdued demand. Only three regular processors were in attendance and operating at similar rates to last sale, while one local feeder buyer and some regular backgrounders and restockers rounded out a small gallery of buyers. Cattle were drawn from Croydon, Georgetown, Cloncurry, Richmond, Torrens Creek, Ingham, Belyando, local and coastal areas.

The absence of vealer steers and the very mixed quality of yearling steers attracted minimal interest with values easing accordingly. Heavy yearling steers to background destined for live export sold to 236c, with many easing by up to 20c/kg with quality a factor. A mixed offering of vealer heifers returning to grass sold to 208c multiple times, with most lesser quality lines selling from 120c to 156c/kg. Yearling heifers comprised of many small lines and one very good quality line of feeder weight heifers. Better types to backgrounders sod to 196c, while heavy yearling heifers to slaughter sold to 225c/kg.

Bullocks were generally lighter and plainer in condition than recent weeks.  Heavy 3 score bullocks to export slaughter sold to 247c, and averaged 3c lower at 246c/kg. Medium weight 3 score bullocks to processors sold to 249c to average 228c, with plainer types to feed selling to 196c to average 166c/kg.

"A reduced yarding of 1,130 mostly prime cattle were penned in Charters Towers, 1,480 fewer than last sale, due to the store sale on Friday. The buyer panel was much reduced, with several restockers, feeders and processors absent, reducing overall demand. Quality was very mixed, with many small lines showing the effects of the lengthening dry season. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Richmond, Greenvale, Ayr, local and coastal areas.

The three major processors were all in attendance and operating with the market firm to slightly cheaper than the last sale.  Cattle were drawn from Einasleigh, Hughenden, Malanda, Belyando, local and coastal areas. The overnight reduction in live export values saw reduced rates for all suitable lines, despite active restocker competition.

"A reduced offering was drawn from the usual supply area including northern and coastal regions. Overall quality was plainer than last sale, as is the case across much of the state this week. Prices reflected the quality by easing for most grades. The exceptions were limited pens of well finished stock that sold to good returns under strong competition from all the usual buyers. 

Lightweight grown steers slipped to range from 147.2c to 163.2c with plainer types averaging 133.7c/kg. The limited amount of well finished medium weights reached 193.2c with most sales at 169.8c/kg. Heifers eased to range from 129.2c to 143.2c/kg.

"A prime only sale attracted 1328 cattle with 4,700 cattle booked for a store sale on Friday. More than half of the yarding comprised of cows, which were of lesser quality and condition than previous weeks. Quality of bullocks and heifers and bulls were mostly good. All regular processors were in attendance, but operating selectively, supported by one live exporter and regular, feeders, backgrounders and restockers. Buyer demand was lacklustre on some lines, with quality a factor. Values for bullocks and steers to processors lifted by up to 30c, heifers improved 8c to 15c, while cows to processors eased by 11c to 15c/kg.

A good supply of cows continued with some good lines of heavy western cows along with some average quality northern cows and increased numbers of heavy bulls. Two regular processors were in attendance and operating along with one southern processor with demand very subdued on most pens. One major feeder buyer was absent, replaced by two opportunity feeders, with minimal restocker activity. Cattle were drawn from Burketown to Mt Isa, east to Georgetown and south to Belyando and the local area.

"A postponed Combined Prime & Store Sale due to wet weather attracted 2198 cattle 320 more than last Wednesday’s regular sale. Significant rain across much of the north restricted numbers, however producers have found significant enthusiasm with the change of season. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Normanton, Georgetown, Mt Garnet, local and coastal areas. Quality was mixed with 680 prime cattle dominated by good conditioned cows, while store cattle were of very good quality consisting of two large northern lines.

Buyer attendance was not as good as previous weeks with one processor in attendance but not operating however, competition was strong for the better quality lines of young steers and heifers from southern and central restockers. Young steers lifted 50c, yearling heifers improved 25c and heavy cows to processors increased by 35c/kg.

"A much smaller yarding sold to most of the usual buyers. Quality was fair and values were mostly dearer than last weeks rates. The majority of the yarding was females and there was only a handful of steers and bulls penned. 

Most of the medium weight steers sold 5c dearer and averaged 145.1c after they reached 152.2c/kg.  Heavy steers were slightly dearer after they topped at 154.2c/kg.

There were a large number of heifers considering the size of the yarding and they reached 135.2c to average 13c dearer at 127.7c/kg. Light weight cows were dearer and averaged 110.3c while the most were medium weights that sold 2c dearer to average 123c/kg. Heavy cows reached 134.2c to average just below 130c/kg. 

A small number of bulls topped at 120c/kg."
"A much smaller yarding sold to a regular field of buyers, although not all were active. Numbers eased following storms in the area, as it appears producers are holding onto some stock. Steers received mixed results, while values eased dramatically in the cow and bull market, although quality was a major factor.

Steers were of poorer quality and were mainly light and medium weights. Lightweight D2s were 2c dearer averaging 170.5c after topping at 185.2c/kg. Medium weight D2s were slight cheaper reaching 190.2c, while D3s sold to 206.2 with most around the 191c/kg mark. Heavy weight steers sold to 211.2c and averaged 207.8c/kg.

A limited number of heifers realised losses from 7c to 21c and D3s averaged 169c/kg. The cow market that was predominantly lightweights eased by 16c to 38c/kg. The D2 lightweights averaged 133.3c after reaching 149.2c/kg. The better quality cows sold on firm rates which saw medium weight D3s average 189.6c after selling to 202.4c/kg.

Bulls also lost value, light weights were 27c cheaper averaging 127c/kg. The medium weights were back by 26c averaging 143.1c with top sales reaching 174.2c/kg. Heavyweights were slightly dearer selling to 200.2c/kg."
"A much smaller poorer quality yarding sold to reduced competition with only a limited number of processors operating and most purchases were made by a handful of works. Storm activity has not assisted stock as yet and the majority of the yarding were in 2 score condition. 

There were a small number of steers available and Korean weight D3s were the only grade with sufficient numbers to quote. Values were back for these and after topping at 175.2c averaged 170.4c/kg.

The female component of the sale saw some values increase. Light D2 heifers were 6c dearer averaging 140.2c/kg. Cows were in the greatest supply and the lighter and D2 descriptions sold on a dearer trend. Close to 100 Light D2s averaged 135.9c and reached 146.2c/kg. Medium weight D3s lost ground and averaged 148.4c after selling to a top of 150.2c/kg. 

A limited number of bulls saw lightweights cheaper and after reaching a top price of 121.2c averaged 113.9c/kg."
"A much reduced yarding off 633 mixed quality cattle were drawn at Charters Towers this week, with strong competition from restockers throughout the sale as a result of recent isolated storms across the north. Processors were all in attendance, however were selective on cattle suitable for slaughter. Cattle were drawn from Hughenden, Einasleigh, Ingham, Ayr, Woodstock and local and coastal areas. 

Vealer heifers were keenly sought by restockers selling to 286.2c/kg, with a lift in values throughout the offering. A limited number of vealer steers sold to stronger rates on the previous sale, with restockers again active on all lines, topping at 300.2c/kg. Light calves sold to 298.2c/kg. 
 
The limited number of 3 score bullocks sold to 287.2c/kg. A small number of 3 score cows sold strongly to 267.2 c/kg and 2 score cows to 245.2c/kg. Bulls were variable in condition and sold to 268.2c/kg for lighter weights, with heavier bulls selling to 239.2c/kg. 

Very few cow and calves were presented and sold they to $1060/unit."
"A much larger yarding was offered to the regular field of buyers. The large numbers saw cows in the majority and some reports suggested that the influx was driven by the cheaper markets earlier in the week. Quality was of the same standard as the previous sale and the lesser market rate was mainly associated with increased supply and overall state trend. Further rain would be welcomed to ensure sufficient amounts have been received for the upcoming dry season. 

Light steers lost substantial ground and averaged 127.5c after they reached 140c/kg. Close to 100 medium weights made to 170.2c and averaged 7c cheaper at 160.8c/kg. Heavy steers followed a similar trend and reached 172.2c to average 168.4c/kg. 

Grown heifers faired the best in the cheaper market realising a 6c loss to average 153.5c/kg. There was over 200 light C2 cows that lost 21c and averaged 109.5c/kg. The very poorer quality stock averaged 98.5c while the better types saw most sales around 125.2c/kg. Medium weights were in similar numbers and lost the most ground, which saw 155 D3s averaged 128.8c after they reached 138.2c/kg.

The bull market continued the cheaper trend and most averaged around 120c/kg."
"A much larger yarding sold to strong and healthy competition. Rain fell throughout the sale and some areas in the district have received up to 350mm. All the regular meat works purchased stock and values increased from 9c to 14c/kg. The steer market saw a greater number of good quality descriptions available while it appeared that there was a more even line up of cows available. 

Medium weight steers sold 11c dearer and over 100 head averaged 154.3c after they reached 166.2c/kg. Heavy weights averaged 13c dearer at 159c and they also topped at 166.2c/kg. Bullocks sold to 174.2c/kg to return up to $1,184/head. 

Heifers sold on a mainly dearer trend and averages were around 142c to 143c/kg. The cow market realised gains of up to 9c/kg. Light cows faired the best and averaged 115.2c after reaching close to 140c/kg. Medium weights sold 3c dearer and averaged close to 124c after they topped at 134.2c/kg. 

Bulls realised mixed results and heavy weights average 135c/kg."
"A much larger yarding of export cattle was offered at Charters Towers with values remaining firm to dearer for most descriptions. 

In the light weight steers, D3s sold from 140.2c to 141.2c/kg. The heavier steers above 500kg managed to average above 150c, the only grade that was not able to do this were the D3s, which still sold to 149.5c/kg. 

With only light heifers available, a rise of 11c was recorded for the D3s and D4s to average 132.9c and 144.5c/kg respectively. The light weight D3 cows saw a loss of 9c to average 116.4c/kg with all other grades remaining firm. One heavy D4 cow sold to 158.2c to return over $900/head.

The medium weight bulls saw substantial rises of more than 10c to average 136.3c after reaching a top of 155.2c/kg."
"A much larger yarding of 1,597 cattle was drawn by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, an increase of 1,057 head, featuring a very good line of full mouthed heavy bullocks, supported by several good lines of cows and heavy grown heifers, along with some high quality northern bred weaner steers. All regular processors were in attendance and operating at more enthusiastic rates than previous week's, supported by one local feeder buyer, one live exporter and some opportunity restockers throughout the sale. Cattle were drawn from Burketown, Richmond, Hughenden, Guru, local and coastal areas.

Increased numbers of vealer steers were generally suitably weaned types of very good quality, selling to increased rates, with a large sample of heavier vealers lifting by 10c, making to 280c to average 272c, with lighter types to 300c to average 279c/kg. Yearling steers were of mixed quality and the variation of the smaller lines was not a good indicator of the market. Medium weight steers to restockers sold to 258c averaging 250c, while medium weights to feed sold to 234c for better types and light yearling steers returning to grass sold to 269c to average 256/kg. Only a small number of vealer heifers were on offer, with no solid trends for the mixed quality lines. Suitably weaned heifers calves sold for 216c, with some very good quality crossbred vealer heifers returning to the paddock selling to 220c/kg. Yearling heifers consisted of many individual sales from 170c to 180c, topping at 188c/kg.

A large line of good quality full mouthed heavy bullocks, was the highlight of the sale, with those above 540kg easing 3c to average 247c, topping at 254c, while those above 470kg sold to 249c to average 244c/kg. Grown steers were very mixed with heavy steers to feed selling to 237c to average 231c, with 3 score types to feed selling to 240c/kg. A few grown steers to slaughter made to 243c/kg.

A small number of light cows to restockers sold to 127c/kg. Larger numbers of grown heifers were generally well finished and the improved weights saw improved demand topping at 230c to average 210c/kg. Heavy bulls continued recent strong demand led by live exporters, with heavy bulls making 272c, with similar bulls to feed destined for live export selling to 279c, to average 260c/kg.

"A mixed yarding of 1,385 cattle, 222 fewer than previous sale for Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, dominated by a large number of plainer cattle showing the effects of the season and some good lines of young cattle meeting very strong demand. One regular processor and feeder buyer were absent this week with all others operating on lower prices than previous weeks, while one live exporter and a local feeder buyer along with restockers provided very strong demand throughout the store section. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Normanton, Croydon, Richmond, Pentland, Tully, Ingham, Townsville, local and coastal areas.

A similar number of vealer steers sold firm on last sale with some very good quality small lines reaching 340c to average 324c/kg. One line of heavier vealer steer to restockers sold for 312c/kg. Yearling steers were more variable in quality and weight with prices increasing by 2c to 16c, driven by live export demand with light feeder steers making 286c and heavy feeder steers 299c/kg. Light yearling steers to restockers sold to 310c, to average 305, while heavier steers 330-400kg also reached 310c, averaging 287c and heavy backgrounder steers sold to 269c/kg.

"A mixed quality yarding of 948 cattle were presented in Charters Towers, 990 head fewer than last week. Several good lines of heavy prime cows were penned along with some small lines of very good quality young steers. The regular processors and one live exporter operated at improved rates for better quality lines, along with opportunity local restockers and backgrounders, however no regular feeder buyers were in attendance. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Julia Ck, Prairie, Bowen, Collinsville, local and coastal areas.  

Young steer calves increased by more than 20c and a large sample of vealer steers improved by 4c/kg.

Young steer calves sold to 304c to average 265c, with heifer calves made a top of 224c/kg for a small sample. Vealer steers sold to 296c to average 274c, with vealer heifers selling to 211c/kg to average the same. A small number of yearling heifers above 330kg returning to grass made 234c/kg.

Consignments came from Mt Garnet, Greenvale, Tully, Home hill, along with local and coastal areas. All meatworks buyers were present and active for suitable lines, with restockers, backgrounders and a central feeder buyer active throughout the sale. A very good line of prime cows met strong demand from processors, and were supported by a number of small pens in good condition despite the light season being experienced in the region.  Limited store lines were on offer, with values easing compared to last sale.    

Yearling steers were of mixed quality, with a number of small lines penned, selling to 336c/kg.  Vealer steers topped at 352c/kg for a limited offering to restockers and feeder buyers.  Yearling heifers sold to strong competition to restockers for a top of 336c/kg.

One regular processor was absent again this week, however the processors in attendance were all operating including one live exporter and two regular feeder buyers. Cattle were drawn from Doomadgee, Burketown, Mt Isa, Richmond, Croydon, Einasleigh, Mt Garnet, Ingham, Woodstock, local and coastal areas.

An increase in the number of vealer heifers saw increased values for better quality and conditioned types, with one outstanding line of heifers selling to restockers a top of 382.2c/kg. Yearling heifers were variable in quality and sold strongly to both restockers and feeder buyers, with heifers to restockers selling to 282.2c, while heifers to feed sold to 334.2c/kg. Vealer steers were of very mixed quality, however restockers were particularly competitive on lighter types with a new saleyard record of 440.2c for light weight vealer steers, which averaged 415.8.2c/kg. Yearling steers were dominated by light weight northern consignments which sold to a top of 412.2c to restockers and averaged 360.4c, while yearling steers to feed topped at 341.2c/kg.

Some large lines of grown heifers attracted strong feeder interest and sold to 340.2 to average 311.7c/kg. Several pens of heavy unfinished bullocks were on offer, with the best heavy 3 score bullocks to slaughter selling to 301.2c, while heavy grown steers to feed sold to 345.2c to average 319.1c/kg.

A continued good offering of cows and calves sold to a top of $1,800 for some very good quality pens, with most selling from $1,220 to $1,420/unit."
"A larger yarding was penned at Charters Towers with values for almost all types improving under very good buyer support. The quality of the yarding was described as mixed as the quality of the bullocks below last weeks standard yet the penning of cows was of improved quality. 

The only description to suffer a loss was the small number of light steers. The 500 to 600kg bullocks improved over 10c to average 158.6c as the heavy bullocks reach a top of 163.2c/kg.

In large numbers, were the light D4 heifers, which sold to 144.5c and averaged 138.3c/kg. The improved line up of cows was met with very good demand with most improving over 7c/kg. As has been the case at other centres, the top of the cows was a heavy D4, which sold to 139.2c/kg. 

All weights of bulls were D1s with the top being heavy types reaching 140c/kg and returning $1,141/head."
"A larger yarding was offered to a full panel of buyers. Quality was mixed, however most were plainer lines showing the signs of the current poor season.  Steers and cows dominated the yarding with no trade weights in the prime section of the sale. 

Light steers were in limited numbers as the better medium weights suited to the Korean market sold to 145c as a large line of plainer D2s averaged 130.1c/kg. Good heavy steers topped at 156.2c to average 146.3c/kg. Light export heifers were mainly plainer lines averaging around 113c/kg. 

The large numbers of cows sold to an improved market and this has been a similar trend at southern sales. Light D2s averaged 94.5c as medium weights sold to 115.2c/kg. The D3 medium weights average 112.9c/kg."
"A larger yarding was offered to a full field of buyers. The trend of dearer prices has continued with only the plainest cows selling to a cheaper market. The yarding was dominated by steers and cows with only a small number of bulls yarded. 

Most of the light steers were showing the signs of the ongoing dry season to average around 114c/kg. There were some good medium weights included in the yarding and these averaged 145.6c as heavy weights sold to 155c/kg. A large number of medium weight D2s averaged 132.4c/kg. Most of the light export heifers averaged 91.2c with others selling to 117.2c/kg. 

Light D2 cows reached 109.2c as a pen of D3s sold for 119.2c/kg. The large supply of medium weight D3s improved 5c after selling to 122.2c to average 117.6c/kg. The top of the cows reached 126.2c/kg."
"A larger yarding was offered and values followed a similar trend to previous weeks to be cheaper again for most grades. All the regular buyers were in attendance with the yarding predominately females. As has been the case, quality was once again mixed. 

Only a handful of light steers were penned as medium weights reached 150.2c/kg. A large number of heavy steers were offered averaging 140.1c after topping at 151.2c/kg. The leaner light export heifers sold to a cheaper market, while the D3s managed to improve 9c topping at 120c/kg. 

Almost all the cows were light and medium weights selling to a cheaper market as a small pen of heavy weights sold for 105c/kg. Light cows made to 85.2c as medium weights reached 99.2c/kg."
"A larger yarding sold to the regular field of buyers who were all active. The mixed quality run saw better descriptions sell on a dearer trend while the plainer types continued to loose ground.  Competition was strong for most of the market however later sales were not as highly sought after. 

The large supply of light steers lost 14c and averaged 116.7c/kg although the cheaper trend can be attributed to the drop in quality. The better quality medium weights received gains and averaged 145.8c after they sold to a top of 151.2c/kg. Heavy weights experienced the greatest gains following the poor quality offerings of previous weeks and averaged 150.9c after the reached 154.2c/kg. 

Grown heifers mainly sold on a cheaper trend and a fair sample averaged 115c/kg.  The very light and poor quality cows received fair results and averaged 95.3c/kg. The medium weight cows that dominated the yarding sold firm to 3c cheaper and the D3s averaged 120.5c while the lighter quality descriptions averaged just under 110c/kg.  

The bull market continued to loose ground and the heavier bulls toped at 120c/kg."
"A larger yarding of better quality sold to a larger field of buyers that saw processors purchasing stock along with local butchers. Good lines of steers and cows dominated the sale. There has been some storm activity in the area although sufficient rain for runoff is yet to be received 

The steer penning was dominated by D3 Korean weights that sold to 152.2c to average 143.8c/kg. Heavy weights averaged slightly dearer while the best bullocks sold to 160c/kg to return $1,080/head.

Mainly cows made up the balance of the penning and they sold at slightly cheaper rates. The lightweights topped at 106.3c to average just over 111c/kg. Medium weights topped at 128.2c to average close to 121c/kg. 

The medium and heavy weight bulls averaged from 134.9c to 137.8c/kg."
"A larger yarding of 2,123 head were yarded by Charters Towers Combined Selling Agents this week, primarily due to improvement in weather conditions after the rain affected yarding the previous week. The yarding attracted some very good quality and well finished bullocks and cows, along with some very good small lines of vealer steers and heifers. Most of the regular processors were in attendance and operating with one notable absence, however restockers were active throughout the sale on suitable lines along with regular feeder buyers.

Vealer steers again attracted strong competition, with western restockers very dominant for the limited offering, topping at 383.2c, averaging 371.7c, with most sales above 360c/kg. Yearling steers were in good supply, with some very good quality steers to restockers topping at 350.2c, while light feeder steers made to 329.2c/kg. The small number of grown steers to restockers sold to 294.2c/kg. Vealer heifers were of mixed quality and the fewer number sold strongly to a top of 350.2c/kg.

Heavy 3 score bullocks topped at 290.2c, while restockers paid to 272.2c, while medium weight feeder types sold to 298.2c/kg.

Heavy 3 score cows were again in good supply with values improving 5c to  8c/kg on last sale, with medium weight 2 score cows holding firm on last week. Heavy 3 score cows topped at 258.2c, to average 242.6c, while heavy 2 score cows to slaughter sold to 247.2c, averaging 217.3c/kg. Medium weight 3 score cows sold to 222.2c, with lighter cows to restockers selling to 221.2c, to average 209.1c/kg. A good offering of heavy heifers to slaughter sold to 267.2c, with feeders were also active on suitable lines, topping at 300.2c/kg. A good selection of heavy 3 score bulls sold to 263.2c multiple times, while restockers paid to 264.2c/kg for breeding. Medium weight bulls to feed destined for live export, sold to 312.2c/kg. Light weight males to restockers sold to 389.2c for crossbred types, with many selling for 310c to 344.2c/kg. A good offering of cows and calves sold strongly, topping at $1,410, with most selling from $1,200 to $1,380/unit."
"A larger yarding of 1,085 head was drawn by Charters Towers Combined Agents this week, with an improved quality yarding on the last sale. Cows dominated the prime section, with a large line from the Northern Gulf reflecting the improvement in season conditions in some areas across the yarding. Competition was strong from two of the three regular processors, supported by a southern processor and feeder buyer in conjunction with restockers operating throughout the sale. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Greenvale, Hughenden, Prairie, Belyando, Guru and local areas.

Vealer steers were fewer in numbers, with restockers competing strongly on selected lines selling to top at 378.2c/kg. Yearling steers were mixed in quality and sold to 340.2c/kg for the few on offer. Vealer heifers were in high demand and sold to 310.2c/kg, with solid competition for many lines. Yearling heifers sold to a high of 310.2c/kg for some very good quality pens.  

The small number of bullocks sold to 252.2c/kg. The large number of cows sold to lower reduced rates in line with southern sales earlier in the week. Heavy 3 score cows fell by up to 30c, selling to a top of 218.2c, with many selling for 204c to 210c/kg. 2 score cows were well in demand and lifted in rates by up to 10c, selling to 209.2c, to average 197c/kg. An increased number of heavy bulls for slaughter sold to 232.2c, while bulls to live export sold to 236.2c for heavier bulls and 255.2c/kg for feeder types. A very good quality pen of cows and calves sold to $1,340, with other lines selling from $650 to $990/unit."
"A larger yarding at Charters Towers was met with solid competition as values remained fully firm. With the single calf sale reaching 119.2c/kg, all the other cattle offered were export types. 

The low Australian dollar kept buyers active on all lines of steers with rises of 3c to 4c/kg being recorded. A pen of medium weight C3 steers sold for 161.2c as heavy C3 steers topped at 165.2c/kg. Heavy D1 bullocks weighing over 600kg topped the sale after reaching 174.6c/kg in pen lots. 

The light D1 cows sold to a top of 126.2c with the medium weight D1 cows were in the largest numbers and sold to 166.2c to average 147.5c/kg.  Heavy D3 bulls sold to 154.6c to return the vendor $1,228/head and average 147.6c/kg."
"A larger number was offered to a full panel of buyers. Quality was of a lesser standard than previous weeks and there was only a handful of fair quality steers available. This contributed to values falling once again, however competition was not as strong as processors looked to lower rates. Steers were up to 18c cheaper though the better grades only eased 3c/kg.

"A decreased yarding that saw a large amount of unfinished stocked penned sold to the regular field of buyers along with extra orders that allowed values to continue to increase. The current market environment saw more small lots being offered as producers took advantage of the increased values. Those cattle of better quality demanded the best prices.

Light steers realised a 5c/kg cheaper trend to average 155.6c/kg. Heavy bullocks and steers sold on a trend of 5c to 7c/kg dearer, with the best D3s reaching a top of 206.2c/kg.

The bull market was also dearer with the heavy weights returning up to $1,760/head."
"A decreased yarding on the back of some welcome rain across much of the region resulted in 945 cattle penned. Overall quality was good with one large line of PTIC cows dominating the prime section, supported a smaller offering of very good quality store cattle. One large processor was in attendance but did not operate while two other regular processors were absent. Backgrounder and feeder operators were mildly active along with spirited opportunity restockers.

The small number of light steers mostly sold around 109c/kg. The medium weight steers of top quality were in very small numbers and reached 148.2c/kg. There was close to 270 D2s that averaged 116.9c while 230 D3s averaged 125.4c/kg. The heavy steers topped at 145c and the better grades averaged 143.3c while over 200 D3s averaged 129.2c/kg. Heavy bullocks sold to 142.2c/kg. 

The heifers reached 125.2c and the D3s averaged 115.3c/kg. There were 250 light cows of poor condition that averaged 82.2c/kg. It appears that many had just weaned calves and been sent directly to market. The medium weight cows felt the harshest blows of the week and close to 200 D3s averaged 112.8c after they reached 116.2c/kg. 

Light bulls averaged 85.7c while the heavy bulls reached 125.2c/kg."
" Charters Towers Combined Agents yarded 2568 following no sale last week.  The yarding was dominated by a large single vendor line of lightweight northern weaners, supported by a limited number of prime bullocks and cows. Only  three regular processors were operating along with regular feeders, one live exporter and an increased number of opportunity restockers. Cattle weee drawn from Mt Isa, Croydon,, Georgetown and south to the local area.

Increased restocker competition saw light steers improve 25c to 50c, heavy steers and bullocks to processors improved 15c and prime cows were mostly firm.

Steers under 200 kg returning to the paddock averaged 262c, selling to a top of 276c, steers above 200kg made to 262c to average 245c/kg.  Similar heifers under 200kg returning to the paddock sold to 132c to average 127c/kg. Heifers above 200kg averaged 121c/kg, while those to the trade averaged 123c/kg.  Small mixed quality lines of yearling steers sold according to quality. Steers above 280kg to feed reached 218c to average 171c to 189c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed made to 136c to average 127c, heifers above 330kg sold to 158c to average 126c/kg.  A small sample of grown steers to live export averaged 170c/kg.  A large sample of grown heifers to processors sold to 155c for an improved average of 150c/kg.

Heavy full mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 190c, most sales 164c to 172c, a small sample to live export made 168c/kg. Medium weightlifting 3 score cows sold to 159c to average 140c, prime heavyweight cows topped at 190c to average 164c/kg.  Heavy bulls to live export made to 202c to average 178c/kg, processor bulls averaged from 130c to 180c/kg.

A small number of cows and calves made to $850 per unit.

Market Reporter, Mick Kingham"
" A slightly reduced yarding of cattle was mostly drawn from the Ingham district with local lines in limited supply. All the local buyers and regular export buyers were operating. Quality was not as good as recent weeks with more tail end drafts coming forward. 

Good medium weight grown steers averaged 176.3c after topping at 188.2c/kg. Heavy steers reached 190.2c with the limited number averaging 187.4c/kg. Grown C3 heifers averaged 157.2c, as plainer D2s sold closer to 128c/kg. 

Cows dominated the yarding with most being lightweights. Light D2s averaged 135.8c as the D3s reached 165.2c/kg. Medium weight D3s averaged 158.8c as both medium and heavy cows reached 174.2c/kg. Most of the good bulls were C2 medium and heavy weights, which sold to 162.2c/kg to return over $1,300/head."
" A slightly larger yarding attracted very strong competition from all the regular buyers. The quality was on a par with that of last week with values lifting further for a majority of the cattle. As has been the case at other centers, a fair percentage of the yarding was lighter weights. 

The really good quality steers and bullocks were made up of a large run from near Clermont. Medium weight steers were firm to slightly dearer as those suited to the Korean market averaged 214.5c/kg. All of the heavy steers and bullocks returned over $1,100/head with the better steers averaging close to 232c after selling to 237.2c/kg. 

The light heifers sold to a mixed market with the plainer categories loosing up to 6c/kg. A large number of light cows averaged 157.2c while the D3s reached 195.2c/kg.  Medium weight cows sold to 208.2c as the D3s averaged 187.7c/kg. 

The light bulls made to 168.2c as a heavy weight reached 199.2c/kg."
