Commentary
"Despite good follow up rain over the weekend producers took advantage of the strong markets with numbers increasing slightly. The quality of the offering was fair to good with young cattle suitable to restock and feed well supplied. Not as many cows this week while there were limited supplies of well finished grown cattle. The full compliment of buyers were in attendance with demand high from all sectors.

Restocker confidence was high with the rain all but ensuring a bumper spring. This resulted in the lightweight young cattle selling to dearer trends with the steer portion showing significant improvement. There was a quality component to the strong improvement also. The heifer portion also saw a dearer trend. Medium weight yearling seers to restockers sold to a slightly cheaper trend while the feeder steers improved for quality. Heavy weight feeder steers were keenly sought with the trend as much as 17c/kg dearer. Well finished heavy trade also sold to a dearer trend. More quality related price change on the medium weight yearling heifers to restock and feed with the secondary quality lines heavily discounted. Heavyweights to feed attracted strong competition while those to the trade sold to a slightly cheaper trend.

Too few heavy grown steers to quote. The well finished grown heifers saw the lighter weight class sell to a dearer trend while the heavy weights were cheaper. In the cow market the secondary and medium weights sold to cheaper trends while the better conditioned heavyweights saw a dearer trend of as much as 10c/kg."
