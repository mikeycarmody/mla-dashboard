Commentary
"Numbers jumped this sale with agents yarding 2369 head. Quality was mixed but fair with a handy offering of well bred cattle available. Yearlings made up the majority of the yard along with a good run of cows. The usual buyers were present and competing in an easier market. 

Yearling steers slipped 10c/kg with feeders paring from 330 to 400c/kg for middle and heavyweights. The finished types to processors sold from 335 to 363c/kg, middleweight heifers held fairly steady to sell from 331 to 355c/kg to feed. Heavyweights were back 10 to 14c with processors paying from 321c to 347c/kg. 

Heavy steers and bullocks dropped 10c ranging from 310c to 363c/kg. Grown heifers sold from 305 to 335c/kg. Cows held mostly steady with heavy cows from 285 to 313c with plainer types from 282c to 302c/kg. The best heavy bull reached 337c/kg."
