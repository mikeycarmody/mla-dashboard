Commentary
"Numbers were back and the quality was a little plainer with fewer prime heavy weights cattle. Medium weight feeders were still well supplied and heavy weights back in numbers. Noticeably some heavy feeder orders were not as active this week or not operating at all. Trade buyers also picked through pens with the absence of pen lots. In the grown cattle, there were not the heavy bullocks and grown heifers of previous weeks and there were still good numbers of heavy cows but there were more medium weights penned. Generally light and medium weights feeders and the light end of the trade cattle were firm to 7c softer with heavy weights were softer,.
 
The best of the vealer reached 365c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers averaged firm to 3c stronger selling between 296c and 380c/kg. Restocker paid to 406c/kg for similar weights and this was 15c better than last week. Heavy feeders fell 23c/kg and most sold from 310c to 355c/kg. Feeder heifers slipped 7c on the medium weights with the bulk 260c to 312c and heavy weights were 10c to 12c softer 265c to 320c/kg. Heavy trade steers were 30c cheaper with less competition from feeders with most selling from 320c to 346c/kg.
 
Grown steers and heifers both fell 20c to 25c with prime steers selling from 297c to 370c and heavy bullocks reached 355c/kg. Grown heifers ranged from 272c to 328c/kg to the processors. Heavy cows had falls of 15c to 19c with the heavy weights selling from 265c to 298 and the medium weight 2 score 210c to 238c/kg."
