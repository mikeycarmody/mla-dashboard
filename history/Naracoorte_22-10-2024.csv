Commentary
"Numbers rose at Naracoorte as agents yarded 1,106 head of liveweight and open auction cattle. These sold to the usual field of trade and processor buyers along with feeders and restocker orders. Demand from the buying group was limited with some choosing not to participate in a mixed quality offering with a cheaper market being the end result.
Yearling steers to the trade sold from 255c to 314c with feeders active from 230c to 334c and restockers from 280c to 347c/kg. Yearling heifers returned from 220c to 342c as feeders operated here from 215c to 316c/kg.
Grown steers and bullocks attracted trade buyers from 310c to 340c and the feeders from 288c to also 340c/kg. Grown heifers sold to the trade from 255c to 318c with feeder interest from 262c to 320c as manufacturing cattle reached 270c/kg. 
Heavy cows ranged from 270c to 302c with the lighter lots making from 205c to 284c as bulls sold from 210c to 288c/kg.
