Commentary
"Much smaller yarding following the Easter break and soaking autumn rain of more than 40ml across most of the region. Quality also declined with very few well bred and finished types on offer, the bulk of the numbers being plainer bred and secondary cattle lacking shape and carcass appeal. For such a small offering there was a reasonable number of bulls and unmarked younger steers. A restocking order was back operating and the sale did show a dearer trend compared to the cheaper results of a fortnight ago. The few good beef cows showed a rise of 20c and more. But limited quality did keep a cap on the market.

There was no sales above 300c in this auction, the best price of 298c for a single Charolais heifer followed by 294c for a trade steer. Breed type and quality determined price rate, with the straighter bred British yearlings and calves mostly 230c to 280c/kg, and secondary types from 150c to 220c/kg. There was low points of 20c to 50c for the most secondary animals.

The best quality in the yarding was the lead of the beef cows which were dearer at 205c to a top of 256c/kg. Lighter and dairy-cross types from 130c to 180c/kg. There was no bullocks or heavy steers of note. A small lot of grown Friesian steers with reasonable fat cover made 234c/kg. Dairy steers with less weight and finish mostly 150c to 180c/kg.
