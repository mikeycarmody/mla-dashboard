Commentary
"There was a much larger yarding of 183 trade and grown cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with a big percentage of store cattle included. There were very few good quality trade yearlings with most being unfinished types which were bought by restockers. Yearling steers made 200c to 254c and heifers 170c to 200c/kg.

There was a mixed yarding of 55 cows and the best D3 cows made 140c to 158c, medium 110c to 118c and very lean 40c to 96c/kg liveweight.

Market Reporter Richard Bailey"
