Commentary
"An influx of heavy weight feeder steers and large runs of well finished heavy weight cows accounted for much of the rise in numbers. Young cattle were well supplied while export processors were also well catered for. Overall the quality and condition of the offering was fair to good however there was a smaller percentage of plainer quality and conditioned cattle. The full field of buyers were in attendance along with an extra export processor. 

The outstanding seasonal conditions contributed to the strong demand from restockers for light weight young cattle. This resulted in dearer trends in both the steers and the heifers with the steer portion showing the greater improvement. There was little change in market trends for the medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed with some quality related improvement. Heavy trade steers also experienced little change. Medium and heavyweight yearling heifers to feed and to process sold on firm to slightly dearer trends with an isolated sale to the trade showing a significant rise under strong restocker competition.

Well finished heavy grown steers sold to dearer trends under higher demand and strong competition. The well finished grown heifers were also keenly sought to record a moderate improvement. Despite extra competition the cow market saw trends firm to cheaper with the medium weights showing little change while the large numbers of well finished heavy weights contributed to those classes being cheaper. The bull market followed a similar trend."
