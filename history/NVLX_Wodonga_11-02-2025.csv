Commentary
" 
This week, the market saw a further decline in numbers, with a noticeable drop in the quality. Many of the pens presented were quite plain, featuring a significant amount of clean-up pen lots. Despite the reduction in quality, the sale attracted more buyers; however, some feedlot buyers faced challenges in making purchases, as it proved difficult to buy good quality lines.
 
In the vealer category, the pick of the offerings commanded prices ranging from 295c to 345c/kg. The remainder of the vealers found their way to feedlots and restockers. Trade steers and heifers sold within the range of 290c to 315c/kg, indicating the limited supply. Feeder steers experienced a notable gain of 25c, with prices ranging from 305c to 357c/kg.
 
On the export front, processors showed a keen interest in young steers weighing over 600 kilograms. Bullocks saw a positive shift, gaining 25c and selling between 310 and 385c/kg. Meanwhile, heavy steers eased slightly, dropping by 3c to achieve prices between 320c and 335c/kg. The cow sale presented a mixed yarding, and attracting a larger group of buyers. Heavy cows saw an improvement of 9c, with prices ranging from 272c to 304c/kg. In contrast, leaner cows weighing under 520 kilograms sold for 210 to 270c/kg. Heavy bulls rounded out the market, selling between 267 and 301c/kg."
