Commentary
"There was an increase in supply with an influx of restocker and feeder cattle. The quality and condition of the offering was fair to very good throughout. There were some nice lines of young cattle along with some very good heavy steers and cows. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Varying trends through the young cattle where light weight steers sold to dearer trends under strong restocker competition. Price differential on specific breeds was substantial while quality was also a factor. The medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to cheaper trends with the medium weights least affected. The heavy weights down by 10c to 15c/kg. An overall improvement in quality negating that negative price somewhat. Opposite to the light weight restocker steers the breed related price variation was not as great on the heavy feeders however quality was a factor. Light weight heifers to restockers sold on a firm to dearer trend while the medium and heavy weights saw a slightly dearer trend under increased competition.  Heavy trade yearlings also sold to a cheaper trend.

There were limited numbers of heavy grown steers purchased by processors with the market trend cheaper while those to feed were dearer under greater competition. The well finished heavy grown heifers sold to cheaper trends while the lighter weights averaged a little higher. There were cheaper trends through the cow market with heavy 3 and 4 scores down by as much as 8c/kg. Heavy bulls to process sold to cheaper trends while carrying plenty of condition."
