Commentary
"Prime vealers reaching 460c, and high yielding yearlings to process, topping at 456c/kg, were the highlights of the 773 good to outstanding cattle, a slight increase on last weekâ€™s sale. There were some good runs of feeder steers, along with some well-bred yearling heifers suiting both the feedlot buyers and the restockers. There was an increased number of grown cattle and 90.cows.  There was strong competition from all the usual buyers, along with extra restocker interest, selling to a considerably dearer market.

Yearlings to suit the trade lifted 20c, selling from 280c to 456c/kg. Feeder steers were 25c better, making from 313c to 370c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed up to 20c dearer, averaging 318c, and those returning to the paddock topped at 347c/kg. Weaner steers jumped 60c, selling from 290c to 456c, and the heifer portion were up to 80c better, ranging from 246c to 394c/kg.

Heavy grown steers lifted 10c, making from 310c to 355c, and grown heifers were price unchanged, selling from 284c to 333c/kg. Heavy prime cows were 12c better, topping at 304c/kg. The best heavy weight bull to process made 313c/kg.
