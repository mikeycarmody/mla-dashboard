Commentary
"There were 950 exports of that 370 were cows and 545 trade cattle were penned. First sale back for 2025 saw the market kick, even though not all buyers attended or purchasing, the exporters at the rails were keen to source the well shaped and finished grown stock. 

The trade cattle were a little variable in quality, however this failed to stop the price rises of 10c to 30c/kg, There was a fair to good quality offering of medium to heavy vealers that made from 340c to 388c/kg. The yearling steers to the trade ranged from 333c to 395c/kg, while the yearling heifers ranged from 320c to 385c/kg. Feedlotters were active across the yard which helped lift plainer cattle prices.

The grown steers were 20c to 25c/kg increase. The 500 to 600kg grown steers made from 350c to 385c/kg. The 600kg plus steers made from 335c to 395c/kg to average 378c/kg. 

There was a good line up of fattened dairy cows , however it was the plainer types that saw the greatest gain. Prices for heavy Friesians rose by 10c to 25c/kg.  The beef cows gained 6c to 11c/kg. Beef cows made from 289c to 322c/kg, while the dairy portion made from 255c to 308c/kg. The beef bulls made from 275c to a top of 340c/kg."
