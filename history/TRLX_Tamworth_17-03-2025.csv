Commentary
"Female cattle dominated supply in a penning that almost tripled in size to last weeks reduced penning. The rainfall not enough to make much difference in what has become a fairly plain season. Of those female cows made up a large proportion. Overall the quality of the offering was mixed with condition also varying. There were limited numbers of well finished young cattle, not many heavy grown steers or heifers. It was a similar buying group to the previous sale.

On the back of a reduction in quality the weaner steers to restock sold to cheaper trends. There was not a lot of change in the heifer portion. Light weight yearling steers in limited supply sold to a dearer trend with a breed and quality related improvement. The medium and heavy weights to restock and feed saw quality related price change for the most part with odd dearer sales in both weight classes.  A generally firm market trend for medium and heavy weight yearling heifers with quality related change within the keenly sought breeds accounting for price change.  Extra competition saw the medium and heavy trade yearlings sell to a dearer trend.

With limited processor competition the well finished grown steers and heifers sold to cheaper trends. The large supply of cows sold to cheaper trends of 10c to 15c/kg on the well finished heavy weights while the plainer conditioned medium weights attracted strong competition to show a firm to slightly dearer trend."
