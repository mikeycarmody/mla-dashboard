Commentary
"With a bumper Spring almost guaranteed there was a reduction in numbers. It was a very mixed quality penning that featured a few high quality feeder steers and very good heavyweight cows. There was a reduced gallery of buyers with a couple of the larger processors not participating.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with the lightweight yearling steers mostly dearer under strong restocker competition. Quality was a factor in the dearer prices for the heavyweight yearling feeder steers with the overall trend also showing improvement. Reduced competition on yearling heifers saw all but a few selected pens sell to cheaper trends.

Well finished grown heifers experienced little change while there was some local restocker competition on the plainer conditioned lots. There were a lot less cows in the market with this factor contributing to an improvement in average quality . Market trends firm to dearer however the high price cows were not quite as good as the sale toppers from the previous sale. There was strong competition on the better heavyweight bulls with the market showing some improvement."
