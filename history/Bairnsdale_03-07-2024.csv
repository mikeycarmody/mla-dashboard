Commentary
"There were approximately 180 export and 30 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 370 head from the sale of a fortnight ago. The regular buyers were present and operating in a dearer market. Quality was plain with very few prime cattle and a large proportion of cows. The young and grown cattle were mostly lacking finish and sold a little dearer. Cows kicked up 30c to 60c/kg regaining the losses of last sale. 

Vealers sold from 284c to 320c/kg. A few yearling heifers suited to the trade made between 300c and 330c/kg. A sprinkling of grown steers and bullocks sold between 261c and 310c/kg. Grown heifers with finish made from 280c to 330c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 127c to 240c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 210c and 272c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 210c and 245c/kg. 

Market reporter: Brendan Fletcher."
