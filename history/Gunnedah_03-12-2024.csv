Commentary
"With large rainfall recorded from the drawing areas the numbers fell by 1000 head. Young cattle were again offloaded in large numbers while there was a limited supply of heavy grown cattle apart from cows. The quality of the offering was generally good with the majority of the cattle presenting in forward condition. There was reduced processor competition on cows however all other regular orders were in place. 

The market for light weight steers returning to the paddock was solid resulting in a mostly firm trend. The medium weight steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend improving by as much as 10c/kg. Feedlotters were looking for plenty of weight in their steer purchases regardless of breed with this also resulting in a dearer trend of around 10c/kg. There was little change in the market for light weight yearling heifers. The medium and heavy weights sold on a mostly firm market with an odd cheaper sale.

The limited supply of well finished heavy weight grown steers suitable to processors saw a firm to slightly cheaper trend with some quality related price change. Well finished grown heifers sold on a firm to slightly dearer trend. There were slightly cheaper trends through the cow market with reduced competition and weaker demand."
