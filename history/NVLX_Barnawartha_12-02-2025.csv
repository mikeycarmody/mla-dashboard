Commentary
"Numbers were similar and quality was very good, with increased numbers of young cattle suitable for the trade. Vealer numbers were marginally lower, while heavy grown steers and bullock supplies lifted moderately. A full field of domestic and export buyers were in attendance however fewer feedlots were operating. There were several store buyers in place on plainer conditioned yearlings.

Vealers sold to solid competition, with lighter weight European vealers lifting 10c to 12c and selling from 230c to 256c/kg. Yearling steers suitable for the trade sold to stronger price trends, benefiting from spirited competition from several domestic processors. Yearling trade steers to slaughter averaged 227.5c and reached a top price of 247c/kg for a pen of supplementary fed steers. Medium weight yearling heifers suitable for the trade sold to stronger demand from domestic buyers, with prices lifting 3c, to average 220c/kg. Feedlot competition was minimal and prices were unchanged for steers while heifers to place on feed lifted 10c to 18c/kg. Medium weight C2 steers over 400kg made from 212c to 235c/kg.

It was a very good quality selection of heavy grown steers and bullocks which sold to strong southern competition. Heavy grown steers and bullocks were 2c dearer. The better finished steers and bullocks made from 215c to 236c/kg. Heavy grown heifers were in limited numbers which resulted in a dearer trend of 10c to 16c/kg. The better finished heifers made from 200c to 222c/kg."
"Numbers were similar and quality was excellent, with increased numbers of young cattle grass finished and supplementary fed offered, which were suitable for the trade. Vealer numbers were comparable to the previous sale and quality was outstanding, while heavy grown steers and bullocks were in short supply. The usual field of domestic and export buyers were in attendance however fewer feedlots were operating. There were several store orders in place and secondary lines returning to the paddock sold to cheaper trends.

Vealers sold to stronger demand with European vealers and their crosses unchanged to 5c dearer, selling from 223c to 260c/kg. Yearling steers suitable for the trade sold to much stronger price trends, aided from spirited competition from several domestic processors and select butcher orders. Yearling trade steers to slaughter averaged 238.7c and reached a top price of 246c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers suitable for the trade sold to steady demand from domestic buyers with prices lifting 3c to average 223.7c/kg. Feedlot competition was limited and prices for the lighter weight portion were unchanged while medium weight steers eased 6c/kg. Medium weight C2 steers over 400kg made from 215c to 246c/kg.

It was a very good quality selection of heavy grown steers and bullocks. Heavy grown steers sold to stronger domestic competition, with prices 3c/kg dearer.  Heavy bullocks over 600kg were in limited supply which resulted in a dearer price trend of 9c/kg. The better finished steers and bullocks made from 220c to 239.2c/kg. Friesian bullocks were keenly contested for by southern export processors with prices ranging from 176c to 192c/kg."
"Numbers halved for the first sale held at the new NVLX Barnawatha selling centre. It was a mixed quality offering with all weights and grades represented. Vealer numbers were lower, while yearling cattle were in reasonable supply. Heavy grown steer and bullock numbers declined notably. Not all buyers was in attendance, however there were several local store orders in place with buyers operating across most lines of yearling cattle

Vealers sold to subdued competition, with European vealers and their crosses selling from 206c to 244c/kg. Yearling steers suitable for the trade sold to weakened demand, with the better finished yearlings benefiting from stronger competition from lot feeder buyers. Yearling trade steers to slaughter averaged 222c and reached a top price of 230c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers suitable for the trade sold to stronger demand from domestic buyers and lot feeders, with prices 19c lower to average 203.9c/kg. 

Well-bred yearling steers sold to a smaller group of lot feeder buyers, with only a few orders in place. The bulk of the well-bred steers over 400kg to feed on made from 200c to 246c/kg. Medium weight feeder heifers sold to weakened demand and prices were up to 17c cheaper to average 209.2c/kg.

It was a very good quality selection of heavy grown steers and bullocks, with a mixed selection of steers suitable for manufacturing. Heavy grown steers and bullocks sold to a small group of buyers, with several pen lots passed in. The better finished steers and bullocks made from 200c to 224c/kg."
