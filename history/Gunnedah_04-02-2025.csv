Commentary
"There was a small increase in numbers following the short week. Yearlings were well supplied. Apart from cows there were limited numbers of export cattle. The quality and condition of the offering varied with some of the young cattle looking to have slipped in the heat and deteriorating seasonal conditions. Not all processors participated and some of the feeder orders were subdued.

Restockers were active on the good quality light weight young cattle with the  better quality vealers to restock selling to a slightly dearer trend. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed improved slightly. The price gap between breeds minimal on the good quality lots, particularly the heavier weight feeders. Demand for heifer yearlings to restock and feed was weaker throughout. This resulted in cheaper trends with significant falls in places, more so on the secondary lots.

The weaker processor demand for export cattle resulted in the well finished heavy grown steers selling to cheaper trends. Those trends carried into the grown heifers. There were quality related price variations in some cow classes, most noticeable on the plainer condition lots to process. Overall however the trend was slightly cheaper, up to 13c on the well finished heavy weights. Heavy bulls were as much as 14c/kg cheaper on an improved quality offering."
