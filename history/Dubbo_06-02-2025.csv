Feeder steers sold from 314c to 388c while the feeder heifers sold from 228c to 320c/kg. Young cattle to the restockers and backgrounders were cheaper with the young steers selling to 410c while the young restocker heifers sold to 284c/kg.
 
Grown steers and heifers were 6c to 8c dearer with the prime grown steers selling from 295c to 348c while the prime grown heifers sold from 275c to 332c/kg. Cows were 6c to 9c cheaper with the 2 and 3 scores to the processors selling from 210c to 282c/kg. Prime heavy weight cows sold from 270c to 298c to average 280c/kg.
