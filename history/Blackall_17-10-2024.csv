Commentary
"2,700 head of cattle were yarded for the Blackall Prime sale this week. Cattle were drawn from the local supply area alongside one consignment from the Northern Territory. Overall quality of prime cattle was good with all the usual exporters present and active, while quality was mixed across the yearling pens. 

A large line of vendor bred store steers met good support from local restockers with steers 280 to 330kg selling to 392.2c to average 365c, while heavy feeder steers over 400kg sold to 342.2c averaging 326c/kg. 

Heifers lost ground this week mainly due to quality with heifers 280 to 330kg making to 252.2c to average 232c and medium weight heifers selling to 278.2c to average 262c/kg.

Grown steers to the processor sold to 312.2c to average 293c and heavy heifers made to 280.2c/kg. Medium weight cows topped at 234.2c to average 220c and good heavy cows over 520kg were still pushed along by southern processors selling to 256.2c to average 236c/kg. Heavy bulls made to 242.2c to average 215c/kg.
