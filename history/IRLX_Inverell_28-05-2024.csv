Commentary
"Inverell penned 1276 mixed quality cattle however not all buyers attended to varied market trends.

Light yearling steers to background up 15c/kg with similar weights to feed on were 4c/kg better and selling 224c to 368c/kg.  Steers in the 280 to 330kg bracket sold to cheaper trends of 23c/kg with plainer quality types affecting the averages. Medium weight feeders were 9c/kg dearer to top at 340c/kg. Yearling heifers sold to a mostly cheaper trends with a lack of quality a factor. Light heifers to restockers and backgrounders resulted in a 24c/kg loss 230c to 280c/kg. Medium weight feeders slipped 18c/kg.

Grown heifers significantly cheaper selling 200c to 246c/kg. All cows were subject to negative corrections. Medium weights back substantially and the heavy three and four score drafts averaging losses of 12c/kg selling 187c to 222c/kg. Buying demand for cows to the paddock slipped 23c/kg but still topped at 209c/kg.
