Commentary
"There were approximately 146 export and 10 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 140 head week-on-week. An order rejoined the regular buyers after a short absence operating in a dearer market. Quality was limited to a single pen of grown steers as cows represented most of the sale. The steers sold firm. Cows improved from 10c to 25c/kg with restocker demand stronger for light cows. Heavy bulls eased 5c/kg. 

The pen of grown steers made 350c/kg. Light and medium weight cows sold from 128c to 280c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 210c and 338c/kg. Heavy bulls made from 234c to 262c/kg.
