Commentary
"There was a slightly small yarding of 121 trade and export cattle with a smaller percentage of cows and more grown cattle and yearlings.
The market was strong throughout with both steer and heifer yearlings making 330c to 360c while grown steers sold from 322c to 356c.

There were about 50 cows and this market improved 5c to 10c with heavy beef cows making 300c to 320c, medium 250c to 300c and light lean cows 120c to 200c/kg live weight.
