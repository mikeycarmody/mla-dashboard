Commentary
"Hot and humid conditions greeted attendees at this weeks cattle market which perhaps saw vendors holding onto hope of the predicted looming rain forecast as agents yarded a reduced penning of 573 cattle. Quality was mixed with more secondary types offered lacking the bloom and finish seen recently. Added re-stocker and processor interest saw a generally strong market from the opening whistle.
 
Light steer weaners reversed last weeks lack luster demand to be generally dearer by 17c to 22c/kg trading from 275c to 414c/kg. Heavier types over 330kg also dearer sentiments of 28c/kg selling from 328c to 382c/kg. Weaner heifers followed suit making from 250c to 326c/kg to be anywhere from 9c to 44c/kg dearer. Over 330kg dearer by 18c/kg making from 292c to 316c/kg.
 
Medium and heavy yearling steers back to the paddock and feed saw some sharp gains of up to 43c/kg selling from 250c to 346c/kg. Medium and heavy heifer yearlings to the lot feeders saw a spike of 20c/kg trading from 282c to 302c/kg.
 
Hard to gauge a quote on heavy processor steers and heifers as mainly singles were put up for sale and they sold in the range of 240c to 332c/kg. Around 50 cows were offered, 2 scores back 5c/kg making from 210c to 260c/kg whilst the heavy 3 and 4 scores averaged around firm selling from 270c to 282c/kg.
