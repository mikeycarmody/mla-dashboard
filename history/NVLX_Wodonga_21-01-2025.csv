Commentary
"It was a  smaller field of Summer buyers that made it to the sale. Quality was fair to very good. The  market was solid with a Northern restockers underpinning yearlings and weaner cattle. Northern restocker  buyers dominated the vealer sale with processors not willing to push the market.
 
It was a mixed selection of vealers on offer and restockers  and feedlots purchased all plainer types.  The pick of the vealers selling to processors, sold at 308c to 358c/kg. Vealers back to the paddock made from 312c to 350c/kg. Trade steers and heifers fetched 312c 347c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers sold to solid competition making from 306c to 384c/kg. There was good numbers of heifers to suit feedlots and they sold at 285c to 322c/kg.
 
In the export market  competition was weaker. Heavy steers averaged 330c/kg with the pick purchased by lot feeders. Bullocks sold to a smaller group of buyers to average 342c/kg. A large offering of cows met a smaller field of buyers and prices were softer for heavy types. Heavy cows traded between 285c to 309c/kg. It was a notably weaker market for leaner grades under 520kg. D3 cows sold from 235c to 287c/kg.  Heavy bulls sold at varying prices, the bulk of heaviest types making from 277c to 320c/kg."
