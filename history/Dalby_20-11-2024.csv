Commentary
"
The return to good falls of rain across most of the supply area reduced cattle numbers at Dalby by 1,411 head to 3,305. Export buyer attendance was good and the buying panel in the young cattle section improved with the return of one operator.

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock experienced only quality related price changes. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market followed a similar trend. However heavy weight yearling steers to feed averaged 10c/kg better and the over 480kg lines were noticeably dearer. Light weight yearling heifers returning to the paddock improved in price by 6c to 16c/kg. Heavy weight yearling heifers to feed averaged 12c/kg dearer. Cows were firm to 5c/kg better.      

Light weight yearling steers to restockers averaged 397c and sold to 427c with some under 200kg to 432c/kg. Medium weight yearling steers to feed averaged from 372c to 377c with the occasional sale to 406c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed averaged 375c and made to 390c with some over 480kg also making to 390c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers returning to the paddock averaged from 296c to 321c with sales to 346c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed averaged from 314c to 331c with an outstanding pen to 360c/kg. Heavy weight yearling heifers to feed made to 352c to average 334c/kg.    

Bullocks made to 360c to average 354c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows made to 266c to average 259c/kg. Heavy weight 3 score cows averaged 281c and made to 285c while the best of the cows made to 290c to average 288c/kg. Heavy weight bulls made to 296c/kg.
