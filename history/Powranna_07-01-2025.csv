Commentary
"There was a very small yarding of 37 cattle at Powranna on Tuesday being the first sale for 2025. With small numbers butchers were keen to get their share and paid 300c to 350c for yearling steers and 338c to 354c for heifers while some secondary yearlings made 266c to 302c.

Good quality grown steers made 340c to 380c/kg live.
