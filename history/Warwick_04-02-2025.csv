Commentary
"Warwick agents penned 1,046 mixed quality cattle. With the absence of one major processor prices for the export lines could not maintain last weeks rates and eased by 3c to 15c on the cows with heavy bulls the most affected. Heavy feeder lines sold to similar prices to last sale with most restocker yearlings selling to dearer trends for the better quality lines on offer. 

Light weight yearling steers to restockers made 438c to average 388c/kg. Yearling steers over 280kg to background sold to 370c and averaged 353c/kg. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market made 346c with restockers paying to 366c/kg. Heavy yearling steers to feed averaged 338c and sold to 348c with those to the wholesale meat trade at 389c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers to background averaged 323c with the occasional isolated sale to 502c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed for the domestic market made 350c with those to restockers at 368c to average 332c/kg. Heavy yearling heifers to wholesalers sold to 374c/kg. 

Grown steers to processors made 310c to average 293c/kg. Grown heifers to processors made 296c to average 286/kg. Light weight cows to processors sold to 250c and averaged 238c/kg. Heavy score 2 cows to processors made 268c and averaged 266c with the best heavy cows topping at 280c to average 270c/kg. Light weight bulls to restockers sold to 330c and averaged 297c/kg.
