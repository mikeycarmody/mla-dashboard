Commentary
"The recent uplift in prices has seen a significant increase in the supply of cattle, resulting in a prime only sale with 2328 cattle penned. Quality was mixed, however there were several large lines of good quality heavy bullocks and cows. All processors were in attendance and operating, supported by one live exporter and regular feeders. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Mt Garnet, Hughenden local and coastal areas. 

There was only a limited number of yearling cattle due to a store sale being held on Friday. Processor demand  was strong throughout, although most categories eased on last weekâ€™s gains primarily due to the increased supply and some pens lacking weight. Grown steers eased 15c, heifers averaged 6c to 22c lower, heavy bullocks fell 17c, medium weight cows averaged 3c to 16c lower, however heavy bulls to processors improved by up to 20c/kg. 

A small sample of yearling heifers above 280kg to processors sold to 260c to average 258c, heifers above 330kg to feed averaged 257c, while heifers above 400kg to the trade sold to 278c to average 276c/kg. 

Grown steers above 400kg to feed sold to 282c, trade types made to 318c to average 294c/kg. Increased numbers of heavy grown steers above 500kg to processors reached 320c to average 308c and a good sample of steers above 600kg also topped at 320c to average 312c/kg. Mixed quality small lines of grown heifers to the trade sold to 268c to average 248c to 266c/kg.

Heavy full mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 328c to average 307c, lighter bullocks averaged 295c/kg. Lightweight 2 score cows to processors made to 252c to average 247c, 3 scores averaged 252c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows sold to an isolated 275c, most 240c to 250c, 3 scores reached 288c to average 263c to 273c/kg. A good number of prime heavyweight 3 and 4 score cows sold to 288c to average 273c to 280c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export 286c, averaging 253c to 263c, processor bulls reached 298c to average 238c to 268c/kg.

A small number of cows and calves sold for $775per unit.

Approximately 2,200 cattle have been booked for a store sale on Friday.
