Commentary
"There were approximately 580 export and 60 young cattle penned representing an increase of 120 head from the sale of a fortnight ago. Another order rejoined the regulars after a short absence and most were operating in a cheaper market. Quality was limited with cows and secondary cattle well supplied. The young cattle sold mostly to restockers 10c to 25c/kg cheaper. Grown steers and bullocks eased 25c/kg. Manufacturing steers lost 20c to 40c/kg. Cows slipped 30c/kg while heavy bulls sold firm. 

Yearling trade steers sold from 278c to 285c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade made between 260c and 280c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold between 245c and 280c/kg. 

Heavy Friesian manufacturing steers made from 215c to 219c with the crossbred portion from 227c to 264c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 110c to 215c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 180c and 253c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 230c and 252c/kg.
