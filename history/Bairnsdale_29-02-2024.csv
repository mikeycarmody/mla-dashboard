Commentary
"There were approximately 475 export and 75 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 90 head from the sale of a fortnight ago. An export processor rejoined the regular buyers after a long absence in a dearer market in places. Quality improved with a better selection of prime cattle and more finish throughout. Finished trade cattle sold close to firm while plainer young cattle sold up to 45c/kg cheaper. Grown cattle sold mostly 15c to 30c/kg dearer with quality playing a role. Heavy cows sold from 5c to 15c/kg dearer while a buyer not operating on leaner grades saw prices up to 15c/kg cheaper and sparked more interest from restockers. Heavy bulls lost 7c/kg. 

A couple of vealers lacking finish sold from 250c to 275c/kg. Yearling heifers suited to the trade made between 255c and 275c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold between 258c and 306c/kg. 

Heavy manufacturing steers made from 220c to 287c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 110c to 235c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 190c and 264c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 219c and 244c/kg.
