Commentary
"   Numbers climbed at Naracoorte today as agents offered 807 head of liveweight and open auction cattle with 79 of these being open auction calves. These was a larger field of trade and processor buyers with a couple of regulars returning to the rail. Quality fell away this week barring a few pens coming off grain in a mixed market for price.
   Yearling steers to the trade sold from 265c to 384c with similar heifers selling from 255c to 380c/kg. Feeders were active on steers from 246c to 370c and on the heifers from 255c to 322c/kg. 
   Grown steers and bullocks attracted trade support from 340c to 386c as feeders operated to 334c/kg. Grown heifers sold from 288c to 364c as feeders were active from 282c to 336c/kg. 
   Heavy cows eased 3c as they sold from 280c to 345c with lighter lots making from 195c to 285c as bulls ranged from 160c to 310c/kg.
