Total Yarding: 1800 (NQ)
Commentary
"A total of 1800 head of cattle were yarded for the weekly Blackall prime and store sale. Good numbers of heavy prime cows and grown steers were yarded and were met by firm competition from all the usual processors. Feeder cattle and light weight yearlings could not maintain the levels of the previous week mainly due to quality and buyers operated selectively. 

Restocker steers 280 to 330kg sold to 378.2c to average 367c, heavy feeders steers sold to 335c to average 310c/kg and feeder heifers sold to 262.2c to average 249c/kg.

Heavy heifers to the processor sold to 258.2c, heavy grown steers sold to 286.2c to average 272c and medium cows sold to 225c to average 220c/kg. Good heavy cows remained firm selling to 242.2c to average 234c and the addition of a live export order saw heavy bulls to 246.2c/kg.
A run of good quality young cows and calves sold from $1800 to $1980/unit.
