Commentary
"Numbers eased by 420 for a yarding of 800 cattle. Quality was mixed, heavy prime cattle were well supplied along with good numbers of cows and feeder weights. Most of the regular buyers were present.

Prime yearling steers to the processors were 5c dearer, 220c to 384c and yearling heifers were 15c cheaper, 300c to 370c/kg. Feeder steers gained 6c, 240c to 398c and feeder heifers were down 10c, 255c to 340c/kg. 

Prime grown cattle were 8c to 14c dearer, heavy steers sold from 280c to 382c and heavy heifers, 250c to 372c/kg. Cows held firm, 2 and 3 scores sold from 174c to 288c and heavy prime cows, 290c to 314c/kg.  Bulls sold to 267c/kg.
