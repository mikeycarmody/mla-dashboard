Commentary
"There was a small reduction in numbers with unproductive cows plentiful. Yearlings heifers also saw an increase in numbers. The overall quality of the offering was very mixed as was quality. There were some very well finished cattle to suit processors however a large portion of the penning were showing the effects of the cooler weather. Not all regular processors were in attendance however all the regular feedlot orders were in place.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with restocker steers weaners selling on a firm to cheaper trend. The better quality lines showing little change. The trend was similar for the heifer portion. Light weight yearling steers sold to cheaper trends. Medium weight steers experienced little change however the heavy weight feeder steers saw a firm to dearer trend with breed and quality contributing.  Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to feed saw a firm to cheaper trend with a greater emphasis placed on the heavier weights. The increased supply brought about a large quality related price change in the negative on the medium weights.

There were too few well finished heavy grown steers to quote. The well finished grown heifers to process sold to cheaper trends with prices showing a moderate fall. The plain condition cows were least affected in a cheaper market trend. They were somewhat underpinned by restocker activity. The well finished cows met with weaker demand from processors to show significant price reductions."
