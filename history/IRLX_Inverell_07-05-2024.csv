Commentary
"Numbers reduced by 820 head penning 214 very mixed cattle at Inverell. Trends varied with processors and restockers strong on light heifers. Not all buyers attended.

Weaner steers up 8c/kg to restockers and the heifer portion considerably  dearer to backgrounder competition. Processor heifers lifted 11c/kg . Yearling steers to the paddock slipped 3c/kg topping at 334c/kg and medium feeders also significantly cheaper owing to less numbers and a quality correction. 

There were no numbers of grown steers or heifers for a reliable quote. Medium cows marginally dearer making to 187c/kg . Heavy weight cows slipped 8c/kg  selling 185 to 229c/kg. The bull market topped at 232c/kg .
