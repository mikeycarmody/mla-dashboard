Commentary
"There was a reduction in supply. An influx of empty females brought on by the pregnancy testing season being in full swing. The quality of the offering was very mixed with few good lines penned. The condition varied greatly with quite a few of the cows down in condition after having reared calves. There were very few weaners penned with upcoming weaner sales holding them back. The regular processors operated however there was reduced restocker and feedlot competition.

That reduced competition combined with a drop in quality saw the weaner steers to restockers sell to a considerably cheaper trend while the heifer portion suffered greater losses. Light weight yearling steers to restockers followed a similar trend. Medium and heavy weight yearling feeder steers while cheaper were a lot less affected than those to restock. There was a quality related positive price change on medium weight yearling heifers however the market trend was generally cheaper with the secondary quality lots greatly affected. The good quality lots held up reasonably well.

Heavy grown steers to process met with weaker demand to sell to a dearer trend of as much as 17c/kg. Grown heifers also sold to cheaper trends. The cow market was substantially cheaper weaker processor demand and an increased supply. The plainer condition cow market was underpinned somewhat by several restocker orders. Heavy bulls sold to a much cheaper trend. There were not many very good sound bulls penned."
