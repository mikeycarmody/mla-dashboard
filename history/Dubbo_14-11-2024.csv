Commentary
"Numbers lifted and the quality was good. There were plenty of yearlings in forward condition which were in demand from feeders and processors. Grown steers and bullock were back in volume for the prime lines but improved numbers for the export feeders. There were still good lines of heavy cows. The market sold to mixed trends. Feeders and restockers paid more and the prime processing cattle and cows were cheaper.
 
Feeder steers were 15c to 20c stronger and again the crossbreds had some of the biggest gains. Medium weight steers to feed sold from 264c to 380c and heavy weights 320c to 377c/kg. Feeder heifers were up 8c to 12c with the bulk selling between 270c and 323c/kg. Prime trade cattle were back 8c with heifers reaching 336c/kg.
 
The leaner grown steers to feed were  up 10c on average with a big line of light 2 tooths reaching 376c/kg which was well above the average gain. Prime steers and bullocks were back around 10c and sold from 312c to 340c/kg and the heavy grown heifers were back a similar rate selling from 290c to 328c/kg. Heavy 3 and 4 score cows were 20c to 25c softer ranging from 258c to 290c and the medium weights 2 scores 209c to 255c/kg."
