Commentary
"There were approximately 280 export and 55 young cattle penned representing an increase of 120 head week-on-week. There was one export processor absent after operating last sale with all of the regular buyers present and operating in a dearer market in places. Quality improved with a far better selection of trade and grown cattle on offer. Trade cattle prices were significantly higher than recent sales in line with quality. Grown steers and bullocks sold to solid demand. Cows sold up to 5c/kg easier to processors. Heavy bulls lifted 15c/kg. 

Yearling trade steers sold from 406c to 430c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade made between 316c and 438c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold between 352c and 380c/kg. 

Manufacturing steers made from 286c to 318c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 218c to 315c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 262c and 338c/kg. Light and medium weight restocking cows sold between 160c and 280c/kg. Heavy bulls made from 318c to 368c/kg.
