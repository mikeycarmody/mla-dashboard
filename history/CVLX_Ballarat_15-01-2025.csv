Commentary
"The first prime cattle sale of 2025 drew a significant crowd of onlookers, backgrounders, feedlot operators, and processors, all eager to witness the latest trends in the market. The sale featured magnificent pens of well-finished cows and an impressive selection of heavy bulls.

However, trade cattle were somewhat scarce, with most on offer in secondary condition. Medium-weight feeder steers were highly sought after by several feedlots, fetching prices ranging from 310 to 376c/kg. Lighter-weight steers also attracted attention, topping at 364 cents and averaging 337c/kg.

Feeder heifers were in reasonable supply, with those weighing between 330 and 400 kilograms selling from 288c to 340c averaging around $1,168 per head. The prices for steers returning to the paddock varied significantly, largely influenced by breed. These steers fetched between 242c and 360c/kg reflecting a diverse range of quality and buyer preference. Similarly, heifers returning to the paddock with weight and frame were sold at prices ranging from 260c to 294c/kg

A handful of trade steers and heifers sold  between 255 and 324c/kg.

On the export front, the supply of heavy steers and bullocks was limited, with prices ranging from 310c to 346c/kgThe highlight of the sale was undoubtedly the magnificent lineup of heavy cows, which attracted a larger group of buyers than in previous sales. Prices surged by 40c compared to the last pre-Christmas sale, with good heavy cows selling between 310c and 329c/kg. Leaner cows weighing under 520kg were also in demand, selling from 258c to 304c/kg.

The sale featured an excellent selection of big heavy bulls, commanding prices between 300c to  332c/kg"
