Commentary
"The first sale for the year produced a yarding of 3689. It was a pretty good quality yarding with good numbers of prime cattle in all sections along with the usual runs of Bos Indicus cattle. Most of the usual buyers were in attendance and keen to secure numbers.
 
Limited numbers of young cattle to the trade were dearer with B muscle Limousin steer vealers selling to 390c/kg. Young cattle to the restockers were also a little dearer with young steers selling from 375c to 437c while the young restocker heifers sold from 332c to 391c/kg. Young Santa Gertrudis bull calves sold to 510c/kg to the restockers. Feeder cattle were 15c to 20c dearer with the feeder steers selling from 350c to 418c while the feeder heifers sold from 310c to 370c/kg.
 
Grown steers and heifers were up to 30c dearer with the prime grown steers selling from 341c to 398c/kg. Prime grown heifers sold from 330c to 357c/kg. Cows were 25c to 30c dearer with the prime heavy weights selling from 307c to 340c/kg. Secondary 3 score cows sold from 287c to 310c/kg. Bulls sold to 329c/kg.
