Commentary
"With just one sale left before the Christmas break there was an increase in supply. That increase was mostly made up of feeder cattle. Young cattle made up by far the largest percentage of the offering with the majority in the medium and heavy weight classes. The quality of the young cattle was generally very good with condition also good. There were limited supplies of well finished export steers and heifers while there was a fair supply of cows. There were a couple of absentees in the buying group.

Strong demand from restockers and feedlotters resulted in dearer trends through the yearling steers with light weights to restock and feed up to 6c/kg dearer. A greater emphasis was placed on the medium and heavy weights with medium weights as much as 14c dearer while heavy weights to background and feed saw improvement of as much as 10c/kg with little in the way of breed premiums. Light weight yearling heifers sold to a slightly cheaper trend with a limited supply and some variation in quality.The medium and heavy weight heifers sold to a dearer trend of as much as 10c/kg. 

Well finished heavy grown steers to process experienced little change while the well finished heavy grown heifers were keenly sought. The best of them were as much as 20c/kg dearer. There was also strong processor demand in the cow market with market trends showing significant improvement."
