Commentary
"Tamworth numbers doubled to 2247 mixed cattle with no sale last Monday. Numbers were a factor through the market which saw trends cheaper for most categories. There was also a quality correction in the secondary drafts. Feeder competition was still strong for the better types. Cows were cheaper and the regular buyers attended.

The lead of the weaner steers to dearer trends of 10c/kg while the secondary drafts were 10/kg cheaper selling 360c to 400c/kg. The weaner heifers were considerably cheaper losing 54c/kg. All weaners purchased by restockers. Light yearling steers slipped 56c/kg with this category going to background competition. Similar weights to feed on were 44c/kg back but medium weights sold to firm trends and topped at 399c/kg. Heavy feeders rallied and made to 340c/kg. Light feeder heifers lost 10c/kg and the medium weights slipped 34c/kg to sell 225c to 324c/kg.

Grown steers to process made 275/kg with the heifers portion selling 215c to 225c/kg. Cows saw the brunt of correction with medium weights back 27c/kg and heavy cows losing 42c/kg topping at 220c/kg. Heavy bulls increased 9c/kg making 252c/kg.
