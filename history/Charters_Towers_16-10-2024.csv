Commentary
"Numbers decreased by 643 for a yarding of 2327 cattle.  Quality was very mixed comprising of fewer numbers of heavy bullocks and cows, supported by several small lines of store steers and heifers with many lines reflecting the dry season.  All regular processors were in attendance and operating, supported by one live exporter, feeders and opportunity restockers. Demand for heavier well finished lines was firm, however lesser quality and lighter weight lines continued to struggle to attract buyer support. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Richmond, north to Georgetown and south to the local area.

Values for all categories were reflective of quality, with better quality lines improving by up to 30c and lesser types being further discounted. Yearling heifers above 280kg to feed improved 16c to 38c, prime grown steers and bullocks improved 4c to 15c, prime heifers lifted 3c to 9c and prime cows averaged 5c to 6c lower.

Light restocker steers returning to the paddock averaged 268c to 307c, reaching a top of 317c, similar heifers to processors sold to 222c to average 192c/kg. Yearling steers above 200kg to backgrounders reached 300c, a good sample averaging 298c and secondary types averaged 267c/kg. Yearling steers above 280kg to live export sold to 284c to average 274c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed above 200kg averaged 195c to 208c, with heifers above 280kg making to 250c to average 227c to 241c/kg.

Grown steers above 400kg to processors averaged 272c to 299c reaching 306c, feeders averaged 258c/kg. A reduced number of grown heifers reached 286c to average 245c to 266c/kg.  A smaller supply of heavy full mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 320c multiple times to average 286c to 304c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows made to 218c to average 196c, 3 scores reached 264c to average 239c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export sold to 272c to average 268c/kg.
