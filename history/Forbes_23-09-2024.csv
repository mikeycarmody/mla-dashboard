Commentary
"There was a slight increase in numbers and the overall quality improved, with more runs of feeder steers. Trade cattle were well supplied, along with some well-finished heavy steers and bullocks and there were 385 cows. All the usual buyers were operating, selling to a firm to slightly softer market. Prime yearlings to suit the trade sold from 330c to 365c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers were a few cents better, making from 370c to 416c/kg, and the heavy weights were price unchanged, ranging from 350c to 375c/kg. Strong demand for heifers from the feedlot buyers resulted in price gains of 15c, topping at 360c/kg.

Heavy grown steers were a few cents cheaper, selling from 330c to 360c, and grown heifers were also cheaper, making from 290c to 335c/kg. Cows were up to 12c cheaper. Lighter 2 scores made from 155c to 230c, and heavy secondary types sold from 240c to 290c/kg. Heavy prime cows averaged 317c/kg. The best heavy weight bull to process reached 292c/kg.
