Commentary
"There were approximately 310 export and 50 young cattle penned representing an increase of 20 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present but not all operating fully in a mixed market. Quality declined with fewer prime lots and a smaller proportion of cows. Young cattle sold firm to restockers as there were few suited to the trade. A handful of grown steers and bullocks sold firm. Manufacturing steers eased a little with quality an issue. Light conditioned dairy cows eased 10c to 15c while heavy beef cows improved 5c to 10c/kg. Heavy bulls gained 5c/kg. 

A few yearling steers to restockers made 318c with the heifer portion from 236c to 274c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks made between 329c and 345c/kg. Manufacturing steers sold between 222c and 288c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made from 190c to 267c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly from 254c to 305c/kg. Heavy bulls made between 245c and 290c/kg.
