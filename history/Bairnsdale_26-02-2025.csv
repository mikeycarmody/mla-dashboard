Commentary
"There were approximately 420 export and 70 young cattle penned representing an increase of 190 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a generally firm market. Quality was limited with cows representing most of the sale. Well finished trade cattle sold 10c/kg dearer while restocking demand was firm for secondary lots. The limited selection of grown cattle eased 10c/kg with quality an issue. Heavy cows sold firm on most sales while lighter lots were dearer with restockers competing for suitable lines. Heavy bulls lifted 5c to 10c/kg. 

Vealers sold from 270c to 340c/kg. Yearling steers to restockers made between 290c and 331c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade sold between 330c and 340c with restocking lots between 290c and 318c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks made from 315c to 348c/kg. 

Manufacturing steers sold from 310c to 340c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made between 230c and 310c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly between 260c and 330c/kg. Restocking cows made from 170c to 310c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 290c to 326c/kg.
