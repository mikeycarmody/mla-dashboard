Commentary
"Blackall combined agents yarded 6,400 head of cattle for the September weaner and store sale. Overall quality was good with some very good quality runs of heavy feeder steers and heifers on offer. Medium weight feeder cattle were well supplied and, while prices for  plainer light weight cattle struggled, well bred pens of light weight restocker steers saw some improvements. 

Buyers were selective on light weight cattle, aiming for a heavier article, with steers 200 to 280kg selling to 420.2c to average 379c, restocker steers 280 to 330kg also made to 420.2c to average 374c and medium weight steers 330 to 400kg returning to the paddock sold to 390.2c averaging 358c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers sold to 376.2c to average 361c and the return of a heavy feeder operator saw prices to 374.2c to average 364c/kg. 

Light weight restocker heifers struggled compared to the heavier heifer pens with the top price of 320.2c to average 257c while heifers 280 to 330kg sold to 320.2c to average 270c/kg. Competition from the western downs for medium weight heifers to feed saw prices to 312.2c to average 272c and some very good runs of heavy PTE feeder heifers sold to 335.2c averaging 320c/kg.

A limited number of fat cattle were yarded this week, with heavy heifers to the processor making to 305.2c and heavy grown steers selling to 310.2c to average 299c/kg.  The absence of the southern export processors saw medium cows selling to 240.2c to average 226c and good heavy cows over 520kg top at 260.2c to average 255c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 258.2c/kg.
