Commentary
"There were approximately 240 export and 20 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 70 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a mostly firm market which was cheaper in places. Quality was limited with cows making up the majority of the sale. A handful of young cattle suited to the trade sold firm. A sprinkling of manufacturing steers improved slightly. Heavy beef cows sold firm while lighter conditioned lots eased up to 7c/kg. Heavy bulls lost 10c to 30c/kg. 

Yearling heifers to the trade sold from 380c to 436c/kg. A pen of grown steers made 363c/kg. Manufacturing steers made between 300c and 350c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold between 216c and 313c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly from 283c to 346c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 288c to 350c/kg. 

Market reporter: Brendan Fletcher."
