Commentary
"It was a much larger yarding for the 1st sale back for 2025. Not all major processors made it to the sale. Buyers competed over a mixed yarding with a fair percentage selling to back grounders and feedlots.
 
Vealers were in short supply, fetching 310c-373c/kg. Trade steers and heifers were in limited numbers, selling from 322-352c/kg. The bulk of the yearling steers sold to lot feeders, with medium weights selling from 300c-366c/kg. The heifer portion met only a small group of buyers, resulting in prices slipping 9c, making from 305-334c/kg.
 
The export market was well supported, with several buyers vying for the younger, well-finished steers. Prices improved 20c-23c on last yearâ€™s December market. Heavy steers and bullocks sold between 336c-384c/kg. Cows sold to spirited bidding, with heavy cows keenly sought. Heavy cows sold at 296-321c/kg. Leaner grades under 520kg sold at 255-295c/kg."
