Commentary
"Gunnedah penned 2950 very good quality cattle 600 less than last sale. Cows were a standout with both quality and weight. All regular buyers attended for a firm to dearer cow market but yearlings in general resulted in a softer trend.

Weaner steers to a cheaper trend 374c to 412c/kg to restockers and heifers 298c to 332c/kg. Light background steers 390c to 420c/kg feeders cheaper 320c to 360c/kg. Feeder and background steers under 330kgs to a cheaper trend 365c and 368c/kg respectively. Medium feeders firm 340c to 388c/kg and a large draft of heavy feeders to 383c/kg. Feeder and background  heifers under 330kgs were firm 315c and 396c/kg respectively. Medium feeders 304c to 372c/kg and heavy feeder heifers to 331c/kg.

Heavy grown heifers to process 315c to 328c/kg. Medium cows 210c to 264c/kg. Heavy cows to a solid market 304c to 320c/kg. Heavy bulls 265c to 310c/kg.
