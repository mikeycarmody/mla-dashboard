Commentary
"There was a reduction in supply with cows making up a larger percentage of the offering. The quality and condition of the yarding was very mixed and had an impact on average prices in some categories. The usual buyers were in attendance with demand for most classes strong.

Restockers were active through the light weight young cattle with weaner steers selling to a dearer trend, improving by as much as 20c/kg. The heifer portion saw a slightly dearer trend. Lightweight yearling steers to restockers posted strong gains however there was a large quality related price range with buyers prepared to pay for the well finished lines while discounting the secondary and plain quality steers. Medium and heavy weight feeder steers were cheaper with few straight lines available. Quality was also a factor in price change. Well finished young cattle suitable to the trade were scarce with these selling to a much dearer trend. Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to feed sold to a slightly cheaper trends.

Processor demand for well finished grown cattle was strong with both the heavy weight grown steers and heifers selling to dearer trends, odd sales posting significant improvement. Demand for cows was again high from processors with restockers also active on suitable lines of plain condition cows. The market continued its recent upward surge with the well finished heavy weights as much as 17c/kg dearer."
