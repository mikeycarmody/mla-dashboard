Commentary
"The numbers almost doubled with an influx of cows. All categories were well represented in a mixed quality penning. There was a good supply of young cattle . The condition of the offering was fair to good with quite a lot of plainer condition cows alongside the well finished lines. The young cattle also showed a deal of variation. There were a few new faces in the buying gallery that also had some absentees.

Despite the increase in supply the young cattle market was strong under high demand. Weaner steers to restock in all weight categories sold to dearer trends with some quality related price change. There was little change in the heifer weaners to restock. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed sold on a firm to dearer trend with the strongest gains in the well finished heavy weights where quality was a factor. There was increased demand for yearling heifers with those to restock and feed selling to a dearer trend.

Grown steers with 2 or more teeth going to feed saw considerable price improvement with breed and quality contributing. The plainer condition and lightly muscled grown heifers to feed sold strongly on a cents per kilogram basis in comparison to the more forward heavier weight. The well finished heifers to process sold to a dearer trend. Strong competition for all classes of cows resulted in dearer trends throughout with some quality related price gains."
