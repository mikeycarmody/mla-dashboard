"Numbers were up slightly, compared to last week. All the usual buyers were in attendance; however local restockers failed to operate with confidence due to the dry seasonal conditions across the region. Cattle in prime condition to suit the trade were well supplied in both the vealer and yearling categories. Quality lines of secondary cattle suitable for the feeders and restockers were in good numbers, and these pens were dominated by the feeder buyers. The export cattle were of reasonable quality considering the size of the yarding and sold to a solid trend in the heavy steers, however the cow categories slipped due to lacklustre buyer demand.

The middle weights sold from 292c to 329c and the heavy weights topped at 334c/kg. Improved quality yearling heifers to processors saw prices lift to make from 195c to 322c/kg. Feeder steers were cheaper averaging 276c/kg for those weighing 330-400kg. Heifers going to feed were firm reaching 255c/kg. Restocker weaner steers were up to 28c dearer making from 159c to 289c/kg, depending on quality. Young heifers returning to the paddock were also dearer, receiving from 139c to 235c/kg.

The increased number of grown heifers were up to 20c cheaper topping at 250c/kg. Two score cows were 11c cheaper to average 151c and the heavier 3 score cows were also cheaper making from 155c to 215c/kg. The best heavy weight bull reached 230c/kg."
"Numbers were reduced, in what was an average quality yarding of cattle across all grades. All the usual gallery of buyers were present, however not all orders operated.  Cow numbers declined significantly to 35 head, along with the other grades of export cattle, that had a higher percentage of 6 and 8 tooth cattle offered. Prime Vealers and Yearlings off supplementary feed to suit the domestic processors were in reasonable supply, with buyers fighting hard against feeder orders to secure cattle for the kill. Well- bred secondary cattle numbers were reduced, though this did not deter restockers, with restocker-competition from outside of the local area, again setting the market pace. For the second week running, record prices per kg were achieved on the lighter grade steers at 459c and heifers 405c/kg to return to the paddock.

Prime Vealers sold to the trade from 385c to 411c, with the market lifting 2c to 7c/kg. Trade Yearling steers sold from 385c to 404c, lifting 5c in the medium weights and 7c/kg in the heavy grade.

Restocker yearling and vealer steers sold between 387c to 459c, prices jumping up to 30c/kg on the lighter weight cattle. Prime Yearling heifers to the trade sold from 353c to 405c, with prices jumping 17c on the medium weights from 13c to 23c/kg. Yearling Heifers to the feeder orders sold to increased demand, trading from 340c to 383c, lifting 24c/kg in the medium weight grade. Yearling Heifers returning to the paddock sold to very strong restocker demand, trading between 389c and 405c, jumping 27c/kg on the lighter grade weaned cattle.

Heavy Steers and Bullocks traded between 280c to 377c, with the heavy prime portion lifting 19c/kg on last sale. The pens of heavy grown Heifers sold between 310c to 351c, with the better shaped heifers lifting 19c/kg. Heavy well covered cows weighing over 520kg sold between 265c to 289c, improving 18c/kg. Medium weight plain conditioned cows, weighing below 520kg, sold between 230c to 255c, lifting 4c/kg. Heavy Bulls sold from 240c and 273c, easing 11c/kg on average."
"Numbers were reduced 8% from the previous week, in what was a mixed quality yarding of cattle.  The usual field of domestic and export buyers were present, along with another export cow order from the north of the state.  There was also a return of a feedlot order after a short absence. The number of restocker orders was reduced from the previous sale, which reduced the competition on the secondary line of stock. There was an increased quantity of well-presented cattle off supplementary feed and crop that were suitable for the processors and feedlot, and competition on better presented lines was strong across all categories. Plainer quality cattle met with reduced competition in the trade weights.

Vealer steers and heifers to suit the trade were better supplied.  There was a larger run of calves under 200kg that sold to both processors and local restockers, trading between 220c to 424c/kg.  The vealer steers selling to the trade were steady and sold between 281c to 347c/kg, with restockers and feeders purchasing the majority.  The vealer heifer portion traded between 285c to 347c, to average 331c/kg for the better quality trade portion. Yearling steers purchased by the trade were cheaper by up to 36c in the plainer lighter grades and up 15c for the better finished portion, ranging between 240c and 344c/kg. Feedlot buyers were purchasing yearlings between 270c to 330c, which was steady to 20c/kg dearer on the better presented cattle.  Restockers were more reserved on the secondary lines, with prices easing 5c to 10c on last weekâ€™s sale to make between 240c to 324c/kg. Better quality yearling heifers were again well sought after by the trade and sold from 239c to 336c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed were steady to 9c dearer, selling from 247c to 296c/kg. Restockers purchased the balance of the heifers between 239c to 283c/kg, which mirrored the previous weekâ€™s market.

A reduced, mixed quality offering of grown steers and bullocks sold to both domestic and export competition.  Prices traded between 240c to 318c, to average 269c/kg. Heavy grown heifers were in limited supply and again the quality was mixed, they traded between 220c to 325c, to average 267c/kg.  The export cow market category had the greatest lift for the week. Heavy cows weighing over 520kg were up to 21c dearer on lasts weeksâ€™ sale, trading between 218c to 255c/kg. Lighter cows, weighing below 520kg, traded between 190c to 242c, improving 13c/kg from the previous week.  Heavy bulls were in limited numbers and traded 10c cheaper, selling to an average of 259c/kg."
"Numbers were down 35% from the previous week, in what was on average a better quality yarding of cattle. The usual field of domestic and export buyers were present.  A number of local and Southern Tablelands restocker orders were also present.  There was an increased quantity of well-presented cattle off supplementary feed and crop that were suitable for the processors and feedlots. Well-bred secondary lines of cattle were offered for competition from the feeders and restockers. There was increased competition on yearlings from feedlot orders, with intense bidding against the processors occurring on the better lines.

Vealer steers and heifers to suit the trade were in limited numbers. Calves less than 200kg traded between 311c to 325c, up 27c/kg and prices were predominately driven by restockers. The vealer steers to the trade were well presented, trading between 311c to 358c, up 4c/kg. Vealer heifers traded between 283c to 349c/kg, with pricing steady on the previous week. Yearling steers purchased by the trade, were up 18c, ranging between 318c to 349c/kg. Feedlot buyers lifted their sights, purchasing yearlings between 265c to 339c, this was up 28c on the lighter grades, to 11c/kg dearer on the heavier cattle. Restockers also operated strongly on the secondary lines, with prices jumping up to 30c/kg on previous week. Steers returning to the paddock made between 259c to 335c/kg. Better quality yearling heifers were again well sought after by the trade and sold from 267c to 342c, up 16c to 31c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed were 20c dearer, selling from 249c to 320c/kg. Restockers purchased the balance of the heifers between 223c to 259c/kg, with prices reflecting quality.

There was only a small offering of grown steers and bullocks, however quality was good. Prices lifted 30c from last week, selling between 262c to 334c, to average 309c/kg. Heavy grown heifers were also in limited supply, and the quality was mixed.  Heavy heifers traded up 12c, selling between 226c to 299c, to average 279c/kg.  There was a good yarding of cows offered for competition. Heavy cows weighing over 520kg were up to 7c dearer on last weekâ€™s sale, trading between 220c to 270c/kg. Lighter cows, weighing below 520kg, sold between 190c to 227c, firming 2c/kg. Bulls were in limited numbers and traded down 10c, selling to an average of 249.5c/kg."
"Numbers were down 100 for a total yarding of 1,240 head. Quality was fair to good. The yarding consisted of a smaller penning of vealers, a large percentage were yearling cattle and there was some good lines of export steers.

All usual buyers were in attendance with the addition of two new restocker buyers from out of the region. Cow numbers were firm with a limited supply of bulls. Young calves under 80kg were much cheaper, with prices dropping up to 35c/kg. The limited number of lighter vealer steers were 13c easier selling from 300c to 409c to restockers and the heavier 280-330kgs averaged 348c/kg. Vealer heifers were 1c easier selling from 296c to 359c/kg. Yearling steers to feed in the 330-400kg range were 23c/kg cheaper. Yearling heifers were also cheaper and selling from 275c to 355c/kg.

There were some large lines of well finished grown steers to the processors reaching up to 306c/kg and limited supply of grown heifers. Plain light weight D2 cows were firm selling from 191c to 230c/kg. Heavy D4 cows sold up to 222c, while the best heavy weight bull sold to 264c/kg."
"Numbers were consistent, in what was on average a good quality penning of cattle.  Export cattle were well represented, along with suitable lines of secondary cattle to suit the feeders and restockers, however prime trade cattle were in short supply.   All of the usual domestic and export buyers were present, and operating, along with local and tablelands restocker orders.  An extra feeder order from the North also purchased.   Feedlotters and restockers were again subdued in their bidding, supporting the better quality pens of cattle.  The small volume of prime trade cattle met with strong competition early, however buying interest ebbed through the course of the sale

Vealers sold to both the trade and restockers from 270c-340c/kg.  Yearling steers in prime condition sold to the processors between 300c-331c/kg, with the market lifting from 3c for the medium weights on last sale.  Feeder steers again sold to a mixed trend, trading between 286-316c/kg.  Restocker lines of steers ranged between 271c-367c, with prices jumping 23c for the lighter cattle and easing 15c/kg for the medium weights.  Yearling heifers in prime condition were sought after by the trade, and sold from 276c-331c, with prices lifting 9c on the medium weights and a further 1c/kg on the heavier grade.   Yearling Heifers to the feeder order also met with some strong buying competition, with prices ranging from 260c-313c/kg.  Heifers returning to the paddock sold between 244c-309c/kg

Heavy Steers and Bullocks traded between 255c-295c, to average 277c, lifting 6c to 15c/kg.  Heavy grown Heifers sold between 230c-285c, lifting 6c, to average 263c/kg liveweight.   Heavy cows, weighing over 520kg, sold between 195c-240c/kg, with the market easing 12c for the leaner grade and 3c for the better covered cows.  Lighter cows, weighing below 520kg, sold between 194c-216c/kg, back 8c.  Heavy Bulls sold between 230c-270c, slipping 12c/kg."
"Numbers were consistent, in what was an average quality yarding of cattle across all grades.  Cow numbers declined, as did the other grades of export cattle, again there was a greater percentage of the yarding in prime condition.  Prime vealers and yearlings off supplementary feed to suit the domestic processors were well supplied, and buyers lifted their sights and secured more supply than last week.  Again the volume and number of sizable lines of quality bred secondary cattle was reduced.  Restocker competition from outside of the local area, again set the market pace, with record prices per kg being achieved on the lighter grade steers and heifers returning to the paddock.

Prime vealers sold to the trade from 365c to 399.2c, with the market lifting 8c to 23c/kg. Trade yearling steers sold from 347c to 394c, lifting 19c/kg in the medium weights, processors struggled in the 400kg to 500kg grade to secure supply.  Feeder steers again sold to slightly less aggressive buyer competition, with bidding ranging between 346c to 384c, lifting 4c on the light grade, and 7c on medium weights, however easing 10c/kg on the heavier grade cattle.  Restocker yearling and vealer steers sold between 355c to 434c, with prices jumping 31c/kg on the lighter weight weaned cattle.  Prime yearling heifers to the trade sold from 320c to 385c, with prices jumping 21c on the medium weights and 13c to 23c/kg on the heavier grades, depending on the fat cover.  Yearling heifers to feeder orders sold to small volume, trading from 340c to 363c/kg. Yearling heifers returning to the paddock sold to continued restocker interest, trading between 360c and 391c, jumping 24c/kg on the lighter grade weaned cattle.

Heavy steers and bullocks traded between 290c to 364c, with the heavy prime portion lifting 9c/kg on last sale. The pens of heavy grown heifers sold between 225c to 330c/kg, with the majority of the cattle purchased by restockers. Heavy well covered cows weighing over 520kg sold between 243c to 275c, improving 8c/kg. Medium weight plain conditioned cows, weighing below 520kg, sold between 235c to 249c, lifting 6c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 257c and 296c, lifting 9c/kg on average."
"Numbers were consistent with the previous weekâ€™s sale and the quality of the yarding was mixed, with a good representation of cattle across all weights and grades. Grown steers and heifers suitable for export however were in short supply. The usual field of domestic and export buyers were present, along with some sizable restocking orders from the Central West of NSW and the Southern Tablelands.

Vealer steers and heifers suited to the trade were of high quality and met with strong competition from processors. The secondary lines were also keenly sought by feedlot buyers and restockers. The well-presented domestic veal steer portion traded between 310c to 344c, with the equivalent heifers selling between 288c to 336c/kg. Yearling steers sold to some heated competition, with the trade portion between 242c to 310c/kg. Feedlot buyers purchased yearlings from 242c to 305c/kg. Restockers were active on the secondary lines, buying between 240c to 289c/kg. The better quality yearling heifers were dominated by trade buyers, selling from 220c to 308c/kg.  Yearling heifers in the lighter weight grades were pushed along by the feeders, selling between 235c to 276c/kg. A run of calves sold to the trade and restockers were between 179c and 388c, averaging 267c/kg.

An average quality and small offering of grown steers and bullocks sold to both domestic and export competition.  Prices were from 230c to 323c and to averaged 282c/kg.  Heavy grown heifers lacking finish sold to easing competition, making from 170c to 280c to average 208c/kg. The better quality cows weighing over 520kg sold well, with the D3 and 4 portion trading between 185c to 255c/kg. Lighter cows traded between 190 and 220c/kg.  Heavy bulls sold to an average of 267c/kg. There was also an run of bull weaner calves, and these sold to the restockers between 242c to 251c/kg."
"Numbers were consistent and quality was mixed, compared to last week. Most of the usual gallery buyers were in attendance and operating, along with smaller numbers of restocker orders.  There was an increased volume of export cattle, which again attracted the interest of some domestic processors and one feeder order, along with a good quality run of cows that sold to increased competition. The cow market lifted 5c to 16c/kg.  Prime trade cattle were in better numbers, however the trade continued to operate on secondary lines to supplement their volume orders.  Prime vealers suitable for the processors were in smaller numbers than in recent weeks, which resulted in better prices for the well finished calves.  Overall the market lifted for trade cattle 4c to 8c, with feeder steers improving 4c/kg and the restocker cattle were generally cheaper.

Prime vealers sold to the trade from 295c to 330c, lifting 5c to 13c/kg.  Restockers operated on the secondary lines of steers from 260c to 304c, with prices back 9c/kg on last week. Secondary vealer heifers were purchased by restockers from 261c to 271c, easing 1c/kg. Yearling steers sold to the processors between 252c to 327c, with the market lifting 4c on the medium weights, and slipping 13c/kg on the heavy cattle. Feeder steers sold to an improved trend, selling between 261c to 317c, lifting 4c/kg. Restocker steers ranged between 290c to 301c, easing 4c/kg on the lighter grade.  Yearling heifers to the trade sold from 260c to 326c, with prices 8c/kg dearer on the medium weights, and no change on the heavier grade. Yearling heifers to feeder orders also sold to a mixed trend, with prices ranging from 265c to 288c, back 1c/kg on the lighter cattle.

"Numbers were back slightly, in what was mixed quality yarding of cattle, with some cattle in light store condition being offered.  The usual gallery of domestic and export buyers were present, however a southern processor order did not operate, along with a usual feedlot/export buyer.   Local and tablelands restockers operated on the secondary lines of cattle and were selective on their purchasing according to quality.  Both restockers and feeders focused their attention on lines of cattle in forward condition. Heavy grown cattle were again in small numbers and met with limited competition from the processors.  The cows penned were of reasonable quality and sold to softer demand from the buyers.

There was some very well presented calves under 200kg, that sold to the processors between 309c and 416c/kg. Processor quality veal over 200kg was in short supply and sold between 275c and 360c/kg. Yearling steers off supplementary feed and crop suitable for the processors were in smaller numbers, selling between 275c and 368c, with the market slipping 46c for the heavier weights, and easing 14c/kg for the medium weights.  Feedlot buyers purchased yearling steers between 257c and 318c, with prices slipping 9c to 20c/kg on last week.

"Numbers were back slightly, and the quality lessened compared to the previous weeks yarding. All the usual gallery buyers were in attendance along with a supplementary export order which lifted the competition in the heavy steers. For the second consecutive week local restockers failed to operate with confidence due to the dry seasonal conditions across the region. Cattle in prime condition to suit the trade were in fewer numbers, however Prime Vealers to suit the processors were well supplied. Quality lines of secondary cattle suitable for the feeders and restockers were in good numbers, with the feeder orders taking home the majority of the pens.The heavy export cattle were of reasonable quality considering the size of the yarding and sold to a solid trend in the heavy steers, however the cows on the whole lacked quality and finish, which showed in decreased buyer competition.

Vealers sold to both the trade and restockers from 281c to 335c/kg. Yearling steers in prime condition sold to the processors between 280c to 332c/kg, with the market steady on the medium and heavy weights. Feeder steers sold to an easier trend, ranging between 270c to 322c/kg, with prices declining 6c for the medium weights. Restocker steers ranged between 290c to 326c, slipping 15c in the lighter grade and improving 2c/kg in the medium weights.

Heifers returning to the paddock sold between 275c to 306c, easing 6c/kg.

Heavy Steers and Bullocks traded between 255c to 305c, jumping 8c/kg for the prime cattle. Heavy grown Heifers sold between 229c to 294c, slipping 4c/kg, predominately due to quality. Heavy cows weighing over 520kg sold between 190c to 226c, with the better covered cows easing 2c/kg. Lighter cows, weighing below 520kg, sold between 180c to 205c, also back 11c/kg. Heavy Bulls sold between 200c and 258c, down 22c/kg."
"Numbers were back slightly for a good quality offering. Vealers were well supplied and there was a very good run of supplementary feed crop finished yearlings. Weaner steers and heifers were not in the numbers of the previous weeks. Grown steers were much better supplied and finished and there were around 110 good quality cows were offered. There were a few extra buyers operating but the market trend was cheaper on most lines.

Restocking steer vealers reached 415c and the best of the veal to the trade was firm ranging from 365c to 399.2c/kg. Medium weight feeder and restocking steers were 15c/kg cheaper while heifers were similar to the previous week. Steers sold from 318c to 356c and heifers from 280c to 361c averaging 344c/kg. Trade heifers eased 2c while the excellent run of steers went against the trend lifting 15c to 18c/kg on the high dressing steers. Trade cattle sold from 321c to 368c/kg.

Grown steers lifted 7c due to a much better quality and sold from 280c to 310c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows received 213c to 227c and the heavy weights 228c to 244c with a single C muscle to 257c/kg. Cows eased 8c to 14c/kg."
"Numbers were back significantly, in what was a very plain quality yarding of cattle, with large numbers of older cattle presenting in store condition.  Not all domestic and export buyers were present, with two major feedlot orders missing.  The domestic trade and local restockers purchased cattle that would have normally gone to feed.  Local and tablelands restockers competed strongly on the better bred cattle in store condition.  The run of cows penned were of reasonable quality and sold to increased buyer competition.

There was some very well presented calves under 200kg, that sold from 300c to 337c, lifting 3c/kg. Yearling steers off supplementary feed and crop suitable for the processors were in smaller numbers selling between 245c to 304c, with the market firming 7c/kg.

Yearling heifers in prime condition were reduced in offering, and sold from 250c to 339c, with prices lifting 19c on the medium weights and 10c/kg on the heavier weights.  Yearling heifers to feed, sold to a steady trend, with prices ranging from 219c to 249c/kg. 

Heavy steers and bullocks sold between 213c to 277c, to average 254.8c, up 5c/kg.  Heavy grown heifers traded between 245c to 260c, to average 254.6c/kg. Heavy cows weighing over 520kg traded between 185c to 216c/kg. Lighter cows, weighing below 520kg, sold between 173c to 205c, with prices firming 30c, 13c and 9c/kg, respectively.  Heavy bulls traded between 260c to 295c, lifting 3c/kg."
"Numbers were back significantly, however the quality was consistent to slightly better on last sale. All the usual gallery buyers were in attendance and operating, with local restockers continuing their conservative approach as seen over the past few weeks. Cattle in prime condition to suit the trade were in good numbers, which saw trade buyers compete solidly, lifting the market 3c to 8c/kg. Prime Vealers to suit the processors were also well supplied, with the trade also operating on secondary lines of veal, which would normally have attracted greater restocker interest. Quality lines of secondary yearlings, suitable for the feeders and restockers were in smaller lines, with the feeder orders taking home the majority of the pens.mThere was only a small run of export cattle yarded, with the quality of the heavy steers back on last week, which was reflected in the price.

Vealers sold to both the trade and restockers from 282c to 343c, up 6c/kg. Yearling steers in prime condition sold to the processors between 285c to 340c/kg, with the market up 6c on the medium weights. Feeder steers sold to a steady trend, trading between 278c to 325c/kg. Restocker steers ranged between 274c to 335c, improving 5c/kg in the medium weights. Yearling heifers in prime condition sold from 280c to 317c, with prices 3c/kg dearer on the medium weights.Well finished better shaped heifers attracted more attention from the processor which lifted prices 9c/kg. Yearling Heifers to the feeder orders sold to a softer trend, with prices ranging from 269c to 295c, easing 4c/kg for the medium weights. Heifers returning to the paddock sold between 270c to 285c, slipping 10c/kg.

Heavy Steers and Bullocks traded between 263c to 305c, back 2c/kg for the prime cattle.  Heavy grown Heifers sold between 245c to 288c, lifting 9c/kg, predominately due to quality. Cows also sold to a dearer trend with light cows improving 3c and heavy well covered cows lifting 8c/kg. Heavy cows weighing over 520kg sold between 203c to 228c, with the better covered cows jumping 8c/kg. Lighter cows, weighing below 520kg, sold between 180c to 214c, also lifting 3c/kg. Heavy Bulls sold between 246c and 250c, down 4c/kg."
"Numbers were back moderately, in what was a plainer quality yarding of cattle compared to the week before.  Not all domestic and export buyers were present, with southern processors and a feedlot order absent. The domestic trade orders were also very selective according to quality which saw the market sell to a much cheaper trend.  Local and tablelands restockers operated very selectively secondary lines of cattle, with bidding supporting the better bred cattle. Feeder order volumes were also reduced, due to buyer absences. The run of cows penned were of reasonable quality and sold to easier buyer competition.

There was some very well presented calves under 200kg that sold to a cheaper trend from 241c to 323c, falling 66c/kg.

"Numbers were back and the quality was good. There were mostly young weaners that either went onto feed or back to the paddock. A very good run of yearling steers that went to feed were also penned while trade cattle were fewer. There were only limited numbers of grown steers and heifers and around 100 cows were penned. The market sold to firm to cheaper trends with the exception of the yearling feeder steers which were quality driven and lifted 30c to 40c on the previous sale.
 
Restocking weaner steers were firm to slightly cheaper ranging from 270c to 371c/kg on the medium and heavy weights. Weaner heifers were cheaper with soft competition and sold from 170c to 280c/kg.

"Numbers were again consistent with the previous week for a mixed quality penning of cattle. Export cattle and prime trade cattle were well represented, along with suitable lines of secondary cattle to suit the feeders and restockers. All of the usual domestic and export buyers were present and operating, along with local and tablelands restockers and a Queensland order. Lot feeders and restockers maintained a conservative approach despite good falls of rain across the market catchment. Competition on prime trade cattle was more robust than the previous sale.

Veal calves to the processors attracted more buyer interest, selling from 241c to 371c/kg. Heavier vealers sold to both the trade and restockers from 288c to 341c/kg. Yearling steers in prime condition sold to the processors between 279c to 338c, with the market easing from 3c to 5c/kg on last sale. Feeder steers again sold to a mixed trend, trading between 265c to 310c, with prices easing by 9c/kg.

Heavy bulls sold between 240c and 255c, slipping 13c/kg."
"Numbers slipped and the quality was good with plenty of young cattle grain or crop finished. There was also a good run of fresh vealers which sold to the trade. Feeder orders were not as active on the reduced number of secondary cattle. There was a very limited supply of grown cattle and the 75 cows were mostly medium weight 2 scores.

Heavy trade vealers eased 25c/kg despite the numbers and quality. Prices ranged from 350c to 407c/kg. Light restocking steers lost 20c on average after reaching 479c/kg for Angus steers just over 200kg.

"Numbers rose from the previous week, in what was a comparable quality yarding of cattle to the previous sale. The usual gallery of domestic and export buyers were present, along with a new export cow order from a northern processor.  For the third consecutive week a major feedlot order did not operate. Local and tablelands restocker orders had fewer lines of secondary cattle to select from. Cattle off supplementary feed and crop suitable for the processors were well supplied.  Processor quality veal however was in very short supply. Heavy grown cattle were also in limited numbers, although there was a larger run of well-presented cows offered for competition.

There was a run of calves under 200kg suitable for the processors which sold between 280c to 390c/kg. Yearling steers purchased by the processors sold between 278c to 359c, with the market slipping 16c for the heavier weights, and easing 8c/kg for the medium weights.

"Numbers rose from the previous week, in what was a better quality yarding of cattle. The usual field of domestic and export buyers were present, although a major feedlot order did not operate for the second week running. Local restocker orders competed strongly on the secondary lines of cattle, lifting prices. Cattle off supplementary feed and crop suitable for the processors were well supplied.  Processor quality veal was also in greater numbers. Heavy grown cattle numbers and quality also improved from the previous week.\

There was a run of calves under 200kg suitable for the processors which sold between 270c to 403c/kg. The vealer steers and heifers to the trade were well presented and sold between 269c and 381c/kg.

Heavy grown heifers sold from 245c to 284c, to average 257.5c/kg. There was a solid yarding of well-presented cows offered for competition.

"Numbers remained the same for a total yarding of 810 plainer quality cattle. There was over 200 cows, 50 bobby calves, some good lines of grain assisted trade yearlings and over half the offering was made up of plainer, secondary type cattle. The trade market was firm, cows sold to a much cheaper trend and the limited demand from restockers saw this market also selling to a much cheaper trend. 

The limited number of vealers sold from 294c to 317c/kg. There was no change for the middle weight yearling trade steers ranging from 275c to 346c and the heavy weight yearling steers were up to 9c dearer to average 286c/kg.

"Numbers lifted, in what was a mixed quality yarding of cattle, with trade and feeder cattle well supplied.  All domestic and export buyers were present, with a return of major feedlot order, and an extra QLD export processor competed, who set the pace in the cow market.  Local and tableland restocker orders operated with greater confidence, lifting prices on the secondary lines of stock. The run of export cattle penned were of reasonable quality and sold to heavy buyer competition.

"Numbers lifted, contributed by not having a sale last week and the quality was mostly good. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering, including some excellent runs of ideal feeders along with some well finished yearling heifers to suit the trade, and plenty of weaners, returning to the paddock.

"Numbers lifted, compared to the sale before Australia Day, two weeks ago, and the quality was mixed. Yearlings made up over half of the offering, with the majority suiting feeder orders and restockers, with a few well finished pens to suit the processors.  There were a few good lines of weaners, although most were lacking the quality of previous sales, an increased number of grown cattle and 57 cows. All the usual buyers were operating.

"Numbers lifted slightly for a total yarding of 776 head of fair to good quality cattle. The bulk of the offering was made up of vealers and yearlings, with a few good lines of grown steers and 130 cows. All buyers were in attendance, with some additional restocker interest selling to a dearer trend.
 
Vealer steers to restockers were 18c dearer, selling from 378c to 444c/kg and slightly easier to processors to average 350c/kg.

"Numbers lifted moderately, in what was a better quality yarding of cattle, with all categories well supplied. All domestic and export buyers were present, along with an additional processor order from northern NSW. Not all buyer orders operated this week however. Local and Tableland restocker orders also operated strongly against the feeder orders on the secondary lines of stock. The run of export cattle were well supplied and of improved quality, and sold to strong buyer competition.

"Numbers lifted in what was a mixed quality yarding of cattle, with a number of consignments from the tablelands being yarded. Prime trade cattle were in smaller numbers, and domestic buyers had to compete strongly against feeders and restockers to secure orders. Secondary lines of well-bred cattle suitable for feeder and restocker orders were in good runs, and were wintered affected. Grown cattle declined in quality from last week, with a large percentage of the yarding having in excess of four teeth. Feeder orders again operated on the lighter conditioned four tooth cattle. The cow yarding was mixed, with the well-presented cows again being heavily contested, there were also a large number of light conditioned cows that failed to attract the same buyer interest from the processors. The medium weight plainer conditioned cows also sold to a dearer trend. All of the usual gallery buyers were in attendance, with competition from feeder orders and restockers, setting the pace in the yearling and vealer categories.

Restocker steers ranged between 307c to 407c, prices jumping 48c/kg on the lighter weight weaned cattle. Prime yearling heifers to the trade sold from 310c to 359c, with prices easing 3c on both the medium weights and 11c/kg on the heavy grades, mainly as a result of feeder competition and a reduction in quality. Yearling heifers to the feeder orders were in high demand, trading from 300c to 342c, with prices lifting 16c on the medium weight cattle and 15c/kg on the weaned lighter cattle. Yearling heifers returning to the paddock sold to larger volume between 310c and 330c, pushing 20c/kg higher on the lighter cattle.

Heavy bulls sold from 245c and 285c, up 3c/kg on last week."
"Numbers lifted in a good quality yarding. Trade cattle were well supplied and showing plenty of condition. There was a good run of feeder cattle and some very good vealers which suited the butchers. Around 220 cows were penned and  a small offering of grown steers. The market sold to a dearer trend on the trade cattle but lost ground on the cows.

Vealers sold from 265c to 337c to butchers and Restockers paid from 150c to 309c for the lighter weaners, gaining 20c/kg on some lines. Feeder steers were 3c to 5c stronger, making from 230c to 299c/kg. Feeder heifers were 8c cheaper, making from 230c to 259c/kg.

"Numbers lifted and the quality was a bit plainer. There was a good run of trade cattle and a few very good vealers but there were more secondary cattle that were lacking finish. Feedlots were more selective in the larger yarding and restocking orders were active on the plainer lines. Prime grown cattle were very limited and close to 250 plainer and lighter cows were offered. The market sold to a cheaper trend.

The heavier butcher vealers sold 20c cheaper selling from 250c to 275c/kg. Light vealer steers to restockers reached 281c/kg. Medium and heavy feeder steers eased 11c, ranging from 240c to 286c/kg.

Restocking steers and heifers were similar and steers sold from 270c to 326c/kg. Heifers sold from 253c to 338c/kg. Heavy trade vealers lifted 30c and sold from 316c to 362c/kg.

The few grown steers ranged from 276c to 290c/kg. Cows gained 20c with the medium weight 2 scores making from 162c to 194c and the heavy 3 and 4 scores making from 198c to 210c to average 203c/kg."
"Numbers lifted and the quality improved with a better run of medium and heavy weight vealers. Yearlings also improved in quality and despite a feeder order missing most went to feeder orders. Restocking activity was not as strong. Grown steers and bullocks still remain in limited numbers and cow numbers remain small with only 70 head penned. The market was cheaper across all grades.

Vealers returning to the paddock lost 20c/kg on most, while a run of weaned Angus steers sold slightly dearer. Most ranged from 385c to 455c/kg. Heavy trade vealer reached 400c/kg.

"Numbers lifted and quality remained mixed, with the bulk of the younger cattle selling to lot feeder and restocker competition. Grown steers and heifers were limited in supply, with a fair selection of cows presented for market. Restocker and lot feeder competition was solid, with strong quality and breed related price rises recorded for the vealer steers.

The over 200kg vealer steers to the restockers ranged from 354c to 454c/kg, depending on breed and quality. The same weight heifer portion also to restocker orders made from 318c to 385c/kg.

"Numbers lifted again in what was an improved quality yarding of cattle across most grades. There was however pens of light winter affected cows, grown cattle and yearling offered for sale.  Compared to last sale, the volume of quality bred secondary cattle improved, which attracted greater restocker and feeder competition. Grown cattle eased in finish from last week, with a large percentage of the yarding presenting in store condition.

There were an increased number of agents representing restockers from the Central West, Riverina, Liverpool Plains and Southern Tablelands competing in what was a dearer market. There was a good supply of cattle finished fodder crops that were suitable for the processors and feedlot and competition on the better lines was strong. Large volume restocker and feedlot orders dominated the bidding on the secondary lines of cattle, this was especially the case with heifers.

Vealer steers and heifers to suit the trade were in smaller numbers than the previous sale, however what was offered was well presented.  There was a smaller run of calves less than 200kg that were in suitable condition for the processors, which sold between 215c to 389c/kg.

Yearling heifers in the lighter weight grades were supported by the feeders and restocker orders, selling between 260c to 297c which was a jump in price from between 14c to 27c/kg.

A mixed quality offering of grown steers and bullocks sold to both domestic and export competition.  Prices traded between 230c to 314c, to average 291c/kg. The heavier steers and bullocks were up 15c/kg on the previous week. Heavy grown heifers were in short supply and the quality was mixed, and traded between 220c to 298c, up 9c to average 253c/kg.

"Numbers increased slightly, in what was a better quality yarding of cattle overall in comparison to the previous weekâ€™s sale.  The usual domestic and export buyers were present, with one processor order absent from the previous week.  There were also agents present from the Central West, Riverina and Southern Tablelands operating on behalf of restockers, in what was a dearer market.  There was an increased supply of supplementary feed cattle suitable for the processors, and competition on the better finished lines was robust.  Restocker and feeder orders underpinned the prices on the well-bred secondary lines of cattle.

There was a small run of calves under 200kg suitable for processors and these sold between 301c and 350c/kg.

"Numbers increased significantly, for a total yarding of 1226, fair to good quality cattle. There were some outstanding runs of high yielding yearlings to suit the trade, along with some excellent lines of feeder steers. Heavy grown cattle lacked the quality of previous sales, there were several pens of well-bred weaners returning to the paddock and an increased number of cows. All the usual buyers were operating, selling to a cheaper trend. 

Prime vealers reached 404c/kg. Trade yearling steers were back 10c, making from 272c to 398c/kg, for high yielding European types.

"Numbers increased in what was a plainer quality penning of cattle to last week. Cattle in prime condition to suit the trade were of mixed quality, with good lines of secondary cattle suitable for the feeders and restockers in smaller numbers. All of the usual domestic and export buyers were present, and operating, however restockers were subdued in their bidding aggression compared to last sale. There was a large yarding of grown cattle and robust competition in the export categories helped an increase in prices.  Trade buyers had more opportunity to buy yearling cattle, with reduced competition from the feeders and restockers on the prime pens.

Veal calves were in short supply, trading from 270c to 435c/kg.  Heavier vealers were however well supplied, and sold to both the trade and restockers from 285c to 380c, trending 4c/kg higher.

"Numbers increased in both the trade and export runs. Quality was mixed, with a fair percentage of the young cattle lacking finish. There was a small and good number of ideal trade vealers but most of the yearlings were purchased by restockers or lot feeders. Grown steers remained similar and around 130 cows were penned for the usual buyers.

"Numbers increased and the quality was good. There were some good runs of well finished yearling steers to suit the trade and light weight weaners to restockers attracted a lot of attention, with steers under 200kg reaching 519c/kg. There was not as strong a demand for feeder cattle and grown cattle were in limited supply. Most of the regular buyers were operating.

"Numbers increased and the quality was again mixed. There was some good runs of supplementary fed yearling heifers to suit the trade, an increased number of cows, some well bred weaners to suit restockers and several lines of secondary weaners and yearlings.

Grown cattle were cheaper, with other categories mostly firm to a slightly dearer trend. 

Medium weight yearling steers to suit the trade were cheaper and those over 400kg were a few cents better, selling from 530c to 590c/kg.

"Numbers increased and the quality improved on the heavy trade veal, but remained mixed in all other categories. Heavy trade vealers were well supplied, while lighter weights and weaners were in good numbers and keenly sought after by Restockers. Most of the yearlings were purchased by feeder orders. Grown steers and bullocks were fewer in numbers and plainer in quality, and cow numbers were back. All the usual buyers operated along with an extra export order.

Heavy vealers to the trade sold 5c to 7c cheaper, with the best of the steers reaching 337c/kg. Restocking lines and light weaners were up 20c, with most selling between 270c and 321c/kg. The feeder steers remained steady selling from 280c to 315c/kg. The majority of heifers to feed lifted 2c, receiving 281c to 308c/kg. Trade steers gained 8c to 10c, with the bulk ranging from 292c to 314c/kg. Heifers lifted 2c selling from 285c to 309c/kg.

Medium weight 2 score cows sold from 166c to 211c/kg, with the heavy weights making from 202c to 216c/kg to average 210c/kg. The best of the heavy bulls reached 276c/kg."
"Numbers increased and the good season has contributed to the continued improved quality. Cow numbers declined, causing prices to jump and there was a limited supply of grown heifers and steers. Yearlings were well supplied, attracting strong competition from feeder orders and there were some good runs of well bred weaners to suit restockers. All usual buyers, along with an additional buyer from the Central West, were operating, creating a lift in prices for most categories. 

Prime vealers were dearer, quality related, selling from 350c to 432c/kg. Trade steers were firm to 7c cheaper, making from 345c to 437c/kg and yearling heifers to processors were variable. Ideal feeder steers reached 434c and the heifer portion averaged 379c/kg. Well bred 200-280kg weaner steers going to restockers, attracted strong competition from many buyers, with the bulk making from  410c to 489c and the same weight heifers sold from 370c to 410c/kg.

The best grown steer reached 318c and grown heifers sold from 255c to 270c/kg to processors. The short supply and improved quality cows on offer saw prices jump by up to 15c, selling from 180c to 294c/kg. The best heavy weight bull reached 330c/kg."
"Numbers increased after last weekâ€™s disruption, for a total yarding of 466, mostly good quality cattle. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering, including some outstanding yearling steers and heifers to suit the trade, along with some ideal feeder steers. There were some good runs of weaners and yearlings returning to the paddock and 63 mostly prime heavy cows. All the usual buyers were operating, with the addition of extra restocker buyers, competed in a very strong market.

Prime vealers topped at 600c/kg. Trade yearling steers were up to 11c dearer, making from 510c to 608c/kg. Yearling heifers to process lifted 7c, selling from 486c to 595c/kg. Feeder steers were a few cents better, 500c to 610c and the heifers to feed were also dearer to average 510c/kg. Yearlings attracted strong competition from restockers, with the steers selling from 550c to 622c and the heifer portion making from 518c to 670c/kg. Light weight weaner steers topped at 985c and those over 200kg averaged 739c/kg.  Weaner heifers ranged from 550c to 640c/kg.

"Numbers fell this week for a total yarding of 726 head of fair to good quality cattle. The bulk of the yarding was made up of vealers and yearlings, with a few good lines of well finished grown steers and over 60 cows. All the usual buyers were in attendance selling to a variable market. 

Light weight vealer steers to restockers were up 14c selling from 399c to 419c, while the medium weights were slightly easier to the processors to average 362c/kg. There was keen demand for light weight vealer heifers from both processors and restockers up to 20c dearer to top at 398c/kg. Yearling steers to feeder orders sold from 280c to 348c/kg, slightly dearer for the light weights and cheaper for the heavier weights. Yearling heifers to the processors were much cheaper overall, ranging from 250c to 396c/kg, a reflection on the quality. Demand from feeder orders and restockers was also easier selling from 260c to 346c/kg.

Some well finished grown steers topped at 300c/kg. There were too few lighter cows to quote and the heavier D3 cows were up 4c selling from 205c to 230c/kg. The limited number of bulls sold to a cheaper trend."
"Numbers fell slightly from the previous week, in what was a reasonable quality yarding of cattle. The usual gallery of domestic and export buyers were present, along with a return order from a major feedlot operator/processor after almost a monthâ€™s absence.  Local and tablelands restockers also competed strongly on the secondary lines of cattle. Processor quality veal was in very short supply, however yearlings off supplementary feed and crop suitable for the processors were well supplied.   Heavy grown cattle were again in limited numbers, although there was a large run of very well-presented cows offered for competition.

Calves under 200kg suitable for the processors sold between 260c and 350c/kg. Yearling steers purchased by the processors sold between 310c and 357c, with the market jumping 12c for the heavier weights and lifting 4c/kg for the medium weights.  Feedlot buyers purchased yearling steers between 270c and 341c, with the extra buying demand lifting prices 13c to 18c/kg. Restockers operated strongly on the secondary lines, with steers returning to the paddock purchased between 289c and 334c/kg. Yearling heifers in prime condition were keenly contested by the processors and sold from 291c to 357c, with prices lifting 5c to 15c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed sold to stronger demand, with prices ranging from 291c to 318c/kg. Heifers returning to the paddock sold between 273c and 300c/kg.

There was a similar sized yarding of grown steers and bullocks. Heavy steers sold between 260c and 322c, to average 297.6c/kg. Heavy grown heifers sold between 232c and 312c, lifting 30c to average 292.2c/kg. There was good yarding of well-presented cows offered for competition.  Heavy cows weighing over 520kg traded between 235c and 265c/kg. Lighter cows, weighing below 520kg, sold between 215c and 256c, with prices improving 3c to 10c/kg across most grades.  Heavy bulls traded between 302c and 318c, with prices lifting 10c/kg."
"Numbers fell significantly from the previous week, with 215mm of rain recorded at Moss Vale since Sunday.  The usual field of domestic and export buyers were present, although not all orders operated.  There were a number of restocker orders from the Central Tablelands and South West slopes that operated on the secondary lines of cattle, with reduced competition from the feedlots.  Cattle off supplementary feed and crop suitable for the processors were in limited numbers and heated competition saw the prime trade cattle sell to a much dearer trend.

There was a mixed run of calves under 200kg suitable for the processors, which sold between 215c to 358c/kg. The vealer steers and heifers to the trade were in limited numbers and sold between 285c to 366c, with prices steady to 30c/kg dearer based upon the quality presented. Yearling steers purchased by the processors sold between 297c to 364c, which eased 8c for the heavier weights and lifted 11c/kg for the medium weights. Feedlot buyers hardly operated on yearling steers and the few that were purchased sold to 315c/kg. Restockers were more active on the secondary lines, purchasing steers between 287c to 324c/kg. Yearling heifers in prime condition were again well sought after by trade and sold from 271c to 369c, which was steady to 31c/kg dearer. Yearling heifers to feed prices ranged from 285c to 308c, which were steady to 10c/kg cheaper for the small volume that sold. Restockers purchased heifers between 250c to 295c/kg, which was steady on the previous sale.

There was a small yarding of grown steers and bullocks. Heavy steers sold between 243c to 335c, to average 276c, which down up to 19c/kg. Heavy grown heifers were again in limited supply and they sold between 238c to 312c, to average 276c/kg. There was a small yarding of well-presented cows offered for competition. Heavy cows weighing over 520kg were up 8c to 18c on lasts weekâ€™s sale, trading between 231c to 259c/kg. Lighter cows, weighing below 520kg, sold between 230c to 248c, lifting 7c to 19c/kg. Heavy bulls traded back 8c, to an average of 273.9c/kg."
"Numbers fell in what was a comparable quality penning of cattle to last week. Cattle in prime condition to suit the trade were well supplied along with quality lines of secondary cattle suitable for the feeders and restockers. All of the usual domestic and export buyers were present and operating, along with a larger volume of local restocker orders from across the market catchment and Central West of NSW. Competition in the export categories again increased prices. Lot feeders and restockers again dominated in the yearling cattle, with trade buyers pushed into paying a premium for the prime lots offered.

Veal calves to the processors and restockers were in lower numbers, trading from 280c to 365c/kg.  Heavier vealers were well supplied and sold to both the trade and restockers from 300c to 370c/kg.  Yearling steers in prime condition sold to the processors between 300c and 350c, with the market lifting 7c/kg on last sale. Feeder steers sold to a positive trend, trading between 288c and 324c, prices jumping 15c for the medium weights, and lifting 13c/kg for the heavier grade. Restocker lines of steers ranged between 280c and 384c, with prices improving 6c/kg for the lighter grade cattle. Yearling heifers in prime sold from 270c to 340c, with prices improving 8c on the medium weights and jumping 14c/kg on the heavier grade. Yearling heifers to the feeder orders sold to a mixed trend, with prices ranging from 274c to 301c, improving 4c/kg, and the market held steady for the medium weights. Heifers returning to the paddock sold between 270c and 320c/kg.

Heavy steers and bullocks traded between 245c and 289c, lifting 2c/kg. Heavy grown heifers sold between 220c and 276c, trending higher by 6c/kg. Heavy cows weighing over 520kg sold between 205c to 228c, with prices easing 6c/kg lower for the better covered cows. Lighter cows, weighing below 520kg, sold between 200c and 214c, up 3c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 230c and 275c, lifting 5c/kg."
"Numbers fell by over 100 and the quality was mostly good. Yearlings made up half of the offering including some good runs to suit the trade, along with some lines of ideal feeder steers. Young cattle returning to the paddock continue to attract strong competition along with a few good pens of grown steers. The market remains very strong.

Prime vealers reached 552c/kg. Light weight vealer steers to the restockers were up to 44c dearer, selling from 669c to 828c/kg. The limited supply of vealer heifers returning to the paddock averaged 596c/kg. Yearling steers to process remained unchanged, selling from 496c to 548c/kg. Trade heifers lifted 4c making from 510c to 546c/kg. Feeder steers were a few cents easier with the medium weights averaging 565c and those over 400kg averaging 534c/kg. There were not enough feeder heifers to quote.

Heavy grown steers were back 3c, selling from 380c to 455c/kg. The limited supply of grown heifers saw prices remain unchanged sell from 365c to 436c/kg. Heavy 3 and 4 score cows were firm to 2c better, reaching 400c/kg. Heavy bulls to process lifted 7c to reach 358c/kg.

Market Reporter, David Kent."
"Numbers fell by 170 for a total yarding of 880, fair to good quality cattle. Young cattle made up a large percentage of the offering, including some outstanding runs of yearlings and vealers to suit the trade, along with some good lines of feeder steers. There were large numbers of weaners returning to the paddock, and suiting some feedlot buyers. Grown cattle were limited and there were 80 cows. An improved quality of cows sold to a dearer trend, and all other categories sold to a much cheaper market.

Prime vealers reached 428c, to average 298c/kg. There was a continued run of high yielding yearling steers to suit the trade, topping at 438c, however prices declined as the run continued, averaging 295c/kg.  Yearling heifers to process dipped 30c, selling from 180c to 400c/kg. Feeder steers were up to 40c cheaper, ranging from 224c to 350c/kg, and heifers to feed were a few cents easier, making from 200c to 250c/kg.. Weaner steers to the restockers were back 25c, selling from 100c to 328c and the heifer portion remained mostly firm, on last sales lower prices, receiving from 80c to 256c/kg.

Grown steers and heifers were in limited supply, which made it difficult to get an accurate trend. Two and three score cows to process, were 8c better, ranging from 120c to  195c, and heavy prime cows lifted 6c, selling from 185c to 231c/kg. The best heavy weight bull topped at 215c/kg.
David Kent Market Reporter"
"Numbers fell and the quality was plainer over the yarding. Prime vealers were in short supply and most of the remaining vealers and yearlings went to restocking and feeder orders. Grown steers were also plainer and in reduced numbers and only 50 cows were penned. Restockers were quieter and some feeder orders were not operating in a cheaper market.

Restocking lines fell 20c to 25c/kg with the exception of steers under 200kg. Prices ranged from 345c to 446c with most of the steers selling around 380c/kg. Trade cattle feeder steers and heifers and grown steers all eased around 20c with feeder steers receiving 317c to 369c/kg. Restocking yearling heifers sold from 240c to 351c and the trade steers and heifers ranged from 285c to 348c/kg.

Grown steers and bullocks were in reduced numbers and sold from 255c to 300c/kg. Cows were 15c to 20c cheaper with the medium weight 2 score cows selling between 200c and 228c/kg. Heavy 3 and 4 scores made between 235c and 256c averaging 243c/kg."
"Numbers fell 17% from the previous week, in what was a mixed quality yarding of cattle. There were buyers absent from the previous sale, with a feedlot order and a processor order unavailable for competition. There were again a sizable number of restocker orders from the southern tablelands, south west slopes and Riverina who competed in what was a dearer market for cattle returning to the paddock. There was a smaller quantity of well finished cattle that were suitable for the processors and feedlots. Competition on the better bred lines was strong across all buying orders. Large volume restocker and feedlot orders again dominated the bidding on the secondary lines of cattle however heifers returning to the paddock and the feedlot were cheaper when compared to the previous week.

Vealer steers and heifers to suit the trade were in short supply. There was a small run of calves under 200kg that were not in suitable condition for the processors and traded between 235c and 280c/kg.  The vealer steers selling to the trade were steady and sold between 300c and 344c, to average 332c/kg. The vealer heifer portion traded between 265c and 340c, to average 307c/kg.

Compared to last sale, the volume of quality bred secondary cattle was consistent, there was however much higher restocker and feeder competition. All of the usual gallery buyers were in attendance, with the absence of two export processors due to maintenance shutdowns.

"After two weeks break numbers declined, in what was a mixed quality yarding of cattle with all weights and grades represented.  Rainfall of 25 to 75mm fell across the catchment, which also impacted on the yarding.  All of the usual domestic and export buyers were present however a major feedlot order did not operate, along with a local domestic feeder. There was a QLD restocker order in place on heavy steers, which assisted in underpinning that grade. Prime cattle to suit the trade were in short supply, with domestic buyers opting to take some secondary cattle to fill orders.  Feedlotters and restockers were again selective on their bidding, supporting the better quality pens of cattle. The export yarding of cattle was very small, with only a handful of grown cattle and cows yarded, a number of export orders dipped into the trade pens of cattle to secure numbers.

"After good falls of rain and local paddocks awash with green feed, numbers were again consistent with the previous week. Overall it was better quality penning of cattle.
