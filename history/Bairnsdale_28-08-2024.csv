Commentary
"There were approximately 150 export and 60 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 50 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a generally firm market. Quality declined with few prime cattle penned other than a small selection of yearling heifers. The limited selection of trade cattle sold to firm demand. Manufacturing steers sold firm. A couple of grown heifers sold a little dearer. Cows sold generally firm. A couple of heavy bulls were dearer. 

A few vealers sold from 380c to 410c/kg. Yearling trade steers made between 338c and 390c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade sold between 329c and 386c/kg. Manufacturing steers made from 320c to 345c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 229c to 310c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 270c and 340c/kg. A couple of heavy bulls made 336c/kg.
