Commentary
"The last prime cattle sale before the Christmas break saw agents yard 764 head, down 152 from the previous week. Re-stocker and feedlot demand particularly from North of the border drove up prices for most yearlings and weaner heifers. Approximately 60 cows were on offer and sold strongly.
 
This week's sale featured a greater selection of steer weaners which sold for slightly cheaper prices ranging from 270c to 442c/kg. Heavier steer weaners over 330kg were much dearer selling from 350c to 412c/kg. Good supplies of weaner heifers also saw strong demand with buyers needing to fill trucking orders resulting in price surges of 20c to 33c/kg making from 282c to 338c/kg.  
 
Medium and heavy yearling steers suited for lot feeding also traded dearer up 10c to 14c/kg and sold from 300c to 384c/kg. Yearling heifers destined for the same market saw a spike of 30c/kg trading from 314c to 326c/kg.
 
Grown steers and bullocks for the export market sold from 270c to 310c/kg, while their heifer counterparts made 266c to 284c/kg. Cow prices were considerably dearer, with 2-scores making from 220c to 268c/kg and heavy prime cows up 6c/kg trading from 262c to a top of 290c/kg.
