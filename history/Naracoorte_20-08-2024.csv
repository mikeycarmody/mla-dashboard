Commentary
"Reduced yarding of just 453 cattle as supply nearly halved on a week ago. Quality also dropped away with no notable trade or heavy prime steers available. The yarding of yearlings and grown steers and heifers could really only be described as very plain. The small offering follows good rainfall across the region in the past week, and agents advised prime cattle numbers are low in the area after the sell-off earlier in the season. The regular buyers were keen today and prices were firm to dearer across the grown heifers and few heavy steers available. But the cow market was the highlight with heavy Angus females to a top of 362c/kg lwt and the majority of cows selling above 300c even as quality slipped away. Heavy cows gained a strong 10c/kg while the middle and plainer cows were 20c to 30c/kg dearer. There was a special sale of two grain fed steers sold for charity which made the top price of 480c/kg on a generous bid from a meatwork.

In a very mixed  yarding of younger cattle  yearling steers sold to 380c and the best grown steers to 370c/kg. The majority of the yarding, which included a lot of grown heifers of various breeds and shape, sold in a range of 320c to 360c/kg. Lighter and plainer store calves in odd lots mostly 260c to 310c/kg. There was a line of young Hereford bull calves which could still be marked late which made 278c to 300c/kg to restockers.
 
Competition for cows was very strong and consistent, the lead pen of heavy beef cows in fat score 4 condition from 340c to a top of 362c/kg. The leaner score 3 beef cows with weight from 335c to 358c/kg, while the lighter fat score 2 cows were considerably dearer in places at 272c to 332c/kg lwt. Overall the majority of cows sold above 300c in a stronger market.  The line up of export bulls generally lacked fat cover and varied from 220 to 295c/kg for most.
