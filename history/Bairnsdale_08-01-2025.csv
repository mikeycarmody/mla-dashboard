Commentary
"There were approximately 220 export and 80 young cattle penned representing an increase of 180 head from the final sale of 2024. The regular buying group was present and operating in a dearer market. Quality improved with more prime cattle and a smaller proportion of cows. Competition was solid for all grades with restockers keeping a floor in the young pens as export processors competed for lots with weight leading to price rises of 30c/kg for much of the sale. 

Yearling trade steers sold from 360c to 370c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade made between 330c and 360c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold between 330c and 360c/kg. Heavy grown heifers with finish made from 320c to 360c/kg. 

Manufacturing steers sold from 285c to 349c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made between 207c and 268c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly between 260c and 324c/kg. Heavy bulls made from 260c to 305c/kg.
