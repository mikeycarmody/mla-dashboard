Commentary
"Numbers were down slightly on the eve of the race that stops the nation, as 885 exports and 535 trade cattle were on hand. Not all buyers were in attendance, after last weekâ€™s very strong showing. The export quality was fair but not to the same level as the previous sale. There were fewer heavy steers and prices for the grown steers and bullocks showed an overall cheaper trend. 

The trade cattle had fewer lighter weighted cattle, with the store portion having more weight this week. There were a couple of pens of supplementary fed lots.The best of the B muscled yearling steers topped at 389c/kg for both the steer and heifer portion. The bulk of the yearling steers made from 295c to 360c/kg to average 331c/kg. The yearling heifers portion to the trade, ranged from 280c to 355c/kg with the odd sale to 389c/kg.  Feedlotters remained active over the whole yarding.

The Friesian steers made from 222c to 295c/kg. The 500 to 600kg steers ranged from 300c to 360c/kg. The 600kg plus steers made from 310c to 355c/kg. Heavy beef cows ranged from 270c to 310c/kg to average 295c/kg. The dairy cows were in limited number and made from 218c to 248c/kg."
