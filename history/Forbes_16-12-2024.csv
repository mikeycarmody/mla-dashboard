Commentary
"For the last sale of the year, numbers were back by 502 for a yarding of 941 cattle. Quality was mixed with good supplies of feeder weights on offer, along with fair supplies of heavy prime cattle. Not all the regular buyers were operating.

Prime yearling steers were up to 20c cheaper, selling from 283c to 335c, while prime yearling heifers were firm to dearer, 260c to 347c/kg. Feeder steers dropped 15c, 289c to 370c, while feeder heifers were firm to cheaper, 288c to 333c/kg. Lightweight restocker cattle were dearer, young steers sold from 310c to 395c, and heifers, 290c to 320c/kg.

Prime grown steers held firm, 300c to 335c while prime grown heifers lifted 8c, 290c to 333c/kg. Cows were 3c better, 2 and 3 scores sold from 200c to 280c, and heavy prime cows, 276c to 287c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 287c/kg.
