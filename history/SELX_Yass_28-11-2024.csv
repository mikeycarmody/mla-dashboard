Commentary
"Numbers increased for a total yarding of 898 mixed quality cattle. There were a few good pens of finished cattle suiting the processors, along with large numbers of plainer types. There were a few good runs of heavy grown cattle, and there were 180cows. All the usual buyers were operating. Finished cattle were a few cents dearer, plainer types sold to softer trends.

Yearlings to process were a few cents better, selling from 254c to 335c/kg. Feeder steers slipped 4c, making from 258c to 332c, and heifers to feed were also cheaper, averaging 270c/kg. Young cattle returning to the paddock were cheaper overall, with the steers ranging from 212c to 382c, and the heifers sold from 120c to 315c/kg.

The better quality heavy grown steers were up to 6c dearer, making from 292c to 331c, and the heifer portion lifted 5c, selling from 278c to 335c/kg. Cows were up to 3c dearer, with 2 and 3 scores ranging from 180c to 262c, and heavy prime cows sold from 268c to 292c/kg. Heavy bulls to process reached 300c/kg.
