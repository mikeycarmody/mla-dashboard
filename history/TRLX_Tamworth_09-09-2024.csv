Commentary
"Female cattle once again dominated supply in an increased penning. Young cattle and cows were well supplied along with a large supply of bulls. There were limited numbers of export cattle. The quality of the offering was very mixed however there were some good lines of quality restocker and feeder cattle penned. The condition of the offering varied greatly through all categories. There was a little extra feedlot competition while all the regular buyers were in attendance.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with the light weight restocker steers selling on a firm to slightly cheaper trend for the most part. Medium weight feeder steers sold to a dearer trend while those returning to paddocks were cheaper. The heavy weight feeder steers saw a generally firm market trend while breed and quality affected average prices. Light weight yearling heifers experienced little but breed and quality related price change. Medium and heavy weights sold to cheaper trends of 11c to 15c/kg under weaker demand and quality related change.

The small number of heavy grown steers bought by processors experienced little change. The well finished grown heifers saw trends cheaper by 10c to 20c/kg. There was an easing in the cow market with the overall quality not as good as recent weeks. The heavy weight cows saw a trend 10c to 14c cheaper with the medium weight less affected. A very strong bull market saw all weight classes sell to dearer trends."
