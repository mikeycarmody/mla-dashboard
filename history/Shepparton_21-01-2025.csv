Commentary
"There were 1440 exports of that 820 cows and 735 trade cattle were penned. The beef cows had plenty of weight and condition. There were fewer good quality grown steers about this week. Feedlotter and store buyers although still very present throughout the sale were not as fierce this week resulting in prices coming back. 

The majority of buyers were at the rails but several exporters were not operating. Overall, prices came back across all export categories, the trade cattle had mixed results. The best of the finished young cattle going to processors remained firm, while plainer young cattle were all back 10c to 30c/kg.

There were larger lines of slightly under done and Euro cross cattle yarded. The best of the vealers made to 379c/kg. The yearling steers to the trade made from 330c to 370c/kg to average 336c/kg. Feeder steers made from 300c to 350c/kg. The yearling heifers to the trade made from 280c to 360c/kg. The plainer store cattle were 6c to 30c/kg cheaper.
