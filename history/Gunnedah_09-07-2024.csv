Commentary
"Gunnedah penned 1635 mostly good quality cattle 456 less than last week. There were pens of plainer types included in the offering. The cow penning resulted in much dearer trends for that category to top at 299c/kg. There were pens of medium weight yearling steers up to 400c/kg and yearling steers in excess of 500kgs also making to 400c/kg. The regular buyers attended and included an extra cow buyer.

Weaner steers 274c to 402c/kg and the heifer portion 23c/kg dearer 294c to 325c/kg. Light steers to feed 312c to 410c/kg and backgrounders to 407c/kg. Medium feeders sold to strong trends and the heavy categories saw a moderate quality correction. Light background heifers sold to a modest rise however medium weights slipped 16c/kg plainer types affecting averages.

Grown heifers to feed were considerably dearer making to 340c/kg. The same applied to the heavy grown processor heifers which sold to very competitive demand. Cows trends improved with medium weights making to 250c/kg and heavy cows to 22c/kg dearer 260c to 299c/kg.
