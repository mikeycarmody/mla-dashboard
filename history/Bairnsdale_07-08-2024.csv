Commentary
"There were 175 export and 40 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 50 head week-on-week. There was a full field of buyers present but not all operating in a dearer market. Quality was short beyond a handful of well finished yearling trade cattle with cows again well represented. Trade cattle sold firm. Manufacturing steers lifted 15c to 30c/kg. Cows sold from 5c to 15c/kg dearer and more on some isolated sales. Heavy bulls kicked 50c/kg. 

Yearling trade steers sold from 355c to 390c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade made between 355c and 360c/kg. Manufacturing steers sold between 285c and 370c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made from 236c to 308c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly from 255c to 344c/kg. Heavy bulls made between 300c and 340c/kg.
