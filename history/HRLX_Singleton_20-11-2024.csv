Commentary
"
A modest decline of 100 head saw agents yard 674 cattle. Quality was fair but not up to last weeks excellent standard. There were fair runs of re-stocker weaner types, a few yearlings with around 55 cows penned. Most of the regular buying group were at the rail in a market that saw varied trends throughout.
 
Light weaner steers couldnâ€™t hold onto last weeks frantic pace falling 39c/kg selling from 272c to 386c/kg, medium weights lost even further ground making from 293c to 364c/kg, heavier types over 330kg averaging around 325c/kg. Light re-stocker heifer weaners 20c/kg easier trading from 260c to 302c/kg, medium weights 256c to 282c/kg whilst the best B muscle local trade calves over 330kg held firm selling from 310c to 338c/kg. 
 
Medium and heavy yearling steers all cheaper mostly selling in a range from 265c to 340c/kg. Prime yearling heifers over 400kg to the processors saw gains of 13c/kg making from 290c to 306c/kg. Similar gains for heavy grown steers over 500kg to the exporters 280c to 336c/kg.

Light Cows lost ground 180c to 264c/kg, heavy 3 and 4 scores back 4c to 14c/kg trading between 274c and 282c/kg.
