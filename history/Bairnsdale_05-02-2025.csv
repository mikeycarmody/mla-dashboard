Commentary
"There were approximately 270 export and 20 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 15 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a cheaper market in places. Quality was limited again with cows making up most of the sale and very few prime cattle penned. The sprinkling of well finished cattle sold firm while secondary and plainer lots eased. Cows sold from 5c to 20c/kg cheaper and more where quality was an issue. Heavy bulls sold firm to slightly dearer. 

Yearling steers to restockers sold from 270c to 285c/kg. A couple of yearling heifers with finish made 312c/kg. Grown steers sold between 340c and 345c/kg. Manufacturing steers made from 240c to 309c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 200c to 240c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 238c and 290c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 262c and 309c/kg.
