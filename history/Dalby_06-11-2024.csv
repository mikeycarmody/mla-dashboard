Commentary
"The number of cattle penned at Dalby increased by 1,782 head to 5,943. Once again this week there was another large run of 642 head from one vendor in New South Wales. Large numbers of heavy bullocks continued to come forward. A fair panel of buyers covering all classes was present and active however the southern export processors were absent.

Young cattle varied in price according to the quality penned however most were firm to slightly better. Despite the large supply all classes of bullocks experienced strong competition. Cows were firm to 3c to 4c/kg better.

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock made to 440c with most sales from 383c to 386c/kg. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market made to 395c to average from 361c to 381c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed averaged 356c with a few pens to 374c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers made to 334c with most from 292c to 310c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed made to 344c to average from 310c to 315c/kg. Heavy weight yearling heifers to feed averaged 312c with sales to 342c/kg.

Heavy grown steers to export processors averaged 341c and sold to 344c/kg. Bullocks made to 344c to average 339/kg. A large run of full mouth bullocks made to 330c to average 311c/kg some returning $2,389/head.   Medium weight 2 score cows averaged 250c and made to 266c/kg. Heavy weight 3 score cows averaged 275c and the best of the cows made to 295c to average 287c/kg. Heavy weight bulls made to 315c/kg.
