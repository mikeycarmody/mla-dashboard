Commentary
"Inverell penned 1279 mixed cattle with not all regular buyers attending. Trends varied through the sale according to quality.

Steer weaners slipped 13c/kg to restockers as did the heifer drafts although a lack of quality forced the issue selling to a 24c/kg deficit 192c to 286c/kg. Light yearling steers to background sold to 13c/kg dearer however medium feeders were up to 16c/kg cheaper making to 372c/kg. A negative correction for light feeder heifers resulted in that category losing 15c/kg.  Medium feeders on the other hand sold to 15c/kg better ranging 288c to 344c/kg.

Limited grown steers were firm to slightly dearer and the heifer drafts rose 20c/kg to sell up to 262c/kg. Cows were firm to  marginally dearer heavy drafts 209c to 235c/kg. Medium cows 24c/kg better and cows back to the paddock 210c to 216c/kg.
