Commentary
"There was a sharp drop in the overall numbers with cows making up a large percentage. Young cattle were also well supplied however export weight grown steers and heifers were scarce. The quality of the offering was fair to good while condition varied. Not all the regular feedlot and restockers were in attendance while not all processors operated.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with weaners to restockers selling to dearer trends, odd pens of steers showing strong gains. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed also sold to dearer trends with some quality related price change. Heavy feeder steers sold to a dearer trend with the preferred lines improving by 4c/kg. Yearlings heifers to restock and feed sold on a firm to dearer 
 trend for the most part. The leaner medium weights were cheaper with breed and quality contributing. Once again the preferred lines experienced the best of prices.

An improved quality penning of heavy grown steers to process were considerably dearer while the well finished grown heifers to process sold to a cheaper trend. A large percentage of the cows presented in store condition and were keenly sought by fatteners with the trend dearer. The quality and breed of the cows contributed to strong gains. Processor demand was weaker with cheaper trends resulting in all classes."
