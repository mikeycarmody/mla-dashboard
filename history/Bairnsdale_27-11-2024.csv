Commentary
"There were approximately 210 export and 40 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 40 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a cheaper market in places. Quality was again limited with cows representing over half of the sale. A handful of trade steers sold firm while heifers eased 20c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold firm. Light and medium weight cows sold to stronger demand from restockers while heavy beef cows eased 5c to 13c/kg. Heavy bulls slipped 30c/kg. 

Yearling trade steers sold from 321c to 340c/kg. Yearling heifers suited to the trade made between 270c and 290c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold between 320c and 322c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made from 189c to 242c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly from 190c to 276c/kg. Heavy bulls made between 220c and 267c/kg.
