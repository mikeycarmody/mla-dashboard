Commentary
"It was a significantly larger yarding, driven by last weekâ€™s surge in prices. The quality of cattle presented was mixed, particularly among those weighing under 500kg, most presented with considerable frame, potential for buyers looking to capitalize on good weight gains. However, well-finished cattle were notably in short supply. Despite the increased numbers at the sale, not all buyers operated at full capacity, leading to varied participation levels across the board. This influx of cattle resulted in a decline in prices for secondary steers, with price drops of  of 20-30c/kg common, while the heifer portion met solid support.
 
Feeder cattle dominated the yarding, although the ranks of restockers were less robust compared to the previous week. Light-weight feeder steers were well-supplied, but buyer caution led to a price dip of 30c, selling between 331-375c/kg. Medium-weight feeder steers also experienced a downward trend, with prices falling by 20c to range from 332-400c/kg. Meanwhile, light-weight steers returning to the paddock saw a significant price reduction of 44c  fetching between 345-427c/kg. In contrast, feeder heifer prices remained strong, with buyers showing keen interest across all categories. Medium-weight heifers sold well, ranging from 310-374c/kg. However, the trade run of cattle suitable for domestic processors was limited, with trade steers and heifers selling between 315-364c/kg.
 
On the export front, heavy steers was limited, with prices ranging from 320-370c/kg. Notably, the quality of bullocks improved this week, resulting in a price lift of 31c, with the bulk selling between 326-390c/kg. Heavy cows were well-supplied, attracting a large field of buyers eager to secure their share of the market. Price gains of 10-13c were common, with heavy cows selling from 296 -321c/kg. The D2 and D3 grades of cows sold from 255-315c/kg"
