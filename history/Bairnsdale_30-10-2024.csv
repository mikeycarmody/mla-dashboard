Commentary
"There were approximately 250 export and 30 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 25 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a dearer market. Quality declined with very few prime lots and a larger proportion of cows. The young cattle lacked finish and restockers kept the floor up paying a little more than the previous sale. Manufacturing steers improved slightly. Cows sold 10c to 15c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls lifted 10c/kg. 

Yearling steers reached a top of 324c while the heifer portion reached 314c/kg. Manufacturing steers sold from 260c to 330c/kg. A few grown heifers with some finish made 316c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold between 176c and 257c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly from 248c to 295c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 296c to 322c/kg. 

Market reporter: Brendan Fletcher."
