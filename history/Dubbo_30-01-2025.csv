Total Yarding: 3060 (-2330)
Commentary
"With the very hot conditions during the week combined with the cheaper markets numbers were back considerably with a yarding of 3060. It was a much plainer quality yarding with the bulk of the numbers coming in from the far west. A number of the cattle are showing the effects of the very dry conditions being experienced in the west.
 
Young cattle to the trade were close to firm with prime vealers and yearlings selling from 250c to 330c/kg. Feeder steers were 4c dearer while the feeder heifers though were 9c/kg cheaper. Feeder steers sold from 310c to 388c while the feeder heifers sold from 255c to 350c/kg. Young cattle to the restockers were cheaper with quality a factor. The young steers sold to 426c while the young heifers sold to 368c/kg.
 
Grown steers were 10c cheaper, the grown heifers though were 6c/kg dearer. Prime grown steers sold from 270c to 354c while the prime grown heifers sold from 280c to 324c/kg. Secondary cows finished 1c to 3c dearer while the properly finished heavy weights were 8c/kg cheaper. The 2 and 3 score cows to the processors sold from 233c to 275c/kg. Prime heavy weight cows sold from 268c to 299c/kg. The restockers paid 170c for cows to fatten and 254c/kg for cows to breed on with. Bulls were cheaper selling to 301c/kg.
