Commentary
"There were approximately 430 export and 100 young cattle penned representing an increase of 230 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a cheaper market. Quality was mixed with some good trade cattle and some well finished heavy weights in the grown while secondary cattle were well supplied. Trade cattle eased 16c/kg for most and more in places. Grown steers and bullocks sold firm to 10c easier and manufacturing steers lost 17c/kg. Heavy heifers gave back 25c/kg. Cows eased 10c to 15c/kg. Heavy bulls improved 9c/kg. 

Vealers sold from 290c to 332c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade made between 310c and 330c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks sold between 330c and 350c/kg. Heavy grown heifers with finish made from 321c to 339c/kg. 

Manufacturing steers sold from 270c to 340c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made between 230c and 280c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly between 260c and 314c/kg. Heavy bulls made from 256c to 307c/kg.
