Commentary
"Numbers more than doubled for a yarding of 1078 head, consisting of a good supply of yearlings and increased number of weaner steers and heifers, while there was a good offering of cows.  There was a good quality penning of young cattle with the largest percentage of steers and heifers well presented and well bred cattle.  

There was a larger contingent of buyers present and operating, keen to acquire cattle,in a quality driven market.  As a result restocker weaner steers were 20c dearer selling from 320c to 404c for an average of 367c, while restocker weaner heifers sold from 238c to 303c/kg.  Light restocker and background yearling steers gained 20c to 30c selling from 270c to 394c/kg.  Feeder steers were firm to 10c dearer depending on weight and breed quality, most ranged from 296c to 362c/kg.  Feeder heifers were 10c to 20c dearer selling from 262c to 324c/kg.  

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows along with a small penning of grown steers, while there was a few lines of grown heifers.  Grown steers were up to 20c dearer selling to a top of 284c to process and 330c/kg to feeders.  Grown heifers made similar gains with heifers to process selling to 290c and feeders toped at 300c/kg.  There was a good run of well finished heavy cows which met very keen demand to be 50c dearer, with 4 scores selling from 258c to 282c/kg.  Restocker cows sold to 282c/kg.
