Commentary
"Numbers doubled for a yarding of 1300 cattle. Quality improved somewhat with some outstanding export cattle on offer along with a great selection of British and Euro weaners and yearlings. Most of the regular buying panel were in place in a market that was generally firm to dearer for most grades.
 
Weaner steers back to the paddock improved by 10c/kg selling from 360c to 434c/kg, heavier types over 330kg making from 340c to 384c/kg. Weaner heifers followed suit making from 236c to 352c/kg with the local Butcher calves making up to 342c/kg.
 
Medium weight yearling steers to background and feed were firm on last weeks rates trading between 335c and 358c/kg, over 400kg saw lot feeder orders highly active to be 16c to 28c/kg dearer selling between 340c and 380c/kg. Yearling heifers were steady trading between 284c and 334c/kg for the medium weights and up to 346c/kg for those weighing in excess of 400kg.
 
The few heavy grown steers and heifers suitable for the exporters were markedly dearer selling from 316c to 348c/kg. An excellent Cow offering of around 160 head the bulk being medium and heavy prime cows saw healthy gains of 12c to 18c/kg trading from 298c to 316c/kg.
