Commentary
"There was a reduction in numbers and the quality was back with more plainer yearlings offered. Feeders and restockers purchased all of the light and medium weights yearlings and once the weight reached around 450kg and heavier and the cattle had cover that when the buyers kicked up. There was a limited supply of grown steers and most were 2 and 4 tooths and a very good run of grown heifers. Around 230 cows were penned and the market was softer on the lighter plainer yarding but held firm on most of the heavy feeders and processing cattle. Cows were cheaper.
 
The best of the light weaner steers reached 428c/kg. Light and medium weight feeder steers were around 15c softer selling from 270c to 341c/kg. Heavy feeders averaged firm to 2c dearer ranging from 327c to 342c/kg. Medium weight feeder heifers eased 6c selling between 291c and 326c while forward condition heavy weights lifted 7c reaching 329c/kg.
 
Grown steers were firm to 8c cheaper and ranging from 344c to 364c and heavy bullocks were stronger on limited numbers reaching 369c/kg. the run of grown heifers were firm310c to 334c/kg. Cows were back around 20c with the prime heavy weights selling from 272c to 295c and 2 score medium weights 245c to 273c/kg."
