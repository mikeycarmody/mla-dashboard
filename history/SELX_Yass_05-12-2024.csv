Commentary
"There was a slight increase in numbers for a total yarding of 956 mostly good quality cattle. There were some outstanding runs of ideal feeder steers, along with some well-bred weaners returning to the paddock, and there were 165 cows, including some high yielding heavy types. All the usual buyers were operating, along with some extra restocker interest, resulting in dearer trends.

The limited supply of yearlings to process lifted 7c, selling from 280c to 340c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers jumped 20c, making from 278c to 366c, and heifers to feed were also dearer selling 270c to 312c/kg. Young cattle suiting the restockers were considerably dearer, with the steers ranging from 285c to 362c, and the heifers sold from 220c to 340c/kg.

There were not enough heavy grown cattle to quote. Cows were up to 13c dearer, with the 2 and 3 scores making from 200c to 275c, and heavy prime cows made from 276c to 305c/kg. Heavy bulls to process reached 290c/kg.
