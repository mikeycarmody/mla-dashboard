Commentary
"Numbers reduced by 634 for a yarding of 3151 cattle.  Quality was good overall, comprising of an increased supply of heavy prime cows and several good lines of store steers and heifers.  A reduced buyer gallery was in attendance - one central processor operated for the first time this year - most regular processors were supported by one live exporter, two feeder buyers and opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Georgetown, Ingham, Ayr and the local area.

Values for better quality prime cattle were firm to 16c higher, with improved quality and factor, however many store lines met subdued demand, resulting in lower values than last sale, with some pens difficult to sell.

Suitably weaned steers below 200kg to restockers sold to 260c to average 246c, similar heifers returning to the paddock reached 206c to average 198c/kg. Steers above 200kg averaged 289c selling to 294c, similar heifers returning to the paddock averaged 185c/kg. Yearling steers above 200kg returning to the paddock averaged 248c to 265c selling to 290c, steers above 280kg averaged 236 and steers above 330kg averaged 231c/kg. Yearling steers above 400kg  to feed averaged 242c/kg. Yearling heifers above 200kg to restockers averaged 180c to 184c, a good sample of 280kg returning to the paddock topped at 255c to average 223c/kg, while heifers to feed averaged 190c/kg.

A small sample of grown steers to live export made from 250c to 268c, similar steers to feed destined for live export sold to 266c to average 251c/kg. Best quality grown heifers to the trade reached 238c to average 222c/kg.

A small sample of heavy bullocks to processors sold to 252c, most around 230. Medium weight 2 score cows made to 198c to average 194c, 3 score cows sold to 220c to average 197c to 199c/kg.
An increased supply of prime heavyweight cows topped at 240c to average 211c to 217c/kg.

A very small supply of heavy bulls to feed destined for live export averaged 238c/kg.
