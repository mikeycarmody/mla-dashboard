Commentary
"There was an increase in supply with heavy weight yearling steers and cows showing the best representation. The quality of the offering was very mixed with few lines in double figures. There was increased restocker and feedlot competition while the regular processors were in attendance.

Market trends were generally cheaper through the young cattle however there were a few positive trends. Weaner steers to restockers sold to cheaper trends with quality a factor as most of the good weaners have been sold through the Weaner sales. The lighter end of the heifer weaners also sold to cheaper trends with those carrying more weight selling to a dearer trend. Nothing to compare to in medium weight yearling steers from the previous sale however they were comparable to other local sales. The heavy weight feeder steers saw little but quality related price change. Light and medium weight yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends while the heavy weights showed an improved market trend.

Heavy weight export cattle saw demand from processors much weaker. This resulted in the well finished heavy grown steers and heifers selling to much cheaper trends. The cow market fell substantially in the fortnight showing falls of 30c to 40c/kg. The bull market followed suit."
