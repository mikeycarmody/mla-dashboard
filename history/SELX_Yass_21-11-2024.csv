Commentary
"There were some good runs of feeder steers, along with a few pens of prime yearling heifers in a decreased yarding of 714 mixed quality cattle. There was a limited supply of young cattle to suit the restockers and there were 90 cows. Buyers were not as active as previous sales, selling to mostly cheaper trends.

Yearlings to suit the trade were mostly firm, with the steers reaching 336c, and heifers made from 230c to 320c/kg. There was some strong competition between backgrounders and the feedlot buyers for the yearling steers, resulting in dearer prices, selling from 274c to 343c/kg. Heifers to feed were up to 12c cheaper, to average 268c/kg. Weaners returning to the paddock sold to variable trends, with the steers ranging from 160c to 342c, and the heifers ranged from 170c to 306c/kg.

Heavy grown steers slipped 4c selling from 245c to 322c, and grown heifers fell 10c, making from 242c to 320c/kg. 2 and 3 score cows were up to 17c cheaper, ranging from 185c to 255c, and heavy 4 score cows were back 2c, topping at 279c/kg. The best heavy weight bull made 300c/kg.
