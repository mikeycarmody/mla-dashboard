Commentary
"Numbers increased again on the back of the bigger yarding a week ago, reaching 2300 head. Cows made up about a third of the offering, with the balance a mixed run of export steers, grown heifers and younger trade types. The regular buyers which have been active at Shepparton recently were back at the rail, but bidding was weaker and more selective across all grades. The lead of the heavy beef cows were 15c to 20c/kg cheaper while the dairy run gave back 25c to 30c/kg. The grown heifer sections showed a similar price decline. In the grown steers the feature pens of well-bred and finished Angus, Speckle Park and Euro cross sold at close to similar levels, however once off the top prices were cheaper with age, horns and quality all factors in price outcomes.

The heaviest beef cows with weight and showing plenty of fat cover sold from 290c to a top of 315c/kg however  there was only a couple of processors which seemed comfortable chasing the best pens above 300c. Beef cows with not quite as much carcass finish, in fat score 3 condition, ranged from 260c to 302c to average 281c/kg.  Plainer beef cows 230c to 260c/kg. In the dairy cow run a few pens of fresh conditioned Friesians sold from 260c to 285c. The bulk of the Friesian cows with less fat cover from 210c to 255/kg, with the plainest dairy cows down to 150c at times. Bidding was selective over the manufacturing steers, the heavier Friesians ranging from 241c to a top of 300c/kg.

There was some quality grown steers presented and the best pens were close to firm reaching 378c/kg, but the overall average was 10c off as buyers picked through at 311c to 360c/kg for most. Grown heifers faced a tougher market loosing up to 30c at 255c to 325c/kg as they were dragged back into the realm of cow money.

The trade run was very mixed for quality and breed type. The best of the yearling type steers and heifers displaying shape and high carcass yields sold from 340c to 380c/kg, behind the market peak of 405c a week ago. After this demand was selective on the general run of young steers and heifers which sold from 260c to 330c/kg to a mix of processors, feeders and restockers.
