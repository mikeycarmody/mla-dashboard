Commentary
"There was a reduction in supply, not uncommon at this time of the year. A very mixed quality penning was presented to a reduced field of buyers. Young cattle were well supplied as were cows while there were limited numbers of export cattle.

Very good overnight rain provided a boost in the young cattle market with restockers almost guaranteed an outstanding season. There was significant improvement in the light and medium weight yearling steers. The better quality light weight yearling heifers sold on a mostly firm market trend. There was an odd slightly dearer sale while the plainer quality lots lost a little ground. The medium and heavy weights saw attracted less competition to sell to a slightly cheaper trend.

The small numbers of heavy grown steers suitable to process sold to a cheaper trend with the well finished grown heifers following a similar trend. There was a reduction in the cow market in line with what has happened at other recent markets with all but a few restocker cows much cheaper than the sale of a fortnight ago. A large offering of bulls sold to a slightly cheaper trend."
