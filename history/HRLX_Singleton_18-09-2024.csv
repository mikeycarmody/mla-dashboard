Commentary
"With light frosts still occurring throughout the drawing area agents yarded 634 cattle similar numbers to last week. Quality was fair, not all of the regular processing orders were at the rail whilst there was a greater selection of high yielding grain assisted Butcher calves on offer and the highlight of the day were the best of these topping at 400c/kg. There were very few export cattle in the yarding the balance made up of very mixed yearlings and some bigger lines of well-bred weaners.

 Light steer weaners were 3c to 7c/kg dearer selling from 324c to 468c/kg the few over 330kg making from 336c to 428c/kg. Light heifer weaners held firm selling from 270c to 338c/kg B muscles to 340c/kg. Heavier types over 330kg 300c to 348c/kg with trade butcher heifer calves making up to 380c/kg.

Too few yearlings mainly sold in singles to gain a real feel for the market however medium weight heifers to the lot feeders sold to dearer trends trading from 246c to 352c/kg. 2 score Cows only medium frame 198c to 272c/kg, the odd heavy prime Cow 270c to 290c/kg. The best heavy Bull made 260c/kg.
