Commentary
"There was a very small yarding of 60 cattle with more yearlings and less grown steers and cows.
The trade cattle market was 10c to 15c dearer with steers making 224c to 256c and heifers 190c to 250c. The few grown steers made 220c to 250c while the heavy cows sold from 160c to 188c/kg. Heavy bulls sold for 140c to 164c.
