Commentary
"In whatâ€™s likely to be the largest penning since the end of the drought numbers lifted by 1000 head. Producers taking the opportunity of a reasonably buoyant market to offload as many as possible. The yarding was dominated by yearlings along with a good supply of cows. There was a fair supply of heavy grown steers. The quality of the young cattle was quite mixed with large numbers of mixed breed pens. Condition varied from fair to very good through all categories. There was a bit less processor activity while feedlot demand waned.

Limited supplies of vealers to suit restockers sold to a much cheaper trend. Cheaper trends were the order of the day through the large numbers of yearlings where the supply outweighed demand for the first time in a while. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed saw trends 5c to 10c/kg cheaper with the medium weights least affected. There was little in the way of breed premiums in the heavy weight feeders. Yearlings heifers suffered the same fate as the steer portion with cheaper trends the norm. The medium weights were back as much as 20c/kg while the heavy weights were less affected. There was a more pronounced breed premium in the heifer yearlings for the right quality and weight. Heavy yearlings to the trade also sold to cheaper trends on the back of the reduced demand from feedlotters.

An improved quality penning of heavy grown steers suitable to the processors sold on a cheaper trend however that improvement in quality did account for an increase in averages. Grown heifers to process also sold to cheaper trends. There were varying trends in the cow market where those going into a feed yard sold to a dearer trend. The meatworks cows saw a firm to cheaper trend with the higher yielding heavy weights showing little change while those showing a lowered yield potential were as much as 5c/kg cheaper."
