Commentary
"Gunnedah numbers declined by 1135 head due to widespread rain events through the drawing area to offer 700 good quality cattle which included a very good offering of heavy cows that stood out to top at 345c/kg. Light cows also improved significantly in value.The regular buying gallery attended to a generally dearer trend although not all buyers operated.

Steer weaners under 200kgs were dearer to restockers 370c to 482c/kg. Similar heifers 316c to 385c/kg. Light background steers 371c to 400c/kg and medium feeders sold  to dearer trends reaching 452c/kg. Heavy  steers to process made to 365c/kg. Feeder heifers under 330kgs 325c to 354c/kg and medium weights 347c to 374c/kg. Heavy yearling heifers to process 360c to 384c/kg.

Heavy grown heifers to the trade 330c to 354c/kg. Four score cows 310c to 345c/kg three scores 264c to 305c/kg. Heavy bulls 276c to 307c/kg.
