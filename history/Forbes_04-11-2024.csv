Commentary
"Numbers dropped by 580 for a yarding of 1264 cattle. Quality was mixed with prime yearlings and grown cattle well represented. Feeder weight cattle were also well supplied and there were limited numbers of cows. Not all the regular buyers were present.

Young cattle to the trade were down 15c to 20c, prime yearling steers sold from 260c to 344c, and prime yearling heifers, 261c to 337c/kg. Feeder steers slipped 6c, 290c to 357c, while feeder heifers held firm, 240c to 316c/kg.

Prime grown steers were firm to dearer, 270c to 359c, and prime grown heifers sold 10c cheaper, 270c to 346c/kg. Cows lifted 10c, 2 and 3 scores sold from 180c to 285c, and heavy prime cows, 285c to 300c/kg.
