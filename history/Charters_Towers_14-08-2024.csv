Commentary
"Useful rain in the local area saw numbers fall by around 200 for a yarding of 1745 cattle. Quality was mixed -with the supply of prime cattle halving on last week- however some good pens of well finished, heavy bullocks and cows were penned, supported by some very good quality store steers and heifers.  All regular processors were in attendance and operating, supported by one feeder, local opportunity restockers and backgrounders along with central backgrounders. Cattle were drawn from Normanton, Georgetown, Hughenden, The Belyando and the local area.

Values lifted across most categories, particularly better quality lines. Yearling steers and heifers improved by 10c to 40c, prime grown steers, bullocks and cows averaged 6c to 35c better.

Very good quality weaned steers above 200kg to restockers sold to 320c to average 294c to 315c, lighter weights averaged 291c/kg. A good sample of lightweight heifers to backgrounders reached 236c to average 231c/kg. Yearling steers above 280kg to feed sold to 280c to average 273c, feeder types averaged 276c/kg. Steers above 330kg to feed reached 312c to average from 268c to 295c/kg. Yearling heifers above 280kg returning to the paddock sold to 236c to average 197c, heavy heifers above 400kg to processors made to 272c to average 271c/kg.

Grown steers above 400kg to feed sold to 312c to average 299c, heavy trade types made to 288c, most around 275c/kg. Good quality heavy grown heifers to the trade sold to 270c to average 248c, plainer types averaged 189c/kg.

Small lines of heavy 3 and 4 score bullocks to export slaughter topped at 292c, averaging from 276c to 286c/kg. Lightweight cows to processors sold to 190c to average 169c, medium weight 3 score cows sold to 272c to average 240c and prime heavyweight cows topped at 270c to average 268c/kg.  Heavy bulls to processors sold to 266c to average 263, bulls to feed destined for live export averaged 249c/kg.
