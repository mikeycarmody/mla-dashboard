Commentary
"The very strong cow market was the highlight in a much larger yarding of 5810. It was a fair quality yarding with good numbers of prime cattle in all sections along with large numbers of far western cattle which mostly presented in good strong condition. The usual buyers were operating along with a couple of extra southern export orders.
 
Young cattle to the trade were dearer with prime vealers and yearlings selling from 300c to 378c/kg. Feeder steers finished firm to 5c/kg dearer while the feeder heifers were up to 14c/kg dearer. Feeder steers sold from 290c to 386c while the feeder heifers sold from 280c to 368c/kg. Young cattle to the restockers were around firm with the young steers selling to 440c and the young restocker heifers sold to 346c/kg.
 
Grown steers and heifers were 3c to 8c dearer with the prime grown steers selling from 319c to 380c while the prime grown heifers sold from 300c to 348c/kg. Cows were up to 30c dearer with the 2 and 3 scores selling from 210c to 315c/kg. Prime heavy weight cows sold from 310c to 343c to average 325c/kg. Cows to the restockers sold from 210c to 277c/kg. Heavy bulls were up to 15c dearer selling to 326c and young bulls to feed sold from 297c to 328c/kg.
