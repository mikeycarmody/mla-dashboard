Commentary
"There was a reduction in supply with wet weather over the weekend contributing. The quality of the offering was very mixed with a greater percentage of plain and secondary quality cattle penned. There was a full field of buyers in attendance. Demand was high through most categories.

Restocker demand was high on the back of the recent rain event with a bumper Spring almost assured. This resulted in the light and medium weight yearling steers selling to a dearer trend with most of the good quality lots showing considerable improvement. Heavy weight feeder steers  also attracted strong competition to also show a dearer trend. Restockers were also active in the heifer classes as were feedlotters, trends dearer. There were limited supplies of well finished heifers suitable to the trade, no comparison from the last sale available.

There were too few good quality grown steers to quote with the majority down on quality and falling into the manufacturing steer category. They sold strongly given the quality on display. There was less competition on the well finished grown heifers with the market easing. A strong cow market saw trends dearer with the heavyweights improving by as much as 13c/kg."
