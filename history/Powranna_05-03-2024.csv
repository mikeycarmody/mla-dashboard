Commentary
"There was a smaller yarding of 147 trade and export cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with many less cows than in recent weeks. The market for good quality yearlings was strong but secondary types were harder to sell. Yearling steers made 178c to 236c and heifers 176c to 230c/kg.
There was a good lineup of grown steers and bullocks with most making 180c to 226c/kg. The quality of cows was very mixed with the best making 128c to 162c while very lean cows made 10c to 30c/ kg liveweight.
