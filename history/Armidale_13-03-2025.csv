Commentary
"Yearlings, heavy grown steers and cows were well supplied in a reduced penning. There was a large variation in quality through most of the categories. Well-bred lines of yearlings and grown steers were penned alongside a fair supply of secondary quality cattle. There was also quite a variation in the condition of the offering. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Restockers showed a great deal of confidence in future markets and seasonal conditions to compete strongly for light and medium weight young cattle. Market trends for young steers were dearer than the previous sale 2 weeks ago. Light weight yearling steers to restockers were as much as 13c/kg dearer. Medium weights saw a breed related improvement of as much as 25c/kg with some well renowned lines on offer. Heavy yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend of up to 4c/kg. Yearling heifers to restock and feed also experienced dearer trends with medium weights up to 13c dearer while a very good quality penning of heavy weight feeders were up to 7c/kg dearer.

Limited supplies of well finished heavy grown steers suitable to the processors sold to a cheaper trend. Breed accounted for some strong sales in the feeder steers in excess of 500kg. The cow market was cheaper with the trend showing a decline of 4c to 6c/kg. Not all processors participated. Heavy bulls were firm to dearer."
"Yardings were reduced with weaner and vealers numbers most affected. This was due to the first weaner sale of the season being held tomorrow. Overall the quality of the offering was fair to good, although vealer steer quality was off. There were some handy cows and heavy steers in the offering, but overall the cattle are showing the effects of the colder weather and dry feed conditions. There was one less buyer of slaughter cattle in the market this week.

Competition for vealer steers was not as strong, resulting in a cheaper trend, down 6c to 13c/kg. Heifer vealers met solid competition from processors to remain fully firm. There were odd sales of the better finished vealer heifers that saw a slight improvement in value. Yearling steers to restockers and lot feeders sold at firm rates. The heifer yearlings saw a bit of price trend variation, for the most part heifers going to the feed pens sold to a cheaper trend, there were a few plainer conditioned lightweights that sold at dearer rates.

The offering of heavy steers consisted mainly older types, with no heavy milk or 2 teeth steers penned. The market trend was firm with the age and quality putting downward pressure on averages. The better medium and heavy cows sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 6c/kg. The cows most affected in a cheaper market were the plainer conditioned and lower yielding grades through all weight ranges, they were 13c to 20c/kg cheaper. The restocker cows showing plenty of frame were less affected. Bulls also experienced a cheaper market trend."
"Yardings reduced and the condition of the offering was plain with prime condition cattle in limited numbers through all categories. Most regular buyers were in attendance, the absentees would have struggled to find cattle to their specifications.

Fair quality, plain conditioned cattle dominated the young cattle offering. Restocker vealer steers sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 6c/kg with the quality also showing a decline. Heifer vealers to restockers remained firm, while the vealers to processors also saw little change. The light yearling steers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend, while the medium and heavyweights were firm to 5c/kg dearer. There were a small number of heavy trade yearling steers that sold well, although there were none here last week to compare too. The light and medium heifer yearlings sold firm with those over 400kg selling a little dearer, particularly to the trade.

There were some handy heavy steers although not quite up to last weekâ€™s quality. The younger end sold dearer, up 1c to 3c/kg, while the older steers remained firm. The best of the grown heifers were slightly dearer. The cow market varied a little, plain light cows were 3c to 7c/kg dearer. The medium weight cows remained mostly firm while the best of the heavy cows sold firm to slightly dearer for quality."
"Yardings increased by 20% with double the number of cows. Young cattle were also well represented. The quality offered was fair to good, however there were few well finished yearlings suitable for the trade. The majority of the finished cattle were in the grown classes. The regular processor and feeder orders were in place. 

The market for young cattle saw vealer steers to restock sell firm to slightly dearer for medium weights with a small improvement in average quality. Heifer vealers to the processors sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Lightweight yearling steers to restock struggled to remain firm with the upcoming start of the weaner run. Medium and heavy yearlings to restock and feed saw little but quality related change. Quality was also a factor in the cheaper average prices for yearling heifers to restock, some sales of lightweight heifers were a little dearer. The limited supply of well finished heifers suitable to the trade sold to a dearer trend.

Heavy grown steers sold firm to slightly cheaper with some age related price variation. Well finished grown heifers sold firm to dearer. The large offering of cows, saw those to restockers remain firm with those to processors firm to cheaper with quality related variations."
"With winter fast approaching, producers have made the decision to offload, causing the biggest offering of the year to date. Weaners, yearling heifers and cows made up the bulk of the penning. Plain conditioned cattle dominated the penning with well finished cattle in limited numbers. All regular buyers were in attendance along with an odd extra buyer brought by the numbers.

The market was solid throughout. Vealers and weaners met good competition from both processors and restockers. Steer weaners were generally firm, however the increased numbers brought about some quality variation affecting some values. There was an improved quality offering of heavy steer weaners that sold at slightly improved rates. The heifer vealers under strong processor interest sold firm to 6c/kg dearer with the odd sales slightly more.

There were limited numbers of yearling steers penned with most being purchased by restockers at unchanged rates. The yearling heifers consisted of quite a number not quite finished stock. This had little effect on the market with most grades selling at dearer rates, up 6c/kg.

There were limited numbers of grown steers on offer with heifers and cows making up the majority of the grown cattle offering. Included in the offering was a run of empty cows and heifers in store condition. There was increased competition on the grown cattle, with the market seeing a dearer trend. The few heavy steers sold 15c to 20c/kg dearer. The grown heifers under strong restocker bidding also sold at dearer rates. The cow market saw restockers bid strongly, dearer by 10c to 17c/kg and more in places with quality lines also contributing to the rise. Medium and heavy cows to processors also sold to a dearer trend, up 10c/kh and more in places."
"With Winter approaching and no rain in sight consignments lifted. Most categories were well represented with quality generally good. The condition of the cattle penned was quite mixed, with feeder and restocker cattle well supplied. The full complement of regular buyers was in attendance and there was an extra processor operating. Trends were generally cheaper.

Restockers were again active on vealers to restock, with light and medium weight steers experiencing little but quality related change. Heavy steer vealers to restock sold to a cheaper trend with prices well down due to breed changes. Heifer vealers to restock also sold to a cheaper trend with light weights substantially so due to reduced competition. Yearling steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend with light weights well down as restockers opt for similar weight vealers at this  time of year. Medium and heavy feeder yearling steers were down 9c to 11c/kg. Similar weight yearling heifers to feed were 6c to 10c/kg cheaper.

An improved quality penning of heavy grown steers, both feeders and to process sold to a dearer trend. Feeders over 500kg averaged 6c dearer with those to process improving by 9c/kg. Cow market trends were cheaper by 5c to 6c/kg with odd sales firm, while quality had a greater effect on restocker cows."
"With the yarding sizes appearing to be fairly stable for a time, the quality on most of the cattle was slightly improved even though the tail end was very plain for both condition and breed quality. Cows and weaners made up the greatest percentage of the yarding, but there were some pens of good trade and restocker yearlings. There were insufficient heavy steers and bullocks available to quote a price change.

There was plenty of demand across all descriptions and while steer weaners stayed fully firm, the heifer portion gained up to 8c/kg. Restocker demand strengthened as growers were looking for cheaper, lightweight weaners to feed off rapidly growing oat crops. Yearling steers and feeder steers were firm for the best but dropped some price for plain bred types. Trade cattle met keen demand and sold to a dearer trend. 

There were no pens of bullocks to quote. Cow prices started off at firm but soon picked up in value as the better quality cattle began to be offered. Rises averaging 7c/kg and reaching up to 12c/kg on odd sales, were recorded on cows, with restockers pushing prices up on the plainer types, whether joined or unjoined. Bull values rose by an average 8c/kg.

The top sale price paid was 200c/kg for light steer weaners that went to a restocker."
"With the weather rapidly going from bad to worse, the numbers that are usually reserved for the late autumn, are coming into the market two months earlier. A major proportion of the yarding were cows and light vealers while most other descriptions were in limited numbers.

There was a weakening in the restocker and feeder steer demand with the result that yearling steers were cheaper. The light vealers were fully firm on last sale for all the better types but the plain bred, or out of condition calves, sold at cheaper rates continuing a trend started a few weeks ago. There were not enough trade weight cattle available to quote a market.

There were a few pens of fairly well finished bullocks yarded and they sold at similar rates to the previous sale. A little more competition on boner cows saw a dearer trend emerge and that trend also carried through to the heavier types of cow. The bull market was unchanged.

The top sale price was 152.2c/kg paid for a small pen of medium bullocks."
"With the upcoming break in sales numbers increased substantially to see the largest sale for quite sometime. The quality of the offering was very mixed with a good supply of yearlings and cows. There were very few larger lines of cattle available. The condition of the offering showed great variation. There was reduced processor competition in the general run while there was an extra processor in the bull market . Restockers and feedlots were active.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with light weight yearling steers to restockers selling to cheaper trends with some of the larger falls related to quality variations. Medium and heavy weight feeder steers sold to dearer trends with some well bred pens available. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers sold on a firm to slightly cheaper market trend. That was also the case for the medium weights. There were odd well finished trade heifers that were slightly dearer. The large increase in numbers had an effect on the average quality in most classes with this also impacting average prices.

No heavy grown steers to quote. The well finished grown heifers to process were dearer. The reduced processor competition saw a fall in the cow market of as much as 14c/kg. The extra competition for heavy bulls resulted in a significantly dearer market trend."
"With the spring flush of feed not progressing as hoped numbers doubled. Young cattle were well supplied along with a fair penning of cows. There were also around 90 cow/calf units penned at the end of the sale, part of a herd dispersal included in the numbers. The condition of the young cattle was plain, while there were some well finished cows penned. 

The benefit of recent rains was over shadowed by unseasonably warm weather and hot dry winds over the past few days. This impacted on the market for young cattle going to restockers, resulting in yearling steers selling to a cheaper trend. There was some quality and breed related price change also, with most of the previous weeks price improvement erased. There was a much larger penning of yearling heifers this week, making a market comparison difficult.

The grown cattle section was dominated by cows with too few heavy grown steers to make a market comparison. A little more demand from processors saw the cow market show a dearer trend, up 2c to 4c/kg. 

The cow/calf units sold at the end of the sale, made from $690 to $805/unit."
"With the slightly bigger yarding the average quality improved marginally, but the overall description of the yarding was still plain and dry. There were more and better quality yearling steers yarded with all of then going to restockers. Yearling heifers weighing between 160 and 210kg were yarded in very big numbers with most very light on for condition. There were just a few heavy steers and only one pen of finished bullocks yarded. Cows were in bigger numbers but the average yield was quite low. There were not many bulls yarded.

With the same buyers in attendance the general trend of the young cattle market was cheaper as the numbers across the North increase and the quality tends to deteriorate. In the restocker yearling steers there were plenty that lost as much as 20c/kg from the price in one week. Plain and light heifers were also much cheaper but the better finished trade heifers sold at almost firm rates. The drop off in store demand was quite marked as the local growers think about what next move to make in the face of the continuing dry.

There were insufficient heavy steers or bullocks yarded to quote a market. Cows were in greater numbers and sold at fully firm rates. There were just an odd pen of lighter conditioned slaughter cows that sold up to 4c/kg dearer but they were the exception."
"With the season in the district continuing to cause concern the numbers increased this week. The condition and makeup of the yarding was very plain with very few fat cattle and the majority of the yarding were very light weaners and yearlings. There were no trade cattle available and bullocks and grown steers were in very light numbers. There were only a few cows yarded but bulls were in fair numbers.

There was a very strong market for all the light vealers and yearlings with half the heifer yarding going to slaughter and all the steers and half the heifers bought by restockers. Dearer prices were paid for almost all the young cattle with the usual buyers attending.Restock demand was a little greater than the last sale. 

With such a small heavy steer and bullock yarding any quote on price change would not be reliable. The small cow yarding made it hard for buyers to get started and that may account for the slight cheapening in the market. Bulls were in fair numbers and sold to a solid demand."
"With the public holiday a factor numbers more than halved. The quality of the offering was mixed, with a surprising percentage of unfinished cattle penned despite the good seasonal conditions. Young cattle were well supplied with all other grades represented. Not all regular processor orders were in place. 

The market experienced cheaper trends in the main. Vealers to the trade were 2c to 4c/kg cheaper, with steer vealers to restockers showing a greater fall. Yearling steers to restock and feed also trended cheaper through all weight classes, with the odd pen of good quality steers maintaining firm rates. A decrease in the average quality of yearling steers was a contributing factor in their decrease in price. Heifer yearlings to restock also sold cheaper, down 4c to 12c/kg, with quality also a contributing factor in any other price change.

The quality and condition of the grown steers was plainer, with restockers and feedlots well catered for. The few heavy steers sold to processors were at cheaper rates. Grown heifers sold much cheaper. The cow market also experienced cheaper trends, down 3c to 6c/kg."
"With the poor seasonal conditions, numbers reached their highest level in more than a decade. There were large numbers in most categories, highlighted by the early sell off of vealers normally retained until the annual weaner sales. Producers started to offload breeders with cow numbers once again very high. The quality of the offering was quite mixed and there were limited numbers of well-finished cattle. A large gallery of buyers and onlookers were in attendance including a full field of processors. The large numbers brought extra orders into the market, with most categories selling to a dearer trend. The larger numbers did bring about some quality related price changes.

There was good competition for vealer steers from restockers, with the market trend 10c to 20c/kg dearer and more in places. Processor demand for vealer heifers was restricted to those showing good condition, with the market up to 3c/kg dearer. Restockers were active on the balance with trends for all but the very plain quality lines dearer. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend under extra competition, with the heavy feeders seeing the best of prices. There was some quality related price change evident in the light and medium weights. Yearling heifers followed the dearer trend with strong gains seen in the secondary quality lots, while the best of the light and medium weights remained close to firm.

Heavy grown steers remained firm with quality related price changes. Large numbers of plain conditioned cows were presented, with the market showing significant price improvement, up 15c to 20c/kg with little extra competition. There was little change in the better 3 and 4 score lines."
"With the exception of the cows and a few pens of middle weight bullocks, the yarding was plain with the bulk of the offering being light yearling heifers. Cows were in fair numbers and most gave an indication of high yields. The usual regular buyers attended, together with increased numbers of local Restockers.

Light yearling heifers were fully firm but the market eased by two to three cents per kilogram for heavier types. The restocker demand for light yearling steers was again very keen  with values up by 5c or 6 cents per kilogram on cattle a little over 200 kilograms.

The cow market was fully firm with some very good quality cattle a feature of the sale. Bulls sold strongly but some of the export weight heifers attracted less attention than in recent weeks."
"With the exception of some pens of weaners and vealers the average quality of the yarding was well below the last sale. The weaners and vealers made up the bulk of the yarding while cows and yearling steers were well represented in numbers. There were few quality bullocks or heavy steers in the yarding and their finish was below a reasonable level. The cows were not up to the usual high yield for the second successive week as growers take advantage of the good prices to sell older cows and their calves as a separate unit.

There was plenty of competition available for any steer weaners or yearling steers and the market was basically fully firm for these cattle. However, there were pens of quality weaners that sold to a dearer market while not affecting the overall average price. Heifer vealers both lightweight and over 200kgs sold to a marginally easier trend while trade heifers were fully firm on last sale rates.

The heavy steers and the few bullocks showed little change in price for a lower quality product but it is obvious that the demand is there for the better cattle but they are now difficult to source. There was a keen demand for cow beef with some of the lighter conditioned types selling a little dearer due to some restocker influence. On the better finished cows and the bulls the market was unchanged."
"With the exception of soime pens of cows and yearling restocker steers, the quality of the yarding was again fairly plain. With the pasture growing reasonably well, it should not be too long before some better conditioned cattle reach the sale. Yearlings and cows were in the most numbers but heavy steers and vealers were very short supplied.

It was a cheaper market trend with a lesser interest shown by restockers. Plainer young cattle, steers or heifers were cheaper in a range from 15c to 20c/kg with some of the plainest conditioned and lightest muscled cattle, selling down as low as the early 120c/kg. A number of pens of better quality heifers and steers sold at 5c/kg cheaper mainly to restockers.

Export suitable heifers were 10c/kg cheaper  while light cows were 5c/kg cheaper with some interest being shown by restockers. The heavier cows were 8c/kg easier buy bvuyer interest was restricted on all descriptions."
"With the district very wet, numbers reduced to their lowest winter offering. All categories were represented with low numbers in all. The quality and condition of the offering was very mixed, with a few plainer conditioned cattle showing the effects of the cold and wet weather. There was restricted processor competition, however local restockers and some feedlots active. 

Market trends varied through the young cattle. Vealer steers to restockers sold to a significantly cheaper trend while light weight heifer vealers remained firm with some quality related price change. A very mixed quality penning of yearling steers also sold to a cheaper trend with quality affecting price change. Yearling heifers followed a similar trend with the same factors in play.

All the heavy grown steers went to restockers and feedlots, the majority carrying 4 and 6 teeth, while those with 2 teeth attracted strong premiums. There was a fair supply of plain conditioned manufacturing steers penned that sold to a slightly cheaper trend. There was little change in the market for well-finished cows with reduced processor competition. Restockers were active on plainer condition cows and on any pens announced as having been joined. The reduced processor competition was reflected in a cheaper market trend for bulls.

Market Reporter, James Armitage."
"With the district still getting heavy frost it is having the affect of dropping numbers well back from the normal and also rapidly reducing condition on most cattle. There were some pens of good trade and heavier heifers yarded but the bulk of the yearling cattle were down in quality. Splitter vealers under 200kgs were in the biggest percentage in the yarding. There were light cow numbers and only a few singles available in steers or bullocks. There was a fair percentage of restocker cattle in the total and they were all light conditioned.

The demand for light vealers for the splitter trade continues to gain ground with some quite extreme price rises recorded. Restocker steers and heifers sold at much the same prices as the last sale but the average breed quality was well down. Trade heifers carrying some condition sold at fully firm rates.

There were not enough steer or bullocks for a market quote but the few cows available sold at very much firm rates. The bulls yarded were mostly light in condition and in weight.

With the worst part of the season arrived it is not anticipated that many numbers of cattle will come on to the market much before late November."
"With the best part of the winter finished most of the cattle in the yarding were plain in condition and fat cattle were in short supply. Very light weight yearling cattle were in a much greater percentage and there were fair numbers of restocker steers and heavy steers and bullocks. Trade heifers and cows were both in low numbers. 

No cattle sold cheaper in the yarding, but there was a few which sold to a dearer trend with trade heifers marginally dearer. Restocker weaner and yearling cattle sold strongly at firm prices and most were bought by local growers. Feeder steers in all weights sold at unchanged rates.

The heavy steers and bullocks were not in great numbers but quality was fair to good with most off oat crops, which now need rain to regenerate. The prices paid for them were a little dearer than last sale. Cows sold at fully firm prices and so did the feeder steers, which were plainer in condition than usual. The quality of the bull offering was plainer than usual but prices held firm.

Top sale price was 230c/kg paid by restockers for vealer steers of good breed quality."
"With Spring upon us and little in the way of a rain forecast numbers increased this fortnight. Quality and condition showed a great deal of variation in all categories. There was a fair supply of medium and heavy crop-fed yearlings with light weight young cattle also plentiful. There was limited competition from processors and feedlotters, however demand was solid when compared to the previous sale. There was good competition from restockers on the lighter young cattle with a few showing extreme confidence.

Very light weight weaner cattle attracted the strongest and keenest demand to show an extraordinary price improvement. The better quality light weight yearling steers also showed strong price gains on individual pens. The secondary quality lots were firm to cheaper. Quality contributed to a lift in price for medium weight yearling steers to feed. The heavy yearling feeders sold to a cheaper trend with reduced competition. There was little but quality related price change for medium and heavy yearling heifers to feed with some very good quality lots available.

There was a greater selection of well finished heavy grown steers penned, suitable to processors however there were none from the previous sale to compare a market trend to. There was little change in the cow market."
"With some of the drawing area experiencing very good seasonal conditions and some vendors adopting a wait and see attitude, numbers were below the pre-Christmas level. A feature of the offering was a line of very good quality medium weight yearling heifers. Overall however, the quality and condition of the offering was quite mixed. There was reduced processor competition, however the usual restocker and feedlot orders were in place and yearling heifers brought some extra feedlot activity.

Trends through the young cattle varied on the last sale a month ago. Light and medium weight yearling steers sold to a cheaper trend with quality a factor. Heavy feeder steers sold firm to slightly dearer. Those medium weight yearling heifers sold firm to slightly dearer with some improvement being quality related.

A small number of light weight grown steers sold to feedlots at slightly dearer prices. Well finished grown heifers sold to a firm trend. There was little change in the cow market. Heavy bulls were firm to 2c/kg cheaper."
"With so many cattle being sold earlier than usual due to the dry weather, the chance that numbers will remain lower than usual remains a real possibility. There were good numbers of quality weaners in the market together with reasonable cow numbers. There were no trade cattle yarded and only a few older bullocks. Feeder steers were short supplied but the quality was good.

The somewhat vague promise of rain in the north prompted restockers into creating a much dearer market for weaners. There were plenty of pens of steer weaners selling at 20c/kg dearer, while most heifer weaners were 10c/kg dearer. Feeder steers and heifers also met with stronger competition and a dearer price structure. There were no trade yearlings available due to the lack of oat crops which traditionally provide fat trade stock at this time of year.

No bullock or heavy steer quote was possible but the cow price was dearer for two reasons, one being an improvement in yield and the other being the shortage in numbers."
"With similar numbers yarded, there was a noticeable drop in the average quality of the offering. There were a number of lines of quality cattle available but not as many as in earlier sales. Weaner numbers continued to increase and yearlings and cows were in reasonable supply. Almost every pen of weaner and yearling steers were ultimately bought by restockers and most yearling heifers were bought by feedlotters. The numbers of older feeder steers increased sharply and export heifers were well supplied.

The usual regular buyers attended and the market trend, while showing some irregularity, was generally firm. Some pens in the heavier feeder heifers were cheaper by 5c to 7c/kg but the balance of the young cattle including the lighter feeder cattle, remained fully firm. The strength of the local restocker demand was noticeable.

Young bullock numbers were light but the market showed little change. Export heifers and all cows were steady in price and the bull market was dearer by 7c/kg for the heavier muscled cattle. There was no change in feeder steer prices in either domestic or export types."
"With shearing in the Armidale district in full swing, cattle numbers suffered in the smallest yarding for the year. Quality was very plain with the bulk of the offering being light heifer vealers and yearlings, together with some pens of good quality young steers to restockers and a few pens of good cows and bulls.

The buying strength was similar to the last sale and the market trend due to a small yarding was firm to dearer. Light heifers, either vealers or yearlings, sold at very much improved prices with increases recorded at an average of 9c/kg. The light restocker steers also met very strong competition to sell at considerably dearer values. Once again restocker demand exceeded the supply. No quote is possible on trade yearling cattle.

There is no quote on heavy steers or bullocks, but the few good cows sold at unchanged rates compared to the last sale, while the bull market was dearer."
"With seasonal conditions poised to go either way dependant on rain, the numbers showed a further increase in the fortnight. Young cattle and grown heifers were well supplied, while there was a fair supply of cows. The quality and condition of the offering was very mixed, with most of the young cattle and grown heifers categorised into the lower end of the fat scores. There was increased processor and feedlot competition, with local restockers also active.

Market trends varied through the young cattle. Higher restocker demand saw light weight steers sell on a firm to dearer market trend. However, there were breed and quality related price changes. Medium and heavy weight yearling feeder steers sold to a dearer trend of 4c/kg and more in places, where breed played a part. Light weight yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends. Heavier heifers suitable to feed saw a firm to dearer market trend of up to 10c/kg in places.

Grown heifers sold to dearer trend, with lightly muscled lines attracting both feedlot and processor competition. The feedlots competed for those with 4 teeth or less. Well finished C muscle heifers saw a dearer trend of as much as 5c/kg, with the increased processor competition. Plain condition cows sold on a firm to dearer market trend, with some lots showing an increased yield potential. The well finished heavy weight cows sold to a cheaper trend, easing 5c to 7c/kg. Strong competition saw heavy bulls sell to a dearer trend, up to 15c/kg."
"With producers looking for a price advantage following widespread rain, numbers lifted by 490 head. There was a good supply of vealers, with cows in fair numbers. Overall the quality and condition was fair to good. The full field of regular buyers were in attendance, and there were 2 more processors operating in the export section. Demand for all classes was stronger, resulting in dearer trends throughout. The only negative on price change was quality related.

A feature of the vealer offering was a lift in quality in the heavy weight classes. High demand from restockers saw the light and medium weight steers up to 12c/kg dearer. Increased demand from both restocker and to feed buyers, along with the lift in quality, saw the heavier weights up to 20c/kg dearer. Heifer vealers to both the trade and restockers saw the trend dearer by 15c to 17c/kg, with a small number of sales more. There were strong price gains for an improved quality penning of medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed. There were too few yearling heifers to quote a trend.

Grown steers to feed sold to a dearer trend, while there were too few well finished heavy weights to quote. The majority of the grown heifers were plain quality and moderately muscled that attracted both restocker and feedlot competition. The market trend was dearer with premiums for those carrying 2 teeth, and discounts for those with 6. The cow market saw those to process up to 20c/kg dearer, while those to restock saw little but a quality related price change."
"With only one more sale prior to the Christmas break, numbers increased to include over 200 quality cows and calves, sold at open auction at the end of the sale to a top of $1,260/head. The balance of the yarding were yearlings to restock, cows, feeder steers and export heifers. Yearling cattle to the trade market were in very short supply.

The market for all young stock was very steady with restocker steer yearlings, feeder yearling steers and a bigger yarding of feeder heifers, all selling at fully firm rates under strong enquiry. Restockers again preferred to buy the very lightweight weaners and yearlings, with demand improving as the pasture feed situation improves.

No quote on heavy steers or bullocks is available due to the lack of numbers. Heavy export heifers sold at fully firm rates, which have existed now for many weeks with these types of cattle showing a remarkable consistency of both price and supply. With few sales left in the north before the break, cow prices improved by between 3c and 5c/kg under good enquiry. 

The top sale price was 263.2c/kg paid for very lightweight steer yearlings to restock."
"With numbers steady but low for the past few weeks, the quality and yield in export cattle was much improved. However, the yearling cattle quality and weights remained similar to the previous sale. Cows were much heavier and better finished while there were only a few bullocks yarded but they were well fattened and of a high yield. Restocker yearlings again dominated the offering.

Restocker demand was again particularly keen as the season improves locally and the demand from local growers appears to be increasing each week. The steer portion of the yearlings sold at steady rates but restockers made the heifer portion dearer by up to 6c/kg with the lighter weights being in the strongest demand.

The few bullocks available sold at slightly dearer rates but it was the cows which received the strongest attention. The improvement in values varied between 6c and 14c/kg with the improved finish and yield potential being partly responsible for the rise. Only a few bulls were yarded but prices remained steady."
"With numbers stable at present the average quality slipped a little on half the cattle but the balance were right up to the standard of last week. Vealers and weaner cattle were again in big numbers as were the cows. Feeder steers and heavy steers and bullocks were only in fair numbers while trade cattle continue to be light supplied. 

The usual buyers of slaughter cattle attended the sale but the casual buyer of light weaner cattle is dropping out of the market as the winter weather starts to take affect. Some of the heavier weaner heifers were cheaper but the lighter weights sold at fully firm rates. The better steer weaners were fully firm under a strong demand from volume buyers. Trade heifers also sold right up to recent prices and there were no yearling steers bought to kill.

The bullocks were good quality and sold at fully firm prices but any plainer steers and all the feeder steers sold to a cheapening trend. There was a definite cheapening in the lighter and in some of the medium cows but the top cows sold at fully firm prices under a very keen demand. The market for the best heavy bulls was also fully firm again under a strong enquiry.

The top price in the market was 200.6c/kg paid for lightweight steer yearlings bought to grow out on pasture."
"With no sign of rain numbers continue to increase. There were more of the better quality cattle in the yarding but due to the dry weather the yarding quality tailed off very quickly. Weaner steers and vealer heifers were again in big numbers and cows made up a similar percentage of the yarding to last week at 25%. There were some fair trade heifers in the middle weight range in the yarding while there were also some very well finished medium weight bullocks available. The lack of demand for feeder steers reduced the number on offer but plain older steers were in greater numbers than usual. 

It was a very much cheaper market with plenty of the plain conditioned and poorly bred cattle selling up to 20c/kg cheaper. Restocker demand is dwindling in the face of the continuing dry weather with a few pens of the best quality steer weaners selling at close to firm but those cattle were in the minority. The heifer weaners to slaughter and the trade heifers all lost value with the better types not as severely treated as the plain types. The few trade weight steers yarded met fairly harsh treatment from buyers and their price was markedly easier.

The best of the bullocks, which weighed between 600 and 700kgs sold cheaper by only a few cents per kilogram, while lighter weights and condition were cheaper by considerably more. The cows varied between very light weights and up to a few pens of outstanding cows and while they lost some value the degree of loss was not dramatic. In a reversal the bulls sold up to 10c/kg dearer for the better yielding types.

Highest price in the sale was $176c/kg paid by a restocker for steer weaner weighing around 285kgs."
"With no sign of a break in the season, the numbers almost doubled for this sale. All categories were represented in a fair to good quality penning. There were limited supplies of well finished cattle. A feature however was a line of well finished heavy grown steers, not often seen here at this time of year. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Market trends varied through the young cattle, with both breed and quality contributing to some large price differences within some classes. Restocker vealers steers saw a firm to slightly dearer market trend than a fortnight ago. Conversely, the heifer portion were up to 9c/kg cheaper. Light weight yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold to a mostly cheaper trend, however improved quality lots experienced an increase in price. The quality of the medium weight feeder steers improved, resulting in some strong sales. The plainer quality steers were slightly cheaper. Trends were also cheaper through the yearling heifers to restockers and feeders, with strong reductions for plain quality and least preferred breeds.

There was no market comparison for the well finished heavy grown steers, however they attracted strong competition from processors. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, as processors struggled to secure sufficient well finished cattle. Market trends through the cows were cheaper, with the plainer condition lots most affected. Well finished heavy weights sold up to 6c/kg cheaper. There were large numbers of bulls, with heavy weights selling to a dearer trend."
"With no sales for the past 4 weeks and only patchy rain over the district the numbers increased by over 500 head. Most grades were represented, the exception being heavy steers with none penned. The quality of the offering was variable, there were some well finished yearlings penned alongside quite a number of plain lightly muscle young cattle. The first vealers of the season were penned, these being in the lighter weight ranges. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance along with some extra feedlot competition.

With the very low pre Christmas numbers a market comparison is difficult, however rates for comparable grades of trade, restocker and feeder young cattle were dearer throughout and inline with neighbouring markets this week.

There were some good cows penned and although not all regular processors were in attendance the market was dearer and also in line with prices seen earlier this week. Quite a number of bulls penned, the quality only average though."
"With no sale prior to Easter there was an increase in numbers. This is not uncommon for this time of year, with weaning in full swing cows and young cattle were well supplied. The quality of the offering was generally good and condition fair to good. The usual processors were in attendance and there was an increased restocker and feedlot presence.

Market trends varied with lightweight weaners selling to a dearer trend, whilst representing a comparatively low dollar outlay. The medium and heavyweight weaners to restocks sold to a cheaper trend. Breed variations and buyer preference accounted for the range in prices. Medium and heavyweight yearling steers to restock and feed sold on a firm to slightly dearer market trend with increased feedlot competition. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed were generally firm, whilst those to the trade were cheaper.

The limited supply of heavy grown steers and heifers sold to a cheaper trend with some quality related price change. There was little change in the market for cows to process, while restocker cows sold to a cheaper trend. Heavy bulls sold to a cheaper trend."
"With no sale for 2 weeks, the increased supply, combined with weaker restocker and feedlot demand, saw market trends cheaper through all categories. Young cattle were in good supply, with cows also well represented. There were very few grown cattle, with supplies of Vealers to restockers, continuing to increase. The quality of the offering was quite mixed, as was condition. A large percentage of the offering showed the effects of a shortage of both feed and water, with most of the usual buyers in attendance, however operated selectively. 

Vealer steers to restock saw average prices fall by 12c to 35c/kg, in comparison to the previous sale. There was increased activity on heifer vealers, with both restockers and processors competing. A price fall was not as great for steer categories, down 11c to 14c/kg. A very plain quality penning of lightweight yearling steers to restockers saw a price drop similar to that in the vealer steer category. Medium weight yearling feeder steers saw mostly quality related changes, with increased competition recorded as a result. Heavy feeders averaged 18c cheaper, while yearling heifers to restock and feed also trended lower, back 11c to 14c/kg. 

There were too few grown steers and heifers for a market comparison, with the cow market easing throughout the sale, down 4c to 8c/kg and further in places."
"With more growers taking the option of selling in the dry time rather than hand feed their stock, the numbers yarded continued their upward trend. Breed quality was good but there has been a distinct falling off in the numbers of fat cattle available. Weaners were again in the greatest numbers along with cows, but again, bullocks and trade cattle were short supplied. Feeder steers were mainly yearlings while yearling steers to restockers were only in small lines.

There were plenty of buyers in attendance with restocker orders coming in from some Victorian districts as well as a surprising number of more localised orders. Steer weaners sold at almost firm rates with only the odd off type pen showing any weakness in value. Heifer vealers sold well to be dearer by an average of 3c/kg while tradeweight yearling heifers sold also to a dearer trend. Trade steers and restocker yearling steers were steady but in very short supply. 

Bullocks and heavy steers to slaughter were again hard to quote due to the lack of supply but the indications were for a firm market. Demand for cows increased sharply with most lots selling in a range of 3c to 6c/kg dearer with the major buyer accent pointed at the lighter weights. Bull prices were unchanged while feeder cattle sold also at fully firm rates."
"With little or no rain eventuating from the forecast for the weekend, numbers returned to the high levels of two weeks ago. There was a large penning of cows, along with solid numbers of young cattle. The continuing dry conditions are bringing more and more vealers and calves, normally retained until the autumn, onto the market. The quality and condition of the offering varied from very plain through to a few well finished lots. All regular processors were in attendance, however not all operated. There was increased feeder competition, while restocker interest remained low. Despite the increased numbers the market held up reasonably well, with some categories dearer.

The good quality vealers suitable to the processors sold to a dearer trend, with the heifers up to 7c/kg dearer. Restocker vealer steers sold close to firm for the better quality lines. Very light vealers and calves showing dryness sold to a cheaper trend. Medium and heavy yearling steers to feed sold to a dearer trend with increased competition. Yearling heifers to feed also attracted increased demand to show a dearer trend. Some secondary quality lightweight heifers sold to a dearer trend, while the plainest quality lines failed to attract much interest.

The limited supply of well finished heavy grown steers sold firm to slightly cheaper. The very large penning of cows included lines of plain condition cows and very few well finished lots. The market trend saw the plainest of the light and medium weights sell to a cheaper trend, while the better quality 2, 3 and 4 score medium and heavyweights saw little change."
"With hopes of decent rainfall producers withheld some cattle with numbers down by 200 head. Cows made up the biggest percentage and there were fair supplies of yearlings, grown heifers and bulls. The quality of the offering was very mixed and apart from some good cows and heifers, condition was only fair. The usual buyers were in attendance and there was extra restocker and feedlot competition.

Quality variations were a major contributing factor in any negative price changes through young cattle classes with this evident in lightweight yearling steers to restock. Medium weight steers to feed sold to a significantly dearer trend. There was a great deal of quality variation in heifer yearlings with most falling into the lightweight classes strong price gains were experienced as restock and feed orders competed strongly to secure requirements with supplies expected to tighten if good rain occurs.

There were a couple of pens of high quality heavy feeder steers carrying 2 teeth, they attracted strong competition selling to a much dearer trend. Grown heifers to process sold to a dearer trend, up to 5c/kg. Plain condition heifers to restock and feed saw strong price gains on a much dearer trend. Well finished medium and heavy weight cows sold to a dearer trend of 5c to 13c/kg. Increased restocker activity saw light and medium weight 1 and 2 score cows sell to a dearer trend of 14c to 17c/kg. Increased processor competition saw heavy bulls sell to a dearer trend of 24c/kg."
"With hesitation caused by a falling market numbers were down by 30%. Over half the yarding were steers and bullocks between 470 and up towards 600 kgs - good quality, but needing just a little more finish. Quality trade cattle were short as were cows. The market did not suffer any extreme price drops, however most showed some degree of a fall.
Restocker enquiry was evident, but only at what may be described as ""cautious"" values."
"With dry weather conditions prevailing there was an increase in supply. A large offering of cows, with a few good vealers and a fair supply of lightweight yearlings. Most of the regular processors were in attendance, however not all operated. The overall quality of the offering was fair with good runs of cows in varying degrees of finish, while there was little weight or condition on the yearlings.

The young cattle market was reasonably solid with vealers to the trade remaining firm. The lightweight yearling steers to restock remained firm, quality was ok however there was little weight for age. Plain condition lightweight yearling heifers to restock also saw little change, however represented a low dollar per head outlay. There were too few trade heifers to quote a trend.

The quality of the grown steers was plain and there were too few heavy steers to frame a market quote. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend for what was a fairly mixed quality penning. The cow market was cheaper through all grades with the trend down 6c to 10c/kg."
"With a full working week, numbers came up to a more normal level. There was a big improvement in the quality of the cattle offered with most descriptions fairly well represented. Numbers of light vealers under 200kg built up very considerably as the district approaches weaning time. Yearling cattle and heavy steers and bullocks were in fair supply, while cow numbers again kept at a high level. The quality of the yearling off feeder steers was very much better than last week.

The market for all cattle was again very strong and consistent with the usual buyers attending and there was an increase in the demand for feeder and restocker cattle. The market for light vealers and trade cattle was unchanged on the last sale, while there was a strengthening in the feeder steers rate with a shortage of these cattle evident across the Northern yards. The same situation applies to restocker yearling cattle.

There was another strengthening in the heavy steer and the bullock market with prices marginally dearer. Cows sold strongly again with prices not changing much from last week. There is a very strong restocker enquiry developing for cows to fatten, but suitable cattle are being bought to kill at fair prices making it hard for restockers to compete."
"With a few more cattle available and a big improvement in quality, there were some good lines of feeder steers, yearling heifers and cows. With no heavy steers or bullocks yarded, and only a few medium quality bulls. Restocker cattle were short supplied following some good rains in the area at the end of the previous week.

The usual buying orders were present and a steady market price resulted. Feeder cattle, restocker cattle and yearling heifers showed little price change. There was a strong contingent of restocker from local areas in attendance, but there were insufficient suitable cattle available to satisfy the demand.

Bulls and cows provided the only export cattle quote possible, but the cows sold at steady rates for the slightly better quality offering. The bull prices showed little change but their yield potential was severely limited. Export weight feeder steers met a strong demand and competition from restockers was responsible for a slight price rise."
"With a bumper Spring almost guaranteed there was a reduction in numbers. It was a very mixed quality penning that featured a few high quality feeder steers and very good heavyweight cows. There was a reduced gallery of buyers with a couple of the larger processors not participating.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with the lightweight yearling steers mostly dearer under strong restocker competition. Quality was a factor in the dearer prices for the heavyweight yearling feeder steers with the overall trend also showing improvement. Reduced competition on yearling heifers saw all but a few selected pens sell to cheaper trends.

Well finished grown heifers experienced little change while there was some local restocker competition on the plainer conditioned lots. There were a lot less cows in the market with this factor contributing to an improvement in average quality . Market trends firm to dearer however the high price cows were not quite as good as the sale toppers from the previous sale. There was strong competition on the better heavyweight bulls with the market showing some improvement."
"With a break in sales coming up due to Easter, numbers increased by 745 head. Cows, vealers and yearlings made up the bulk of the offering. There were limited numbers of well finished grown steers or heifers. Overall the quality of the offering was fair to good and there were some well finished cattle scattered throughout. Most of the regular processors were in attendance and there was extra feedlot competition, one looking exclusively for straight Angus steers.

Trends varied through the young cattle with lightweight vealer steers to restock selling substantially cheaper. Breed and overall quality were a major contributing factor in the price reduction. There was little change in the market for medium weight lines with Angus steers attracting a premium. Less restocker competition saw vealer heifers sell to a cheaper trend, down 2c to 20c/kg on average. A lack of finish saw those to the processors also cheaper. Well-bred medium and heavy Angus yearling steers were well sought by both feed lotters and paddock buyers with large premiums paid for suitable lines. Heavy feeders averaged 15c/kg dearer. The secondary quality light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold firm to slightly cheaper. Yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend, both to the trade as well to restock and feed. There was some quality related prices change evident.

Quality also contributed to cheaper prices for heavy grown steers. A large penning of cows with big numbers of plain condition cows being offloaded prior to the onset of cold conditions expected through winter. Market trends through all classes were firm to slightly dearer with quality accounting for some change."
"Widespread beneficial rain reduced the original booking from 1110. Quality was fair to good with most descriptions represented. Heavy vealers and trade weight yearling steers were the exceptions. Quality in the cow yarding was well above the previous week. Feeder and yearling steers were in fair numbers with a slight improvement in quality noted.

The rain was responsible for a price improvement in almost all categories. Feeder steers and restocker yearling steers were in strong demand with lighter weight steers creating most interest from restockers. Yearling heifers to slaughter recorded a considerable price rise after some weeks of a falling market. A few pens of very light calves attracted strong bidding from both restockers and wholesalers, with most going to restockers. 

Heavy steers and bullocks were in limited numbers with no younger steers available. Prices remained firm to marginally dearer. Cow prices rose significantly with the top price of 159.6c/kg the best price seen for some time. Bull prices and export heifer prices remained fully firm.

A single light C2 heifer vealer at 229.2c/kg achieved top price of the sale."
"Wet weather restricted the numbers yarded. The quality was fairly plain with export cattle in low numbers.The bulk of the yarding was again weaners and vealers and yearlings with finished cattle again short supplied. There were fair numbers of heavy steers off oat crops yarded, but no bullocks were available. The quality of the cows yarded was plain and numbers are expected to remain low until mid summer.

One yearling buyer was out of the trade market this week, but the market was not affected with store cattle and vealers and yearlings all meeting a fully firm market. Demand for restocking cattle remains strong and is unlikely to alter as the yarding reduce and particularly if the rain keeps coming.

The fair numbers of heavy steers yarded met a good reception with restockers and feedlots bidding in competition with slaughterers. The cows in the yarding were plain enough in quality, but due to the shortage of numbers and the buyers need to keep up the kill they sold to a slightly dearer trend of 2c to 3 c/kg. Bulls were better yielding and sold to a slightly dearer trend."
"Wet weather hampered supply, and there was a limited number of cattle offered. Grown cattle were best supplied, with cows and bulls making up the bulk. The quality of the young cattle was plain, with most returning to the paddock, and a few went to a feeder order.

Light heifers to the restockers sold from 380c to 419c/kg. Well-bred steers to the feeders which lacked condition, reached 379c/kg. Yearling heifers to a restocking order sold from 284c to 305c/kg. A few 2 tooth heifers to feed made to 328c/kg.

Cows were firm with the 2 score medium weights reaching 230c and the better supplied heavy 3 and 4 scores reached 255c to 266c/kg. Heavy B muscled bulls ranged from 265c to 270c/kg."
"Wet weather forced a large reduction in numbers. There were reports of up to 15 inches of rain within 50km east of the town. The small offering was best represented by vealers and cows, with all other categories in limited supply. As to be expected with the small yarding processor attendance was restricted. Restockers, however, were still active. The quality of the penning was only fair.

Steer vealers to restock averaged slightly cheaper; however, this was more quality than anything. Heifer vealers attracted good support from both restockers and processors, with the light weight restockers up to 22c/kg dearer. The medium weight vealers to process were up to 11c/kg dearer. The limited supply of yearlings sold at cheaper rates, with competition restricted. 

There were insufficient heavy steers to quote. The cow market suffered due to a lack of processor competition selling to a cheaper trend, down 13c to 19c/kg. Restockers were active on a line of PTIC aged cows."
"Welcome falls of rain on the Tablelands in the past week resulted in a reduction in the number of cattle yarded.  Young cattle made up a large percentage of the yarding, with weaner steers and vealer heifers well supplied.  There was a good number of yearlings especially the heifer section.  Cows were well represented, while grown steers and heifers were in limited numbers.

Quality of the young cattle was generally good with some good runs of well-bred cattle offered.  All of the weaner steers went to restockers and sold mainly unchanged, while vealer heifers struggled to hold firm.  Feeders and restockers acquired most of the yearling steers at mainly unchanged rates.  The better-bred yearling heifers were keenly sought after by restockers with mainly the well finished 3 score heifers going to the trade.

The yarding of export cattle was dominated by cows with a few pens of grown heifers and an odd steer.  Quality of the cows was mixed with 2 and 3 score cows well represented.  The market ranged from 2c to 5c/kg dearer."
"Weaners and heifer vealers made up a greater than usual percentage of the yarding and there were bigger lines offered. Quality was quite good but possibly the steer portion were not quite up to last sale standards. It was also obvious that the heifer vealers were carrying a little more condition than the steers. Feeder cattle, trade cattle and bullocks were again short supplied but cows were again in big numbers.

Market trends in young cattle varied widely but steer weaners to restockers sold between 10c and 20c/kg cheaper under a much more restricted demand. There were exceptions amongst the better steer weaners, but not many. Heifer vealers met a very keen demand to finish 4c to 6c/kg dearer, all going to wholesalers. Feeder steers and heifers sold at firm rates for the best bred, but were cheaper for plainer cattle. There were very few trade yearlings yarded but values were well maintained.

The few bullock lots sold at firm rates for younger cattle while the best cows sold at slightly dearer prices and all other cows were steady. There was no change in the bull price. Odd singles in heavyweight export heifers met a keen enquiry to sell at firm prices."
"Very poor seasonal conditions and a lack of water saw numbers increase to 1,140 head. The quality and condition of the offering was generally plain and consisted of large numbers of lightweight yearlings and cows. There were limited supplies of good quality well finished cattle available. Processor competition was restricted however surprisingly, there was strong demand from restockers with a break in the season. Market trends varied with most of the young cattle selling to a dearer trend, while heavy cows and bulls sold to a cheaper trend.

The market saw quite a few young calves sell on a dollar per head basis with prices very strong. A few pens of good quality light and medium weight C2 vealers sold to a dearer trend of 20c to 30c/kg, with restockers purchasing the majority. Plain quality lightweight yearling steers to restock were as much as 30c/kg dearer. Medium weight C muscled lines improved 11c/kg. There was a fair supply of heavy feeder steers in the penning which met a lack of competition, to sell at prices below other recent markets. Strong restocker demand saw lightweight yearling heifers sell to a dearer trend of 5c to 11c/kg, with quality variations accounting for some other price change.

There were not enough heavy grown steers to quote. Quality variations accounted for some large price changes in the grown heifers, with the market generally cheaper. The odd well finished heifers remained firm. Strong demand from restockers saw light weight cows show a much dearer trend. Medium weight plain condition cows sold to a cheaper trend, with those attracting restocker competition least affected. Well finished medium and heavy cows sold to a much cheaper market trend this week, down 15c to 30c/kg. The best of the heavy bulls were down 3c to 5c/kg."
"Very heavy rain overnight saw road closures North of Armidale, and some Buyers couldn't  get to the sale, probably having some downward effect on values of export cattle. Quality was again a little improved with most grades represented. Demand for young cattle was strong and values across the range were 2 c/kg dearer. Export cattle, both bullocks and cows, however, were cheaper by 2 c/kg on greater numbers than last sale. Restock steers met strong demand to be 2 to 3 cents dearer, with very few selling under 90 c/kg."
"Very good rain over the past few days reduced the yarding to only 440 head. Most rainfall reports from producers in the drawing area were in the vicinity of 60mm. Cows and bulls dominated the offering with very few yearling steers or heavy steers available. The quality was mixed with limited numbers of well conditioned cattle, apart from cows. Most regular buyers were in attendance.

Yearling steers sold firm with overall quality the only variation, with all being in the light weight category. Restockers were also active on the heifer yearlings with the better quality grades selling to a dearer trend, up 10c to 15c/kg. The plainer quality grades also improved in value to a lesser extent. Trade yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend although numbers were scarce.

The grown cattle market was solid. Heavy steers sold firm to 1c/kg dearer. The better shaped C muscle grown heifers sold firm to 3c/kg cheaper, while the plainer D muscle grades sold to a dearer trend as processors looked to fill their requirements. Plain condition cows sold to a slightly cheaper trend with some sales firm. The better condition 3 and 4 score cows were up to 2c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls sold to a cheaper trend."
"Vendors produced a slightly smaller yarding with a very wide variation in quality. The biggest numbers yarded were very lightweight yearling cattle, both steers and heifers, and all of then suitable for restockers. Cows were well supplied and most were medium to heavier weights while there were only a few bullocks available. Trade cattle were again in limited supply but export heavy heifers were in fair numbers.

The numbers of local restockers trying to by stock to handle the excess feed, were greatly increased, the result being a price structure 15c to 25c/kg dearer. The heifer portion of the light cattle were dearer by an average of 5c/kg. The few tradeweight cattle yarded were fully firm as were the few pens of feeder steers. Feeder heifers were heavily supplied and they sold at fir to slightly dearer prices under a strong enquiry.

Export heifers and the lightweight manufacturing cows were firm in price but there was a cheaper tendency in the medium to heavy cows. The bull prices remained unaltered. Cows and calves suitable for restocker were represented by seven pens and they sold to a top price of $1320/head"
"Vealers, yearlings and cows were well supplied in a slightly reduced penning. The quality of the offering varied with quite a few plainer condition cows alongside a line of good quality heavy vealers. There were also some good quality light and medium weight vealers penned. There was a similar line-up of processors in attendance. Restockers were particularly active on the better quality young cattle and cows.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with the well bred and good quality weaner steers in all weight ranges remaining firm. The secondary quality and some of the crossbred steers sold to a cheaper trend and accounted for much of the reduction in price change. The heifer weaners to restock sold to a cheaper trend with again the straight bred and better quality lots least affected. Heavy yearling steers to restock and feed were significantly cheaper with reduced competition. Medium weights were firm to cheaper. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers sold to a dearer trend. The medium and heavy weight feeder heifers averaged 11c to 17c/kg cheaper with some of that fall quality related.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. Well finished grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend. Medium weight cows experienced little change with restockers competing strongly with processors. The heavy cows to process were 7c to 11c/kg cheaper."
"Two days of soaking rain reduced the offering with many vendors adopting a wait and see attitude. Quality was very good with most descriptions well represented except for heavy steers and bullocks, and shop trade vealers. Feeder steers and restocker yearlings were in fair numbers with a noticeable improvement in breed quality. 

Values for most types of young cattle improved with lightweight vealers and trade heifers averaging a 5c/kg rise. Export weight feeder steers and restocker yearlings met increased competition for a dearer price range, while feeder heifer demand strengthened to provide a dearer market of between 8c/kg and 15c/kg 

There were only a few sales of heavy steers and bullocks but indications were for a dearer market trend. Export heifers met a very keen demand and most sales averaged 8c/kg dearer. With not all export works back in operation, cow prices varied. Heavy cows were firm but isolated sales were to 5c/kg cheaper, while lighter types were to 3c/kg easier. Bulls were fully firm.

The op price in the sale was an estimated 256c/kg paid for steer vealers sold at $366/head to a restocker."
"Total numbers were small, with yearlings making up a large percentage of the penning. There were a few heavy steers, grown heifers and cows. Overall the quality of the cattle was fair to good and condition showed improvement. The regular processors were in attendance along with a small gallery of restockers.

Lightweight yearling steers remained firm, the lower price average was more to do with weight than trend with improved condition carrying extra weight. Medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, up 18c/kg. Yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend with decreased restocker demand. The well finished 3 score heifers to the trade carried more weight than the previous week.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend, up 10c/kg, with grown heifers also selling to a similar trend. The cow market continued at strong levels, dearer by 1c to 8c/kg."
"Todays reduced numbers were caused by some vendors uncertainty about whether to sell now, or wait until after the Christmas break.  The quality of the offering was unchanged from the previous sale.  The majority of the yarding were yearlings and cows,  with store steers also yarded in fair numbers.  All the usual and regular buyers attended the sale.

The market for all young cattle, including the very light calves, was fully firm.  Restocker yearling steers met with very keen bidding, with a number of prospective buyers leaving empty handed due to a lack of numbers and high prices.

The export cattle met strong competition, with prices remaining fully firm for all grown steers, cows and bulls."
"Today was another very small penning, with light weight young cattle making up the bulk of the offering. There was a single pen of well finished heavy milk and 2 tooth steers and very few cows or grown heifers. Processor competition was limited, however restockers were very active on light weights. Given the lack of supply, there was little in the way of market comparisons through some categories.

Light weight weaners to restock sold to a dearer trend with the steers up to 10c/kg cheaper and the heifer portion improving by 30c/kg. There was some quality related price change however. Light weight yearling steers to restock remained firm. A lack of competition for those carrying more weight resulted in a cheaper trend. Plain quality and condition light weight yearling heifers to restock remained firm. As with the yearling steers the better quality heavier heifers sold to a cheaper trend due to a lack of competition.

The single pen of heavy steers saw the price up to and equal with other local centres. There were insufficient cows in each weight class to make a market comparison."
"Throughput remained steady despite no sale for 2 weeks. Vealers made up half the yarding along with a fair supply of cows. There were a few heavy grown steers and some very good heavy yearling heifers. A full complement of processors was in attendance and there were a good number of restockers as well. The quality of the offering varied with some good quality vealers, well finished heifer yearlings and heavy steers as well as a mixed condition offering of cows.

Comparing to the previous sale held 2 weeks ago the market for steer vealers to restockers was cheaper, down 6c - 10c/kg. There was not as much demand for the heavier weights. The cooling of the weather and sheer weight of numbers coming forward over the next 2 months quite likely to be a contributing factor. The cheaper trend carried through to the heifer vealers for much the same reason with prices down by a similar margin. Yearling steers to restock and feed also sold to a cheaper trend with little competition from feedlots. Heifer yearlings were cheaper with the well finished heavy heifers less affected than the plainer condition light and medium weights.

The few heavy grown steers experienced little change in the market. This trend was also evident in the cow market, with prices similar to those of the sale 2 weeks ago. The short weeks behind them saw processors actively sourcing supply for the full working weeks ahead."
"This was the smallest yarding for many years as growers wind down towards the Christmas break and this being the last sale for the year. Quality was very plain and they were mainly yearlings, with a few cows and calves, suitable for restockers. Restockers bought the bulk of the offering.

The few pens of restocker yearling steers sold at slightly dearer prices while the balance of the young cattle were considerably cheaper, mainly due to the lower quality of the yarding. There were local restockers keen to buy replacement cattle but the breed quality was not good enough for most of them.

There were no bullocks or export heifers yarded and the few cows available sold at cheaper rates under limited competition on the run up to the break."
"This was the last sale prior to the Christmas break, following the cancellation of next weekâ€™s market. Numbers increased by 500 head and included a good supply of young cattle and cows. The quality of the offering was fair to very good. There were a number of pens of well finished heifer yearlings and some very good cows. A small field of processors operated, however local restocker activity was high after a very good recent rainfall event.

It was a very strong market throughout, where any negative price changes were due to a change in quality and breed composition. Calves and vealers to restock were 18c to 40c/kg dearer, with the steer portion showing the greatest increase. Yearling steers to restock and feed in the light and medium weight categories were 14c to 18c/kg dearer, and more in places, although there was an easing trend in one class due to breed. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed attracted keen demand from both restockers and feedlot orders. The feedlot orders were particularly keen to purchase forward condition heifers. The market trend was up to 22c/kg dearer, with an isolated sale to restockers showing a greater increase.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. The cow market was very strong, with good restocker support on plainer condition lots. Heavy weight cows were 13c to 14c/kg dearer, with light and medium weights showing greater improvement."
"This was the last sale for the year and sales will recommence on the 5th January 2012. There was an increased number on offer with both young and grown cattle well represented. The quality of the penning varied considerably with this particularly evident in the yearling steers. There was a limited supply of well finished yearlings with most suited to restocker or feedlot purposes. There were some very good cows once again. All regular buyers were in attendance.

A limited number of vealers were penned with steers to restock selling at dearer prices. The average quality of the yearling steers on offer played a part in prices, with averages cheaper. The good quality lightweight steers of suitable breeding to restock actually sold firm to slightly dearer. Breed quality was the major factor in the cheaper trend for medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed. Heavy yearling steers to both the trade and to feed sold to a dearer trend. There were variable trends for heifer yearlings with lightweights to the processors and restock firm to slightly dearer. Medium and heavy trade heifers sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c/kg.

Heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, down 5c/kg and the trend for grown heifers was close to firm. There were some very good cows penned, however overall the quality was down slightly. Taking this into account there was little change in the market while a large offering of heavy bulls were up to 7c/kg dearer."
"This was the largest offering of the year so far with numbers increasing by more than 1000 head. There was a large offering of vealers with all other grades well represented except for heavy steers and grown heifers. The quality of the yarding was mostly good with the condition varying. The bigger numbers brought extra restocker orders to a market that saw most grades firm to dearer.

Vealer steers to restock sold to a dearer trend, up 7c to 9c/kg. This trend carried through all weight classes. Heifer vealers sold to processors slightly cheaper, down 2c to 4c/kg. Those to restock and feedlot orders remained firm under increased competition. Lightweight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend with quality also down a bit. The medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed attracted very keen demand to show a dearer trend of 1c to 9c/kg. Heifer yearlings sold mostly firm with quality only affecting average values.

The limited number of heavy steers sold to processors at firm rates. Feeder steers with 2 or more teeth sold dearer. The average quality of the grown heifers was below the previous sale, the market however remained firm. Plainer condition 2 score cows sold firm. The 3 and 4 score cows sold to a cheaper trend, down 6c to 8c/kg and more in places. Heavy bulls were firm to cheaper."
"This was the biggest sale held in Armidale for at least the last eight years with the dry weather and the approach of what may well be a dry winter being wholly responsible for the sell off. Male cattle were in the greatest numbers followed by yearling and weaner cattle with cows only lightly supplied for such a big yarding. Restocker steers were mostly of inferior quality.

Demand for feeder cattle was restricted as two major operators were not active due to a flush of cattle across northern sales this week. Restocker demand also weakened due to the dry weather. The market for the better steer weaners were firm while most other young cattle sold at cheaper rates that averaged between 6 and 10c/kg. Feeder steers lost between 8 and 15c/kg under a weaker enquiry. A few pens of best trade heifers were treated to a little more respect and sold at close to a firm price.

Bullocks and heavy steers were well supplied but demand weakened and a cheaper price regime dominated with falls of 8 to 10c/kg being very regular. The heaviest and the medium cows were cheaper by a similar amount but the lighter cows met a little more competition to sell at firm to 4c/kg cheaper. Best in the bull market was firm but plainer types lost considerable value.

The top sale price was 215.2c/kg paid by a restocker for older but lightweight steer weaners."
"This was one of the smallest sales on record in a reflection of the very good seasonal conditions and high level selloff during the drought. Yearlings made up the bulk of the offering along with some very good heavy grown heifers and cows. The quality was mostly good and condition fair to excellent. There was a limited gallery of buyers, however demand from all sectors was high.

The high demand for young cattle resulted in dearer trends throughout. Only quality and breed had any negative effect on price change. The lack of supply having little effect and reflecting supply levels through the industry.

Despite a small number of processors in attendance, market trends for the grown cattle were firm to dearer with some improvement for quality in the cows. Bulls experienced little change."
"This time of year always equates to big numbers in the New England and there was no exception with the biggest offering to date. There were not the expected numbers as a few producers hesitated at sending booked cattle in light of the big offering. The numbers brought in a few extra outside buyers. There were plenty of vealers, yearling heifers and cows penned. The condition of the yarding reflected the onset of winter with the majority of the offering lacking finish.

The young cattle market was generally cheaper, although odd grades experienced a firm to slightly dearer trend. Heavy vealer steers to restockers and light and medium weight heifer yearlings to feeders sold at firm to slightly dearer rates. The extra buying strength was certainly a factor with the heifer yearlings. As the winter closes in restockers are looking to purchase bigger vealers in preference to the lighter weights. The light restocker vealer steers and the heifer vealers lost all of last weeks gains, the steers cheaper, down 5c to 15c while the heifers were down 17c to 20c/kg. Yearling steers to restockers were cheaper as were the trade yearling heifers, down 15c/kg.

Increased numbers of grown cattle met a cheaper market, heavy steers 7c/kg down. The medium and heavy cows to processors lost ground, down 8c to 13c/kg. There was good competition for the light plain conditioned cows with little change in the market trend. The biggest offering of bulls for some time also met with a cheaper trend."
"This sale was scheduled in the off week to avoid clashing with Easter. There was a greatly reduced supply with quality and condition very mixed. All categories were represented however there were not many straight lines. There was a reduced buying presence with the lack of numbers contributing to that.

There were not many positive market trends through the young cattle where quality was a factor. A small number of weaner steers to restockers remained firm while the heifer portion were cheaper. Yearling steers to restock and feed were considerably cheaper with quality the lack of supply and restricted competition factors. The market trend for yearling heifers took the greatest hit with prices for all those going to restock and feed significantly cheaper.

Heavy grown steers sold to cheaper trends. A small number of well finished grown heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend. There was little change in the cow market when taking quality into account."
"This sale saw the start of the autumn selling season, with a considerable rise in numbers and in particular a heavy rise in weaner numbers.These numbers and above are expected to last until mid June. 

It was fairly obvious that the weaners are being sold at a lower body weight than in some other years, an indication that vendors are selling a little earlier to take advantage of the current strong market price.

The quality of the yarding can only be described as plain for condition with cows and a few pens of light bullocks the only true fat stock offered.

The usual buyers were in attendance and the bulk of the yarding of weaner and yearling steers went to restockers at fully firm prices.There was no sign of a reduction in demand for replacement cattle.

Heifer vealers and yearlings went mostly to slaughter at prices unchanged from last sale. Some pens of heifer veal were quite well covered but those types remained in the minority.

The bullocks again were in demand and sold at slightly improved levels even though quality was not at the top.

There were some numbers of high yielding cows yarded and demand for them was equally as strong as it has been recently in most other centres with the prices received being unchanged."
"This report compares to the previous sale of two weeks ago. Numbers increased as the season continues to dry and quality across all descriptions was good. Most types were represented and numbers of male cattle of all weights increased considerably. Vealer and weaner numbers are starting to increase as the time of the year approaches when weaner numbers are at their peak. Cows were poorly represented but young and older bullocks were in fair supply.

All the usual buyers were in attendance and the trend in the market varied from firm to cheaper, while heavy steers and bullocks were the only cattle to show an improvement in price. Weaner steers to restock sold at firm rates while heifer vealers, yearling heifers and most feeder steers sold at slightly cheaper rates. Trade steer sold at firm prices and yearling steers to restockers showed little variation. 

There was wide variation in heavy steer and bullock prices. Most were from 5c to 7c/kg dearer, but there were some sales recorded at up to 10c/kg dearer. Export heifers sold at firm rates, but all cows were an average of 3c/kg easier. The bull price was also cheaper by an average of 3c/kg. 

Top price in the sale was 210.6c/kg paid by a restocker for quality steer weaners."
"This report compares to the last sale on the 19th of December. Breed quality was quite good but prime cattle were short supplied while restocker cattle dominated the numbers. Light calves to restock, yearlings and grown heifers were in the greatest percentages while the few bullocks available were three score fat cover only.

An exceptionally strong demand for restocker cattle was the major feature in the sale but all cattle prices rose considerably. There were plenty of light calves and yearlings bought by restockers that increased in price by up to 20c/kg, while all young slaughter cattle also registered big increases in value. Feeder steers were in strong demand and met a dearer market for all weights.

The few bullocks available needed more time to fatten properly but they sold to a dearer trend nevertheless. The cow price also reflected the current shortage of supply with prices well above the closing Christmas market. Another feature was the 143.2c paid for a pen of four heavy cows and 147.2c/kg for a single sale, with that price not having been achieved since the early part of last year.

The top sale price of 170.2c/kg was paid by a restocker for a pen of medium weight steer calves."
"This fortnight saw the numbers almost double. Vealers, yearlings and cows made up the bulk along with another good penning of bulls. There were small numbers of well finished heavy grown steers and heifers. Overall, the quality of the offering was fairly mixed with some well bred young cattle alongside some very plain lots. The usual processors were in attendance. Restocker demand was very high with green feed the main driver.

Market trends through the young cattle were generally dearer, however the low numbers at the previous sale make some market comparisons difficult. The demand for light weight steers was very strong resulting in record levels being achieved for restocker vealers. The demand was just as high for the heifer portion, however pricing levels were not as high. Plainer quality light weight yearling steers also attracted strong demand, representing a lower dollar outlay. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to dearer trends with strong gains posted. Good quality yearling heifers to restock and feed saw a significantly dearer trend. There was some breed and quality related negative price change though the yearlings.

No market comparison for the few heavy grown steers. Increased demand and an improvement in quality saw the well finished grown heifers sell to a dearer trend, up to 9c/kg. Restocker orders were plentiful through the cow market with some very good quality store cows penned. This resulted in dearer trends for those returning to the paddock. The small number of plain condition cows purchased by processors were also dearer. Well finished cows to processors saw a firm to slightly dearer market trend, some variation in quality. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"There were very few prime stock yarded and the bulk of the market consisted plain conditioned cows and calves, light weaner and yearling cattle, together with good pens of medium cows and three score bullocks. Just over 20% of the yarding comprised cows and calves, most of which were light in condition and the calves were young.

The usual buyers were in attendance; however it was the restockers who dominated bidding. Light weaners and yearlings which suited the restockers only, sold at fully firm to slightly dearer prices with the restocker demand far outstripping supply. Wholesalers purchased a number of pens of better conditioned young cattle at firm prices.

Cows and calves sold to restockers in a range of $530/head to $1,140/head on a rising market caused by the recent valuable rainfall. Medium weight bullocks lacking sufficient finish, sold at firm prices as did the pens of light to medium weight cows. There were very few heavyweight cows available. Heavier export heifers and bulls were dearer by almost 5c/kg.

The top price of the day was 234.2c/kg paid by a wholesaler for light heifer vealers."
"There were very few fat stock in a similar sized yarding where the bulk of the cattle weighed under 300kg liveweight. Most of the male cattle yarded were suitable for restockers, and there were good lines of weaner and yearling heifers, the bulk of which were bought by wholesalers. There were only 63 cows in total, and no heavy steers or bullocks. Overall, the yarding could only be described as plain.

Restocker demand reached a peak for the current season, following beneficial rain in the weekend. All restocker cattle, particularly very light weights, sold at dearer rates. Heifer vealers, weaners and yearlings sold at steady prices under a keen enquiry. There were only a few pens of yearling steers suitable for slaughter, but the demand from restockers dominated the bidding.

There were no bullocks or heavy steers to quote and the small offering of cows sold at firm prices. Feeder steers were fully firm to slightly dearer under a strong demand, but there were few export weight feeders available. The bull market was to 10c/kg dearer.

The top price of the sale was an estimated 288c/kg sold in dollars per head, and paid by a restocker for steer weaners that were weighed at 127kg."
"There were some very well bred cattle in the bigger yarding with weaners, vealers and yearlings very well represented and offered in bigger lines. There were more tradeweight heifer yearlings yarded and cow numbers continued to escalate in the face of growing seasonal problems. Yearling steers were almost universally bought by feedlots with the few lots which might have gone to the trade, being bought by restockers.

A strong field of buyers bid for the young cattle and the market trend was fully firm or dearer. Restockers bought all the weaners yarded at fully firm rates while restockers were mainly responsible for a 5c/kg rise in the price of heifer weaners and vealers. There were more trade heifers yarded and they sold at fully firm to slightly stronger values. Domestic weight feeder steers were keenly sought after and therefore sold at an average of 5c/kg dearer.

The very few bullocks and heavy steers sold at firm rates and heavier export feeder steers were dearer under keen competition. There was strong demand for lighter weight manufacturing cows and values were 5c/kgt dearer with the major demand coming from exporters. Medium and heavyweight cows were fully firm as were the bulls."
"There were some very well bred cattle available, mainly in yearlings and weaners, together with a few pens of well fattened young bullocks and trade cattle. Cow numbers were down and their quality varied widely.  A percentage of the yarding was again very plain, lightweight and reflected the worsening season in many parts of the district.

There was a very strong demand for all types of cattle with restockers very active on younger steer weaners and yearlings, even though that market remained very steady. The heifer vealers and the heavier feeder heifers sold at a dearer trend of 8c to 10c/kg while the few trade pens were also dearer. Many of the younger cattle are approaching the 12 months of age mark and have been weaned for some weeks; this is reflected in the condition of the cattle.

Demand for bullocks strengthened and the improved quality saw the best cattle rise in price by up to 10c/kg. Heavy high yielding cows sold at a similar elevated plain, while lighter cows were dearer, but not too the same extent. There were heavier muscled bulls yarded and they sold to dearer rates."
"There were some surprisingly well finished cattle yarded considering the current weather pattern, but generally it was an obviously drought affected yarding. The yarding was similar to earlier weeks in that the bulk of the cattle were cows, mostly boners, light calves, and plainer conditioned yearlings. Trade cattle were very short but the bullocks yarded were well finished and had been crop fed. Restocker yearling steers and feedlot cattle were not in the usual numbers.

Not all the usual buyers were active and the market trend, almost without exception, was much cheaper. Most affected were light calves, some of which last up towards 40c/kg from last sale values. The cattle least affected were the better bred feeder steers while plainer quality types were very much cheaper, as were the restocker yearling stock.

Bullocks were cheaper but their price loss was not as extreme as in some other types. Light cows varied between 10c and 20c/kg easier with the price struggling throughout the sale to maintain even that cheaper rate. The better yielding cows were an average close to 20c/kg cheaper, with the rising Australian dollar rate being quoted as having a considerable price affect. The bull price was well down on last sale as was the quality generally.

Top sale price was paid both for light bullocks and heavy trade yearling steers."
"There were some numbers of very early steer weaners yarded together with some good lines of feeder steers and a variety of cows. Light bullocks were moderately well supplied while trade heifers varied considerably in quality and weight. Restocker yearling steers were also in fair numbers as were the older export weight heifers. All the usual regular buyers attended the sale.

There was plenty of demand for all cattle with the enquiry for restocker and feeder steers showing a considerable lift. There was a cheapening in the price of the very light vealers which were mostly heifers but they were the only cattle to record a fall. The heavy end of the trade heifers sold to a dearer price while light feeder steers and restocker steer weaners also sold to a stronger market.

The demand for bullocks increased with prices for all weights dearer by 7c/kg. The cow and heavy export heifer markets were fully firm while the bull price remained static under very steady competition.

The top sale price was 219.6c/kg paid for light steer weaners going to a restocker."
"There were some good quality fat cattle and weaners yarded, but the tail end of all types were a little plainer in condition. Cows made up one third of the total yarding, while weaners were in fair numbers and the steer portion was better quality and quite well grown. Trade weight cattle were in slightly bigger numbers while heavy steers and bullocks were still in low supply.

The market for many types of cattle steadied for the first time for some weeks with heifer vealers, trade heifers and plain steer weaners selling at firm to marginally dearer prices. The best quality steer weaners to restockers sold at a dearer rate under intense demand. Very few yearling steers were bought by the trade, but prices did no better than remain firm.

The best of the light bullocks were fully firm, however any that were in lighter condition sold to a cheaper trend and that included most of the feeder steers. The cows sold at dearer rates for all but the heaviest weights with buyers keen to buy both the light and medium cows and that little extra enquiry made the difference. There were many less heavy heifers available. The bull market lost some value with one less buyer operating.

Top sale price was 179.6c/kg paid by a restocker for best quality steers weaners."
"There were some good falls of rain in the area over the weekend but the yarding size remained steady. The quality, though, was well above the last sale on almost every type of cattle. Cows were well supplied as were restocker steer weaners and yearlings, while restockers snapped up most of the yearling steers that would normally go to the feedlots. Trade cattle were not well supplied while there were only two pens of quality bullocks available. 

Therer was plenty of competition on all types of young stock with a very evident increase in price on all restocker cattle and on the heifer weaners and vealers to slaughter. The demand from local restockers for light cattle was keener than it has been for some time, with the season in most local parts having now consolidated. Trade cattle prices remained fully firm.

The prices on the bullocks and older heifers remained steady but the big price rise was seen on all classes of cows. Most varied between 8c and 15c/kg dearer, but with the heavier types the yield was much better, and that accounted for a percentage of the price rise. Restockers again took an active role in making the pregnant and lighter cows dearer.

Restocker steer yearlings topped the sale prices, with 199.8c/kg having been paid for quality medium weights."
"There were some better quality cattle in the market with vealers and weaners in good numbers. Feeder steers were also well supplied while there were also some fair quality heavy steers and bullocks available. Cows were in short supply and their quality was fair only. There were once again very few trade heifers yarded and all the trade weight yearling steers were bought by feed lots and none went to slaughter.

The demand for steer weaners to restock and heifer vealers to slaughter was well sustained with price increase available for the better types and a very firm market for the rest. Yearling off feeder steers sold in a very narrow price range that varied from 179c and up to 187c/kg irrespective of quality change. Restocker steer yearlings were again in fair numbers and well sought after. Trade heifers were short supplied but sold at firm rates.

The bullocks sold well but only just managed to reach the prices of the last sale, however there was a demand for better bullocks had they been in the yarding. The cow market was consistent at last sale rates but there were not many high yielding cows yarded. There was also a strong demand from restockers for store cows to fatten but there were very few suitable cattle yarded.

Restockers paid the top price for steer weaners that sold at 218.2c/kg."
"There were some better cattle yarded in trade heifers and cows and heavy steers and bullocks while quality was stable in feeder steers and heifers and the very lightweight vealers. Demand was again strong for all classes of cattle with the usual buyers in attendance.

Demand for feeder heifers and therefore for the trade heifers have improved very considerably during the past week. With a major demand for feeder heifers coming out of Queensland, the market was dearer than the previous week and the trade heifers, which share that competition showed equal rises in price. The demand for feeder steers was very steady and the price remained very much firm. There were no yearling steers bought for the local trade market. Restocker demand was very keen for the very light weight yearlings.

The heavy steer and bullock demand improved with a reasonable rise in price being the result. There were a few pens of excellent cows yarded which topped the market by virtue of their very high yield, but generally the cow market was unchanged. There were only plain bulls yarded that sold to a fully firm market.

The top sale price was 254.2c/kg paid for very light vealers to kill."
"There were slightly fewer cattle penned for the last sale. The quality was mixed with condition on the plain side. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering with all other grades represented. Not all regular processors were in attendance, however an extra  buyer turned up to make up the shortfall. Restockers were well catered for in a market that showed a dearer trend through most grades.

There was a much improved quality offering of lightweight vealer steers that attracted strong restocker demand, the market showing a 20c/kg improvement. The heifer portion sold firm. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold firm to 10c/kg dearer, particularly for the lightweights. Heifer yearlings to restockers and feeders also sold firm to dearer with overall quality down a little.

Grown steers suitable to feeders sold to a dearer trend as did the small number of heavyweight steers. The majority of the cow offering lacked condition, with this attracting strong restocker demand. The market for the plain condition cows showed a dearer trend, up 3c to 17c, while the better condition cows to processors was firm to 2c/kg cheaper."
"There were similar numbers yarded at Armidale today with most of the young cattle up to last sale quality. Heavy steers and a few pens of bullocks were yarded, there being none available last week. The bulk of the yarding was again light vealers and yearlings with the strong market of last week for veal under 200kg being responsible for an increase in their numbers. Cows were yarded in greater numbers, but there was an obvious falling away in quality and therefore yield. The buying power was the same as last week and the general market trend was once again firm to dearer.

Most of the young cattle bought by butchers and wholesalers sold to a considerably dearer trend as has been the case in recent sales. The outstanding market increase was seen in the restocker, yearling steers of a light weight over 220 and under 300kg. With store steer prices at high levels there appear to be more growers going home empty handed than there are those buying. The very light heifer yearlings are also reaching new price levels weekly.

The heavy steers and light bullocks were generally not well finished, but they sold at similar rates to two weeks ago, there being none available last week. The cow market again strengthened under sustained competition with prices higher than at any time in the last four or five years."
"There were similar numbers to last week with a good selection of young cattle, cows, a few heavy steers and a good supply of bulls. All regular orders were in place to operate on a fair to good quality offering. All destinations were well catered for.

Given recent trends the young cattle market was quite good, albeit a lot of it showing a cheaper trend. The light and medium weight vealers to the trade were 8c to 10c/kg cheaper. Yearling steers, most of which went to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend, down 8c to 14c/kg with quality also adding a bit. Overall the quality was not quite as good. There was quite a bit of competition for yearling heifers to go to the paddock and feed pens, the market firm to 3c/kg cheaper. An isolated pen of very good quality heifers slightly dearer. Yearling heifers to the trade remained firm with quality the only variation.

The quality of the heavyweight steers was reasonably plain with the best showing a full mouth. All grown steer categories showing a cheaper trend. Grown heifers also sold to a cheaper trend, the best down 1c to 2c with the secondary grades up to 7c/kg easier. The cow market was good with little change evident on the slaughter cows. Restocker cows sold to a cheaper trend, although quality was not as good. Heavyweight bulls sold firm for the best and cheaper for the secondary lots."
"There were similar numbers this sale, with a larger penning of weaner steers and yearling steers in the majority. There was only limited processors present, due to lack of numbers in the cow offering .There was, however, good demand from feeder and restocker operators.

Light weight steer weaners sold to 540c/kg, however the trend for that category tended to the cheaper side. Conversely the heifer portion sold to dearer trends of 26c, selling to 441c/kg. Yearling steers, both light and medium weights sold to dearer trends, the light steers to 474c, the medium drafts to 27c/kg dearer. A limited yearling heifer offering sold to significantly dearer trends.

No grown steers or heifers to quote. Medium weight trade cows saw a cheaper trend of 13c/kg, with limited competition available. Heavy cows eased 15c, however, store cows held value to see a dearer trend of 13c/kg. Bulls in excess of 1,000kg made to 277c/kg."
"There were similar numbers penned, however the overall quality of the offering was below that of last week. Vealer numbers continue to rise with in excess of 30% of the offering off the cow. Cows and yearlings were also well represented although heavyweight steer numbers were well down. All regular buyers were in attendance.

Vealer steers, all of which went to local restockers sold to a dearer trend, up 2c to 10c/kg. Vealer heifers also sold well with both processors and restockers active. Medium and heavyweights sold firm to 4c dearer. The lightweights in numbers sold cheaper, however numbers brought a greater variation in the overall quality.Yearling steers sold firm to cheaper with quality the major contributing factor. Heifer yearlings to the trade remained generally firm with restockers paying slightly dearer rates.

Heavy steers sold very close to firm on a plain quality offering with grown heifers following a similar trend. Plain condition cows sold at slightly dearer rates under both restocker and processor demand. Medium and heavy 3 and 4 score cows remained generally firm but were down a little on quality. Bulls were dearer."
"There were reduced numbers offered, with the quality and condition of the offering generally plain. There were limited supplies of well finished cattle available to processors. The same processors were in attendance and there was extra restocker competition.

Competition from restockers was strong through the young cattle with steer and heifer vealers selling to a dearer trend. Light weight yearling steers to restock were 5c to 20c/kg dearer and more in places taking quality into account. Medium weights to restock also sold to a dearer trend. Light weight yearling heifers to restock experienced greater price increases than the steer portion. The limited supply of good quality light and medium weight heifers also sold to a dearer trend. 

Heavy grown steers saw little change. Plain quality grown heifers sold to a dearer trend with restockers active. There were quality related price changes in the cow market, with trends firm to dearer for the most part."
"There were reduced numbers of vealers, yearling heifers and cows penned in fair numbers. The quality of the offering showed quite a bit of variation as did the market. All regular buying orders were in place.

Variations were evident throughout the young cattle grades. The best restocker steer vealers sold firm to 3c dearer while the balance of the vealer steers sold to an cheaper trend, down 3c to 4c/kg. The heifer vealer market saw the general run sell to a cheaper trend, down 8c to 17c/kg. The best heifer vealers sold at unchanged rates. The quality of the yearling steers dictated the market with plainer quality steers selling at cheaper rates, once again the best quality cattle showing little change. The bright spot in the sale were the yearling heifers to feed on; they sold to a dearer trend, up 2c to 6c/kg. Trade yearling heifers remained firm.

Heavy steers sold firm to dearer although the quality improved on last week. There was a cheaper trend evident through all cow grades. The light cows sold at rates 5c to 10c/kg cheaper. Middle weight cows sold cheaper, down 4c to 5c/kg cheaper and more in places with the heavy cows most affected cheaper by 10c to 12c/kg and more in places."
"There were reduced numbers and the offering showing good selections of vealers and weaners. Yearlings and cows were also well represented. The quality and condition was fair to good with some very well finished heavy steers and some pretty handy cows. All regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market was generally firm to dearer although there were odd grades showing a cheaper trend. The vealer steers to restockers sold firm to a fraction cheaper. The cheaper sales were isolated. There were very few steer vealers suitable to the trade. The better quality heifer vealers sold firm to dearer, with odd sales up 2c to 6c/kg. The lightly muscled heifers, also lacking yield sold to a cheaper trend. The yearling steer grades experienced little change in the market trend, odd quality variations though. There were a few restocker orders about for yearling heifers, this pushed the market for heifers along with the market trend firm to dearer both trade and feeder buyers.

The improved quality offering of heavy steers contributed to a dearer trend, up 3c to 5c/kg, supply issues also contributing. The cow market also experienced a firm to dearer market through all grades. The rise was 2c/kg with an odd sale of better quality cows slightly more."
"There were only a small number of cattle penned for the first sale of the New Year. A wide variation in quality was evident through all classes. There were some very good quality young cattle, both vealers and yearlings alongside quite a few plain quality lots. There were no good heavy steers to speak of, however there were some good cows. The usual processors were in attendance while demand for cattle to restock and feed was very high.

Comparing trends to the last sale prior to Christmas vealers to restockers were 30c to 40c/kg dearer through both the steers and heifers. Yearling steers to restock were up to 22c/kg dearer with the heavy feeders experiencing stronger gains. Similar trends were evident through all classes of heifer yearlings.

The cow market was also much dearer under limited supply and high demand with prices improving by 20c to 30c/kg. The bull market however was cheaper."
"There were only a few well finished cattle in the market but the store cattle were reasonably well  bred types. Weaners were in greater numbers than last sale. Trade cattle were again in low numbers with only just an odd lot of steer yearlings that went to slaughter. There were very few bullocks yarded but older steers were in fair numbers but quality was down. There were only two or three pens of good, high yielding cows. The balance were plain and mostly light weights. It was very obvious that the very low temperatures recently received have had a very sudden and negative affect on the condition of the local cattle. 

The trend in the market was firm or cheaper with no cattle showing any price improvement. Heifer weaners and vealers to slaughter and steer weaners to restock stayed at last sale rates. The better trade heifers and yearling feeder steers also stayed firm. Plainer bred yearling steers were cheaper as restocker and feedlot buyers are tending to discard cattle below a certain quality level.

There were not enough bullocks yarded to provide a reliable quote. Heavy steers were in fair numbers but the greatest majority were either badly bred of unfinished and they therefore sold to a cheaper market. There were only a few pens of high quality cows which were fully firm on last sale. The majority were plain and very low yielding and they sold to a much quieter demand to be up to 6c/kg cheaper. After a good run of bulls in earlier weeks there were only a few bulls yarded.

The demand for feeder steers out of saleyards and the demand for export weight cattle has steadily dropped in the last few weeks due to the heavy supply at most feedlots and abattoirs. That situation may continue for a few weeks until numbers are cleared."
"There were only 655 cattle yarded, heralding the beginning of the normal winter shortage of numbers. The quality was plain only, most types were represented, but only by small numbers. Most of the better finished cattle met a firm market, but all other descriptions were a little cheaper. Bulls were an exception, showing a few cent rise. The vealers and weaners are finished for the season, just as the restock demand is falling away in the face of the dry weather."
"There were only 280 head penned with the offering comprising of a large percentage of light weight weaners and yearlings. There were limited supplies of grown cattle. The low numbers saw limited processor competition with only 2 export processors in attendance. In contrast restocker activity was high. The quality of the offering was very mixed and there were few well finished cattle available.

With little sales activity over the past 2 weeks no market comparisons are available. The current level of the cattle market combined with the certainty of a very good season and lack of supply saw light weight weaners steers set new c/kg price records for this centre. The heifer portion also sold very well. Light weight yearling steers and heifers lacked quality and condition in most cases and taking those factors into account, prices paid were well up to those in other Northern centres.

Grown heifers to restock, attracted good competition selling strongly, although for the most part showed only average weight for age. The few cows penned sold at levels similar to other sales, as did the bulls."
"There were only 183 head penned as producers hold off from selling stock, with what can only be a very good spring, just around the corner. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering, while bulls made up in excess of 10% of the penning. The quality and condition of the cattle was the plainest seen for some time. There was limited processor activity with few cattle to suit.

Restockers were active, looking to stock paddocks going into the spring. The quality of the offering, both breed and breeding had a large influence on prices with all but the very light weight Angus steer yearlings selling to a cheaper trend. 

The small number of plain condition cows sold to restockers at dearer prices. The better quality heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend, while the plainer bulls were cheaper."
"There were not a lot of prime cattle in the market, but there were good numbers of cattle just short of the mark. Heifer weaners and yearling heifers made up the bulk of the offering, but there were also reasonable numbers of weaner and yearling steers suitable for restockers. Trade steers were in short supply as were quality shop trade vealers, while both bullocks and cows were in reduced numbers.

Demand for all young cattle was stronger as numbers became more difficult to source across the state. Light heifer vealers and trade weight yearlings sold at dearer rates averaging 8c/kg, while restocker demand pushed all weaner and yearling steers up by a similar amount. There was also a stronger enquiry for all feeder cattle, particularly medium to heavyweight steers. Feedlot buyers were quite prepared to pay a considerable premium for best quality types.

Heavy steer and bullock prices did not vary from the rates set last week, but quality in the small offering was generally only average. Odd single sales of high yielding cows were slightly dearer, but with the exception of restocker demand, all slaughter cows were firm. Demand for bulls improved with isolated sales recording up to 10c/kg increase.

The top sale price of 218.2c/kg was paid by a restocker for a pen of quality light steer weaners."
"There were more light vealers yarded with the recent strong prices responsible for the increase in numbers yarded. Cow and feeder heifer numbers were steady but there were less trade cattle and less heavy steers, bullocks and feeder steers available. Generally, the quality was similar to the previous sale.

With just a few exceptions, the market was cheaper even though all the usual regular buyers were in attendance.  Light vealers, either steers or heifers, met strong competition from both abattoir buyers and from restockers, and their price structure was unchanged. Feeder heifers were cheaper by 4c to 5c/kg as were the restocker yearling steers. Most of the feeder steers in the market were the heavier export type and they sold at cheaper prices. Trade cattle were also cheaper by up to 7c/kg.

The biggest price reductions in the market were in the export oriented cattle, with heavy heifers losing up to 10c/kg from their value. Heavy steers and bullocks, while not in big numbers, were cheaper in the range of 7c to 13c/kg, with an odd pen of four tooth and older cattle, cheaper by 20c/kg. All cows suffered a very sudden price fall, with the average drop being 10c/kg and the greatest price loss being 13c/kg. Bull values followed the same trend. 

The top price of the day was 240.2c/kg paid for a pen of European cross steer vealers estimated to weigh 220kg."
"There were more cattle yarded this week, consisting mainly of young cattle and a small penning of cows.  Quality was fairly mixed, with all the young cattle going to restockers at stronger prices following the rain.  Restocker vealer steers were up 20c, toping at 177c, while restocker vealer heifers gained 10c, toping at 155c/kg.  Restocker yearling steers were up to 20c dearer, with well-bred light weight selling to 205.2c/kg.

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows, with insufficient numbers of steers and heifers to gain a reliable quote.  The cow market met a firm to dearer trend, with a consignment of pregnancy tested cows attracting strong restocker demand."
"There were more and better cattle in the yarding at Armidale today with the quality quite good for a small offering. There were good pens of well bred store weaners and yearling steers available. Some light heifer vealers and light trade yearling heifers attracted attention. The heavy steers and bullocks were yarded in a fairly high percentage of the total and they were mostly sufficiently well fattened off oat crops. Cows were again short in numbers and there were no really high yielding types available. A big yarding of 65 bulls met keen competition.

The usual buyers attended and bid strongly on the young cattle, while there was some restriction of bidding on some export cattle. The export steers were obviously better quality than last sale and they sold well at prices equal to the improvement in yield. The demand for these better cattle is evident, but the supply of ideal cattle is severely limited.

The cow market continues to strengthen, but again supply continues to reduce, even though the market is so strong. The high yielding types amongst the unusually heavy yarding of bulls met very strengthened demand and they sold at much stronger rates compared to the last quality yarding two weeks ago.

The market for store weaners and yearling steers shows no sign of being satisfied in the near future. With the signs of an early spring in the air, restockers seem to feel under increasing pressure to replace cattle sold through the winter, even though prices are so far ahead of this time last year."
"There were mainly young cattle yarded and condition was plain.  Heifers were a large percentage of the yarding. There were only 10 plain grown steers and a few pens of cows.

Restockers and processors competed on the young cattle, with restockers particularly keen to make purchases, with the promise of a decent spring.  Lightweight vealer steers purchased by restockers reached dearer levels selling to 245c/kg.  Lightweight vealer heifers met a strong market, with both northern processors and restockers competing. Trade yearling heifers sold 4c/kg cheaper.

Not all the usual export orders were active due to the low numbers available.  The cows were mixed and had some restocker support and average values displayed little change.  Grown heifers were fairly plentiful and they sold to a top price of 175c/kg."
"There were limited numbers of quality cattle yarded leaving a below average yarding of mainly weaners and yearlings. The only cattle bought by abattoirs were a few pens of cows, one pen of bullocks, two or three pens of trade heifers and a good number of heavy bulls. The balance of the cattle were bought by restockers and feedlots.

Most of the young cattle sold at firm rates but there were a few pens of feeder yearling heifers, which sold at slightly easier rates. With the prospect of rain in the air, local restockers were very keen to buy weaners and yearlings, but mainly the lighter weight cattle. Domestic weight feeder steers were possibly the best quality cattle in the yarding and they sold at slightly dearer rates.

The few bullocks yarded were older types, which sold at fully firm prices as did the limited number of cows, most of which were plainer quality than usual. There were some good heavy bulls available and they sold at dearer rates by up to 8c/kg."
"There were less weaners and vealers in the market but most other cattle were fairly well supplied. There were greater numbers of cows yarded and there were some high yield cows amongst them. There were basically no bullocks yarded but heavy steers were in fair numbers. Feeder steers were also well supplied but the lines on offer were bigger than usual.

There were some price losses amongst the weaner steers and the heifer vealers but the losses were less extreme than in the last two weeks. The very large number of weaners and heifer vealers that have been recently sold in the North have restricted the market price as supply is now outweighing the available demand. Any quality bred young steers are selling at a firm price but off types were cheaper again. The trade heifers lost some ground and there were no trade steers that went to slaughter.

There is no bullock quote due to the lack of numbers and that is the first time in very many weeks. The better heavy steers sold at firm rates but off types again were cheaper. The cow and bull markets continue to maintain their recent levels in every category. Restockers are having some affect on the market and are competing strongly for better quality medium joined cows.

Top price of the day was 196.2c/kg for a good pen of yearling steers bought by a local restocker."
"There were less than half the numbers of the previous sale, with rain and follow up forecasts restricting supply. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering with limited supplies of grown steers, heifers and cows. The quality and condition of the young cattle was mixed, with the majority purchased by restockers and feedlots. There were a few small lots of high quality, well finished, heavy grown steers and heifers. Demand varied throughout.

When comparing market trends to the sale 2 weeks ago, restocker demand increased on the back of improved seasonal conditions. The heifer vealers returning to the paddock sold to dearer trends, up to 14c/kg in places. Yearling steers to restock and feed also sold to dearer trends, with quite a large price variation depending mostly on breed and quality. Medium weight feeder steers were as much as 28c/kg dearer. Light weight yearling heifers experienced strong gains in places and once again breed was a major factor. The limited supply of medium weight feeder heifers sold to a slightly cheaper trend.

There was no market quote available on the heavy grown steers, with nothing to compare them too from the previous sale. Well finished grown heifers saw a firm to cheaper market. There were cheaper trends through the cow market, while reduced buyer participation saw the bull market cheaper."
"There were less than half the number of cattle penned this week. Of that number there were in excess of 150 young calves. The quality of the offering was generally plain. Condition was also plain apart from a few cows and grown heifers. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Keen demand from restockers saw the young calves sell to a much dearer trend, up to 50c/kg more, with the quality contributing also. Market trends through the yearling steers and heifers were generally firm to dearer, however there was some quality related price change.

Strong processor competition for the well finished grown heifers resulted in a much dearer market trend. The plainer quality and condition heifers attracted restocker and feedlot competition to also record strong gains. There were dearer trends through the cow market. The plainer condition light and medium weights displayed an improvement in quality. 3 and 4 score cows sold to a dearer trend of 4c/kg under strong processor competition. Heavy bulls were significantly dearer with a vast improvement in quality."
"There were less than half of last week's numbers with all categories reduced in the offering. Cows were particularly affected, as the number offered declined by 60%. Most grades saw dearer trends, with processors, feeders and backgrounders looking to procure their needs.

Weaner steers sold to upward trends of 22c/kg. Heifers saw rises of 11c/kg to the trade .Yearling steers to backgrounder and feeder buyers saw a dearer trend of 14c/kg. Plainer quality steers saw a rise of 18c/kg. A variation in the quality of medium weight steers saw prices ease 4c/kg. Heavy heifers eased 8c/kg on the top end, with quality an issue once again.

There were not many grown steers or heifers to quote, however, steers increased 10c/kg, while heifers sold to a dearer trend of 8c/kg. Light 2 score cows saw a price rise of 12c/kg, with dearer trends experienced in the plainer types to lift averages. Similarly, the plainer heavy category cows sold to a dearer trend of 21c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to a slightly dearer trend of 4c/kg."
"There were just a few more cattle yarded but little improvement in quality. Weaners and yearling cattle were well supplied and there were a number of high yielding cows yarded.  Apart from these the balance of the yarding of restocker cattle, were not up to the standard of quality from the previous sale.

Demand for all young cattle stayed very strong with the numbers of restocker orders increasing as the spring flush of feed approaches on the Tablelands. Yearling steers to restockers showed little variation but the plain and light heifers weaners and yearlings were 5c/kg dearer. Trade yearlings were short supplied and sold at firm rates.

The few bullocks available were older but sold at firm prices. Heavy heifers, all cows and bulls were in strong demand and sold at unaltered rates."
"There were just a few more cattle in the yarding and there was a big improvement in the quality of the export cattle. Some pens of heavy bullocks and dry cows were extremely well finished with high yield potential. The trade cattle were few in number, with trade heifers showing fair quality. There was only one pen of trade steers yarded.

The best of the tradeweight heifers sold at slightly dearer rates, while the lesser quality heifers struggled to remain firm.

All export cattle met a very strong and consistent market with heavy steers, medium and heavy bullocks, and all cows, selling at considerably higher levels, the quality rises were complemented by increased demand."
"There were increased numbers to wind up sales for the year. Overall the quality of the offering was the best seen for several months, even with the greater numbers. Cows, heavy steers and yearlings were well supplied. All regular buyers were in attendance along with some increased trade and feeder competition. Restockers were once again very active.

Restockers were the major force on yearling steers. The market showed a dearer trend for all categories. The light steers saw rises up to 10c with the medium and heavy grades seeing a trend firm to 8c/kg dearer. Both trade and restocker interests competed strongly for the heifer yearlings. Lightweights were firm to 8c dearer with the medium weight grades showing a dearer trend, up 8c to 10c/kg. There were increased numbers of heifer vealers, most good quality. They met keen demand from processors, the result a dearer trend of 6c to 15c/kg.

The heavy steer offering included a very good quality line-up, the market was firm. The story was the same with the grown heifers fully firm. Cows met keen demand, mostly from processors with the market showing a dearer trend, up 2c to 7c on the medium weight grades and 5c to 6c/kg for the heavy grades. Bulls were the only low spot in the market selling to a cheaper trend, down 11c to 13c/kg."
"There were increased numbers as the cold weather sets in. The quality and condition of the yarding was variable throughout all grades. There were a few pens of well finished cattle, although the majority of the yarding was showing the effects of the cold weather. All regular buyers were in attendance, although some did not operate to full capacity.

Like the quality, the young cattle markets saw some variation. The best quality cattle sold at firm to slightly dearer rates, particularly vealer and yearling steers. The plainer quality cattle struggled to maintain last weekâ€™s rates. Vealer and yearling steers to both restockers and feeders were firm to 8c dearer for the better quality with the plainer quality grades 8c to 10c/kg cheaper. Heifer vealers were 5c to 6c cheaper for the better quality, with the plainer descriptions 6c to 8c/kg cheaper. Yearling heifers were 1c to 9c/kg cheaper.

The grown cattle offering saw a reduced quality offering of heavyweight steers selling to a firm trend. Quality however caused a slight drop in values. A reasonably bright spot were the cows, the plain cows sold to a dearer trend, up 2c to 6c/kg with restockers showing some interest. The medium and heavyweight processing cows sold at rates firm to 1c/kg dearer."
"There were a number of very well bred cattle in the yarding, but well fattened cattle were in lower numbers and plain and light cattle were in the usual numbers. Yearling heifers and cows were the greatest supply with the cow numbers rising sharply compared to last week. All other descriptions were reasonably well represented. Feeder steers were of better breed quality and they were fairly well supplied.

There was again considerable strength in the market with all descriptions either dearer or fully firm. There were not great numbers of light veal in the yarding but their market price continues to rise sharply. Trade heifers and feeder steers and restocker steers met very strong demand and sold at fully firm prices. Restockers are very keen to buy cattle particularly light steers but the supply is very limited at the moment. There were no yearling steers bought to slaughter.

Heavy steers and light bullocks to slaughter met a very keen demand mainly from Queensland exporters and they showed up slightly dearer on a marginally better type of steer. Cows sold well considering the extra numbers yarded and most were a few cents per kilogram dearer. The bull market was dearer but a certain amount of the rise was caused by the higher yields available.

The top price was 274.6c/kg paid for light steer vealers to slaughter."
"There were a number of pens of well bred cattle and cattle showing good finish, but generally quality was plain. Weaners, vealers, cows, feeder steer and heifer yearlings made up by far the greatest percentage of the yarding. The steer weaners were not up to the usual standard of breed quality while there was also a drop in the standard of the yearling steers. The better cows were limited to seven or eight pens, while the balance was mainly medium to lightweight.

A good number of buyers attended but there was a considerable variation in the market trends of young cattle. The best weaner steers and yearling steers to restockers were firm, but the plainer end was cheaper. Best feeder heifers were 2c to 3c/kg dearer and the plain end were cheaper by a similar amount. The good quality heifer vealers met keen demand and remained fully firm in price.

There were hardly enough younger bullocks to quote a market, but the export heifers met strong demand and remained fully firm. Cow prices struggled to stay at last weeks sale rates, while the bull and export feeder rates were unchanged."
"There were a few more pens of fat yearling heifers yarded but generally it was a plain offering. Restocker steers and heifer yearlings of poorer condition made up the bulk of the yarding. Cows were in fair numbers but they were not quite as well fattened as in recent weeks. One major operator was not in attendance.

Trade cattle which consisted of mostly 2 and 3 score sold to firm rates. Restocker grades again met strong enquiry to finish firm.

There were not enough grown steers or bullocks yarded to give a reliable market quote. The cows sold at 2c to 3c cheaper, however some of that loss was caused by a drop in quality. The medium type bulls were in fair numbers and sold with little price change."
"There were a few more cattle yarded this week, at 1050 head.  The quality was plain,  but unchanged. All the usual buyers attended.  The better finished trade cattle were only in light numbers for steers,  but well represented in yearling heifers. Only a few pens of heavy steers and bullocks were available, but there were a good number of cows in the yarding.

In keeping with recent trends, the values were dearer in the yearling cattle of all grades, with the heifer yearlings rising the greater percentage. Restock yearling steers sold to dearer trend, but there were only a few pens yarded.

Cows showed a healthy price increase as did the heavy steers and bulls,  while export feeder steers sold at more encouraging values, though only in small lots."
"There were a few more cattle penned, mostly young cattle with an even spread of vealers and yearlings. There were a number of pens of young cattle that had been weaned and were categorised in the yearlings. The overall quality of the offering was mixed, with a few well-finished young cattle, most however were suited to restockers with a small number going to the trade. There were a few heavy grown steers, but not many well-finished cows. A full field of processors were in attendance and restocker demand was high.

Competition for young cattle returning to the paddock was strong, resulting in most trends being dearer. Vealer steers to restock were up to 9c/kg dearer on the lighter weights, with the heavier end close to firm. Quality variations accounted for any other price change. Vealer heifers to processors were slightly cheaper, while those to restock were up to 5c/kg dearer. Demand for yearling steers to the paddock was very strong, with light and medium weights selling to a dearer trend. The inclusion of the weaned steers helped to lift average prices, while secondary quality steers saw the best of the increase. Heavy yearling steers to feed were slightly cheaper with restricted competition. Yearling heifers to restock sold to a dearer trend, with lightweights up to 9c/kg dearer. There were too few to the trade to quote a trend.

The few heavy grown steers saw prices cheaper, with age and quality contributing factors. The cow market was dearer, with plain conditioned lightweights showing strong gains under restocker influence. The medium and heavy cows improved by 1c to 5c/kg."
"There were a few more cattle in the market this week, quality better on the yearlings and heavy steers and bullocks, and similar quality in the 160 cows on offer. With such a good season on the Tablelands slowing down the supply,  the shortage of restock and finished yearling steers is now quite obvious. Growers are apparently attempting to value add with young steers.

Yearling steers, 2 and 3 score, sold up to last sale's mark, but as in other centres, heifers lost some ground. Restocker steers were firm, the only price change, caused by quality variation.

All export type cattle sold at firm rates, with the cows varying in value,  but still, basically firm as were the greater numbers of heavy bulls."
"There were a few less numbers throughout, with a slight increase in yearlings and a similar cow offering. Quality overall improved, particularly cows that saw considerable increases. Restocker competition saw cow grades improve for the lighter drafts, while the trade responded to the improvement in quality of the heavy cows. Young cattle quality also improved, conversely, there were still large numbers plainer heifers on offer and these categories saw mainly cheaper trends. All the regular operators were present, along with an extra store cow order and some local restocker activity on the weaner cattle.

Light weaners to restock saw dearer trends of 14c to 18c/kg. The offering of some plainer quality heifer weaners saw cheaper trends of up to 30c/kg. Good quality steer yearlings to feed sold to dearer trends of 30c, as did medium weights, also up over 30c/kg. There were drafts of lesser quality yearling heifers offered, the lighter drafts to feed back 11c, while the medium weights were back 9c to 17c/kg to restockers.

Heavy steers to the trade were 10c better, while the heifers to the trade saw dearer trends of 20c/kg. All cows saw an increase in trends, with light D1 cows up to 19c/kg better. D2 categories saw prices increase 6c to 13c, while D3 and D4 cows sold to rising trends of 20c/kg. An average bull offering saw cheaper trends throughout."
"There were a few less cattle this week, but the quality of all but the better few of the young stock and the cows was plainer than usual. All the usual Buyers were in attendance and the market was fairly regular throughout, with a dearer trend on trade cattle with finish, and also on a few pens of the heaviest cows and the odd pen of 2 score yearling steers to restockers. Most of the balance of descriptions stayed at last sale rates, but there was a definate weakening in the plain grades of 2 score calves.
      
The restock demand still remains strong, but the enquiry is now centered on the best quality with demand for plain weaners dropping off."
"There were a few less cattle this week, at 580 head, the quality was mostly unchanged, except for an improvement seen in the trade yearlings. The bulk of the yarding was made up of yearlings and cows, some off oat crops, most of which are cutting out in the continuing dry spell.

The market was again strong for all fat stock with the best trade cattle dearer, along with heavy steers, light bullocks and cows. All the other cattle including restock steers remained unaltered."
"There were a few less cattle penned with light yearlings making up a large percentage. The overall quality of the offering was mixed with few well finished lots available. The regular processors were in attendance alongside good restocker interest.

Light yearling steers to restock averaged cheaper on an otherwise firm to dearer market where quality was a factor in price change. A line of very light weight steers sold up to 7c/kg dearer. The trend was the same for medium weights which were carrying more weight than the last sale. Light heifer yearlings to restock sold to a firm trend with averages higher due to improved quality. Heavy trade heifers sold dearer also.

All grown steers sold to a restocker with lightweights dearer, while steers heavy steers sold cheaper. The penning of cows was very mixed in quality. Plain condition cows attracted restocker competition with the market firm to 3c/kg dearer. Cows to process realised little change, the exception being a single high yielding cow that was 5c/kg dearer."
"There were a few better cattle yarded at Armidale today with the bulk of the yarding consisting of grown steers and restocker steers, weaners and yearlings. Heifer vealers were of plain quality and very light weights while there were again very few cows yarded. There were just a few pens of medium to heavy bullocks available. The usual regular buyers attended and they had difficulty filling orders in a small yarding.

The trend in the market was firm to dearer with store steers either weaners or yearlings selling at fully firm rates. The very light heifer vealers and yearling heifers were a little dearer with the pressure on the market due to small numbers.

The few pens of bullocks were well finished and they sold at unchanged rates with the fat quality better than last week. The cows in the market were either very light or very good and the best yielding cows were 3c/kg dearer while medium and light cows were firm. There were better quality bulls available and the price rise shown was almost absorbed by that increased quality. Overall, the market was solid and consistent, which has consistently been the case in recent times."
"There were 690 mainly mixed quality cattle penned, similar to last week. Good numbers of weaners, yearlings and cows were penned along with numbers of light, plainer cattle. All the usual buyers attended.

Weaner steers showed a dearer trend on average, while the heifer portion was slightly cheaper. Both steer and heifer yearlings were dearer, with feeder buyers active in purchasing both classes. Plainer cattle showed a dearer trend.

Grown steers and heifers were in short supply, they were dearer, as were cows which showed an increase of up to 11c/kg for the better drafts, to average firm. Bulls were dearer."
"There were 580 head penned, and that number included a line of 400 yearling Angus heifers. They were of good quality and presented in store to forward store condition. The balance of the offering was fair to good. There was restricted processor competition.

Excluding the Angus heifers quality affected prices for restocker and feeder cattle with the market trend cheaper. The Angus heifers attracted strong competition from buyers looking to purchase future breeders as well as those looking for finishing purposes. They attracted premiums over other yearling heifers of 10c to 30c/kg.

The restricted processor competition saw all slaughter cattle sell to a cheaper trend, with well finished cows up to 27c/kg cheaper."
"There were 300 fewer cattle with the majority of the offering showing the effects of cold weather and a drop in feed quality. The quality of the offering was fair to good with condition only fair. There were very few well finished young cattle with cows making up the biggest number of 3 and 4 scores. All regular buyers were in attendance for what was a solid market.

Vealer steers to restockers continue to defy the onset of the cold weather with the market for the good quality cattle remaining firm. Buyers were a bit more discerning in relation to breed quality with some of the crossbred and less desirable breeds selling at cheaper rates. Heifer vealers sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 6c with restocker orders placing pressure on processors, particularly on the 2 score lots. There were some good restocker orders for yearling steers to go onto supplementary feed, particularly for the medium and heavyweight end. This resulted in a dearer market for restocker and feeder steers, up to 9c higher. Trade yearling heifers saw the market 4c cheaper on the medium weights while the best of the heifers sold up to 6c dearer. Good quality heifers to restockers and feeders also sold firm to dearer.

There were insufficient heavyweight steers to quote while grown heifers remained firm. Plain condition cows sold to a cheaper trend, down 2c to 3c. The better condition cows experienced little change. Overall the quality of the cow offering was below last week."
"There were 2720 cattle yarded before any rain fell, so that this yarding should be described as dry weather caused. Quality was similar to the last week, with some pens of finished stock in all classes, but still plenty of unfinished cattle were offered.

The rain over the last two days caused some cancellations elswhere, and three extra buyers attended. Vealers averaged 5 to 6c/kg dearer, with most of the steers going to restock. Best heavy trade steers and heifers averaged 6c dearer, with odd sales improving 12c.

Heavy steers and light bullocks were in strong demand selling up to 15c dearer for heavyweights, but averaging 8c dearer.

Cows were again in good numbers, enquiry was keen and values were 2 to 5c/kg dearer for most. Demand for heavy muscled bulls was particularily strong."
"There were 1307 head penned, down 600 week-on-week. Young cattle and cows were well supplied with limited numbers of grown steers and heifers. The quality of the offering was fair to good and there were some well finished vealers and yearlings on offer. Most of the regular processors were in attendance and the same restocker and feeder orders were in place. There was also some extra restocker competition.

Demand for steer vealers from restockers was high, particularly for well bred lines of the sought after breeds. The market trend was dearer with medium and heavy steers averaging 4c to 10/kg dearer. There were some highly sought medium weights that saw price gains of 23c/kg. Heifer vealers to the trade sold to a dearer trend, up 5c to 13c/kg. Heifer vealers to restockers were slightly cheaper. There were some very good quality medium and heavy yearling steers suitable to the restocker and feeder orders, the market trend was firm to 10c/kg dearer. Heifer yearlings also sold to a dearer trend with some showing significant gains, while others saw quality related price changes.

The quality and condition of the heavy grown steers was a factor in the cheaper prices. There was little change in the cow market except for some to restockers. The lift in odd sales was quality related and yield influenced."
"There were 120 cows and calves in the yarding, together with a numbers of yearling steers and heifers mainly suitable for restockers. There were 65 cows yarded and a number of quality export heifers, no bullocks, and very few vealers available. Overall the quality was similar to the previous sale.

The usual buying orders were represented but there was a variation in values on young cattle. Restocker suitable steer yearlings were cheaper by 5c/kg while yearling heifers to restock or slaughter were fully firm. There were only two lots of very lightweight vealers yarded and they sold at marginally cheaper rates.  Restocker demand was more limited than in any of the previous six sales.

No heavy steers were yarded. Cows and heavier export heifers were firm. Bull prices were also firm, but a reduction in demand from restockers saw cows and calves generally sell at $100/head cheaper than the previous sale. The cow and calf price varied between $550 and $1085 per unit."
"There was steady soaking rain throughout the Armidale sale today with the numbers slightly improved. Quality was marginally better with the bulk of the yarding made up from light yearling heifers to slaughter and yearling steers, all of which went back to restockers. Heavy steers and light bullocks were quite well finished, but were not large in numbers, while export heifers were in greater numbers than usual. There were no vealers available.

The wet weather encouraged a stronger market with light yearling heifers between 220 and 300kg showing a marginally dearer trend. The yearling restocker steers also sold at dearer prices with the rain providing growers with a guarantee of quality feed well into the future months. Trade heifers were scarce, but the best of them sold at firm rates and there were only a few trade steers available.

The heavy steers and bullocks were again in demand, but sold at equal rates to last sale, while the cows were in fair numbers and they sold well to record slightly higher prices.

The bull demand showed a definite weakening with the secondary types losing as much as 6c/kg, while the few of the very best were 2c and 3c/kg cheaper."
"There was reduced numbers in a penning consisting of a fair supply of good quality medium weight yearlings and some very good heavy cows. There were a few heavy grown steers and a number of plainer quality light yearlings. Processor and feedlot activity was reduced however restocker activity was still high. There were varying market trends, with quality changes also affecting prices in some cases.

Light and medium yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, with some sales of better quality cattle up to 20c/kg dearer. Heavy yearling steers remained firm. Light yearling heifers to restock were firm to cheaper, with quality a factor in the lower prices. Good quality medium weights were up to 10c/kg dearer.

Heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend of up to 10c/kg, with quality contributing. The cow market also sold to a cheaper trend, with the best of the cows up to 8c/kg cheaper. Despite restricted restocker activity the plainer condition cows were only slightly cheaper."
"There was quite a variety of cattle yarded this week, though most types of cattle were yarded.  The bulk of the offering were vealers and weaners with a fair percentage of good cows available. Yearling steers were also available in fair numbers.  Bullocks were in greater numbers but the majority showed a lack of finish with growers having taken them as far as possible on a reducing feed supply.

There was a price weakening on some young cattle with under fattened and plainer bred cattle the most affected. Price reductions in the order of 2c to 4c/kg were common on heifer vealers and plain bred weaner steers and yearling heifers.  The best young cattle stayed at similar prices to last sale.

There was a lift in the bullock prices despite the lack of finish with a 2c/kg rise being fairly common.  The better of the cows yarded were far above the last sale in quality and yield.  The market was fully firm for all descriptions with seven or eight pens of the very best cows selling to a dearer trend.

Feeder and restocker steers sold well again with demand equal to previous sales and prices very much the same as in recent weeks."
"There was quite a remarkable drop in the size of the yarding, with growers appearing to anticipate the rain which fell during the night. Quality and condition was again plain with the bulk of the yarding being cows, weaners and yearlings. The cows were mainly in very light condition. There were no bullocks yarded and very few heavy steers.

The market trends were again variable with steer weaners of the best quality selling at firm prices, while some plainer bred cattle were cheaper. The demand for the better cattle strengthened following some handy over night rain. Heifer weaners and yearling heifers sold at cheaper prices although the quality was not up to the standard of last week. There were very few trade cattle available although there were plenty of potential buyers present. 

There were insufficient heavy steer yarded to frame a market. All cows to slaughter sold at cheaper rates, but the smaller framed and plainer conditioned cows were keenly sought after by restockers with most pens selling at slightly dearer prices. The bull price weakened with less competition available. Feeder steers were plain breed quality and sold at cheaper prices across all weights.

The best price realised was 197.6c/kg paid for light weight steer weaners bought by a restocker."
"There was quite a dramatic improvement in quality in almost every category following a number of sales where the average quality was well below normal. Almost every category except trade weight yearlings was well represented. Restocker yearling steers were also in short supply, however the number and quality of the bulls was well above recent offerings.

All the usual buyers were attendance and there was also a strong contingence of local restockers. The trend in the market, with few exceptions, was firm or dearer. There were a few pens in all the young cattle categories which sold at dearer rates, but generally young cattle were fully firm. A few pens of heavier yearling heifers, and the restricted numbers of trade steers, sold at dearer prices under a strong demand which was not satisfied due to a shortage of numbers.

Demand for export cattle again strengthened with the bullocks increasing by as much as 8c/kg.  Heavy export heifers were marginally dearer while cows rose by 2c to 3c/kg.  In one of the biggest offerings of quality bulls seen for some years, the average price rose by 3c/kg."
"There was only a small reduction in numbers, however the quality of the penning varied greatly. There was a fair supply of good quality vealers and yearlings however there were also quite a few secondary quality cattle penned with some showing little sign of the very good seasonal conditions being experienced across most of the region. There was a fair supply of well finished grown cattle. There was reduced competition from both processors and feedlots, however local restocker demand was high.

Market trends through the young cattle varied and quality variations were a major contributing factor in price change. Lightweight vealers to restockers sold to a dearer trend with premiums for the well-bred Angus and Angus cross lots. Heifer vealers to the trade sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Trends through the yearling steers to feed were generally cheaper as were those for the medium and heavy restocker steers. There were odd sales in the lightweight classes that were dearer, mostly breed related. Quality variations contributed to some large price falls. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed sold to a dearer trend, up to 9c/kg, while the balance of the heifers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend. Well finished heavy trade heifers sold to a cheaper trend.

The heavy grown steer quote included a single pen of milk tooth cattle that sold to the domestic trade at 263c/kg. The balance of the heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend. Heavy grown heifers also sold to a cheaper trend. Reduced competition saw the cow market sell to a cheaper trend with the better medium and heavyweights down 10c to 12c/kg."
"There was only a small increase in the numbers despite the 2 week layoff. As there are some very big weaner sales coming up and this may be a contributing factor. All categories were represented, however, mostly young cattle and cows. The quality was fair to good, while the condition of the offering reflected the variable seasonal conditions across the drawing area. There were some good lines of high quality, well-bred yearling steers penned and some very good cows. The usual processors were in attendance with a little less feedlot competition, this however, was replaced by additional northern restocker orders.

Market trends were generally cheaper through the young cattle. The quality of the weaners contributed to the cheaper prices with the better weaners being reserved for the specialist weaner sales. Both the steers and the heifers saw cheaper trends of 15c/kg and more in places with the plainer heifers most affected. The medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend of 3c to 6c/kg. Yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend, up to 17c/kg off the top prices from the previous sale 2 weeks ago.

The limited supply of heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, up to 10c/kg. The grown heifers were also cheaper with the plainer quality lots most affected. The highlight of the sale was the cows. They attracted strong processor demand and sold to a dearer trend of as much as 16c/kg."
"There was only a small increase in numbers. Vealers, yearlings and cows were well supplied. The majority of the vealers were more suited for restocking purposes. The overall quality and condition was mixed, quite a few showing the effects of the drought, while some of the cows showed no sign. The full field of buyers were back and operating and this had a significant effect on the market in some categories.

Steer vealers to restockers over 200kg sold on a firm to cheaper market trend, however an improvement in quality had a positive effect on price change. There was a large variation in the price range, mostly breed related. Heifer vealers and weaners sold to a dearer trend with averages improving by 12c to 13c/kg with the increased competition contributing. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw improvements of as much as 30c/kg with the increased competition from both feedlotters and restockers. The biggest gains were in the yearling heifers with the medium and heavy weights showing improvements of 50c to 60c/kg and more in places. There was some quality improvement also.

There were too few well finished heavy grown steers and heifers to quote. The cow market saw a dearer trend with the well finished 3 and 4 scores 11c to 13c/kg dearer, while the plainer condition cows and especially the very plain cows experienced greater improvements. The limited supply of bulls also saw the benefit of increased competition."
"There was only a minor change in the number of vealers yarded and in particular heifers were well supplied. Yearlings were in fair numbers and there was a good supply of mostly plainer condition cows. The quality of the offering was fair to good, however the condition reflected the seasonal conditions with more being of plain quality than well-finished. A full field of processors were in attendance, however not all operated. There were increased feedlot and restocker orders in place.

Varying trends throughout the young cattle section saw vealer steers to restock firm to slightly dearer. The trend was the similar for vealer heifers, however it was a little patchy at times. Medium and heavy yearlings, both steers and heifers, suitable to feedlot orders sold to a dearer trend, showing some strong price gains. Lightweight yearlings experienced little but quality related price changes. With feed supplies still very short, but green, there was renewed interest in the lower priced cattle to go back to paddocks.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. Well-finished heavy grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. Plain condition cows sold to a slightly dearer trend, with increased restocker competition. There were some quality related price changes. There was little change in the 3 and 4 score cow market."
"There was no sale in Armidale last week due to the Australia day holiday. The bigger yarding contained a much better quality run of cattle. There were some very good lines of feeder and restocker steers, some good pens of cows, and more of the good quality weaner and vealer cattle. There were very few bullocks or heavy steers, and the tradeweight cattle were also short supplied. 

A full field of buyers in all categories of younger stock saw the market dearer for most descriptions.  Restocker weaners and yearling steers were all dearer under keen competition, mainly from local growers. Trade cattle were also a little dearer while the yearling feeder steers sold to a 4c/kg average price rise.

With a much stronger demand for all export cattle, the few export heifers sold to 4c/kg dearer. The bullocks were mainly older manufacturing types which sold 6c/kg dearer. Light cows sold to a dearer trend with restockers assisting in pushing prices upwards by 5c/kg.  Heavier types were up to 9c/kg dearer, while the bull price was also improved. Heavier feeder steers were dearer by 4c/kg."
"There was many more restocker cattle yarded, probably as a result of the recent good rain with growers having an expectation of a dearer market. Weaner cattle and yearling cattle made up the bulk of the yarding with a few pens of medium type bullocks also yarded. Trade cattle were in light supply once again and their quality was plain.

The growers expectation was well founded with restocker steers in either weaners or in yearlings selling at considerably dearer prices along with the heifer weaners to slaughter. Trade heifers were also dearer by a reasonable margin.

The few pens of bullocks available were dearer by an average of 10c/kg for two to four scores. The light cows sold to a dearer trend while heavier types were also dearer but not to quite the same degree. The bull market remained firm.

The top sale price was 218.2 c/kg paid for a very small pen of restocker steer weaners."
"There was little variation in numbers but there were a few more pens of quality yearling feeder steers and some good pens of well fattened yearling trade steers. Cows were better yielding but the balance of the yarding tended towards the plainer side. Restocker yearlings were in limited numbers while heavy steers and bullocks were only three scores. Apart from a few singles, there were no vealers yarded.

Most of the better bred feeder steers were dearer but the rise in quality accounted for most of that rise in price. The balance of the young cattle sold at steady rates while demand from local restockers continued to be strong. There was a strong slaughter demand for light heifers which remained unsatisfied at the end of the day due to a lack of numbers. 

The older and heavy steers and bullocks were unfinished yet they sold at firm rates. Heavy export heifers and the plain yarding of bulls sold at firm rates. Cows met stronger competition and sold at dearer values.

The top sale price of the day was 242.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight steer weaners."
"There was little change in the number of cattle yarded with the traditional autumn sell off continuing.  Vealers and yearling cattle made up a large percentage of the yarding, while cows dominated the grown cattle section.

Quality of the young cattle was mixed with a fair number of vealers and yearlings losing their bloom however, there were some good runs of well bred cattle offered.  The market could not maintain itsâ€™ recent rates with most classes of cattle loosing ground.  Vealer steers were 4c cheaper and more in places for the plain type steers, while vealer heifers were 7c/kg easier.  Feeder steers sold firm to 5c cheaper and feeder heifers were up to 10c/kg cheaper.

The yarding of export cattle consisted of a large penning of cows and a few lots of grown steers and heifers through the sale.  Quality of the cows was very mixed with some pens of well finished 3 and 4 scores, however there was increased numbers of low yielding plain 1and 2 score cows offered.  Grown steers saw little change, while heifers were down by 5c/kg.  The cow market varied with heavyweights 4c cheaper and medium cows held generally firm, while lightweight cows were 10c/kg cheaper."
"There was little change in quality other than in the trade yearling heifers,  and a few pens of high yield cows which were presented in top condition. The usual Buyers attended, providing a solid and even market. Numbers yarded were lower than usual, due to the heavy rain over the last two weeks.

Trade heifers sold at dearer prices again, due to shortage of numbers, but all other young cattle showed no change in value.

Male export cattle met an even market, with no alteration in price obvious. Cows were good quality, and there were small price rises in the highest yielding cows with light and medium cows unchanged."
"There was increased numbers at Armidale, partly due to a sell-off late weaners and a draft of yearling steers selling due to the continuing dry conditions. There was a rise in numbers coming off crop, with few cattle being grain assisted. Cow numbers doubled week-on-week. The regular gallery of buyers attended.

Weaner steers sold to cheaper trends, however quality varied from last sale and saw prices of 220c to 283c/kg. Heifer vealers sold to firm trends on last week, with the trade acquiring some of the better finished drafts. An offering of well-bred medium weight steers sold to cheaper trends of 20c/kg, due to those cattle forced onto the market by the continuing dry weather. Well-bred heavy feeders sold to a top of 300c with that category selling to dearer trends of 30c/kg. Medium weight heifers to feed sold to cheaper trends of 17c/kg, heavy weights slightly dearer.

Light cows saw improved trends of 5c/kg, with a reduction in the one score offering seen over the past few sales. Medium weight two score cows sold to cheaper trends, down 18c and the 3 score portion were 13c/kg dearer. Heavy three and four score cows saw rises of 5c/kg. Bulls were slightly dearer."
"There was another small yarding which was comprised mainly of vealers and yearlings, along with a few pens of grown cattle. The quality of the young cattle was very mixed and consisted of some well-finished, supplementary fed yearlings and some cattle off crop, as well as a fair number of plain cattle. 

Competition was stronger for most classes of cattle, with restocker vealer steers topping at 207.2c and vealer heifers to slaughter selling to 170c, whole those to restockers reached 190c/kg. Supplementary fed yearlings met keen demand, with yearling steers topping at 195c and the heifers making to 180c/kg. Feeder steers sold to 194c and heifers to 189c/kg. 

The export yarding saw strong competition from processors, with bullocks selling to 189c, heifers to 166c and medium weight cows up to 139c/kg."
"There was another small yarding consisting mainly of light weight yearlings and a few pens of cows. The quality of the yarding was very mixed, with cattle showing the effects of the dry weather.  Most of the yearlings went to restockers at similar prices to last week.  

The odd pen of trade yearling steers and heifers generally sold firm, while restocker cattle sold according to breed type and condition. The few pens of cows were slightly easier as there was limited buyer competition."
"There was another small yarding and quality was mixed.  There were a few trade heifers which showed some finish, while most of the young steers sold to the restockers. There were just 8 cows yarded and there were a few pens of grown steers and bullocks.  

Only a small field of buyers competed and the market displayed a dearer trend. Yearling heifers lifted in value and those to the trade sold in a range of 153c to 180c/kg. Restockers purchased the young steers and they also sold dearer reaching 194c/kg for lightweights.

The limited supply of cows showed little price change. Grown steers and bullocks sold in a range of 155c and 169c/kg to processing orders.  There were 18 heavy bulls yarded and they reached 140c/kg."
"There was another small offering with numbers in decline. This is a trend that should continue until late in the year. The quality of the offering was fair with the condition of the offering well down. There were very few good quality well finished cattle available. Yearling heifers made up almost 50% of the penning while vealer supplies are almost finished. All regular processing orders were in place and there was an extra feedlot operator in attendance. Quality accounted for most price variations in what was otherwise a solid market.

Yearling steers saw the best quality lightweights sell slightly dearer while the plain quality cattle held firm. Trade 3 score heifer yearlings sold to cheaper trend with breed quality accounting for much of the variation. Lightweight C2 heifer yearlings to processors sold at dearer rates. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed also sold slightly dearer.

There were too few heavy steers to quote a market trend. A mixed quality offering of grown heifers sold firm. The small penning of cows sold firm to slightly cheaper."
"There was another reduction in numbers. The quality of the offering was good although the condition reflected the cold winter weather. There were very few well finished cattle available and a small number of heavy steer vealers and yearling heifers. By far the biggest percentage of the young cattle were in condition ideal for restockers and feedlotters. All last weeks buyers were in attendance and operating and restocker orders were prevalent.

Demand for vealer steers to restock was strong with the market showing a firm to dearer trend, up 4c/kg on the good quality lots. Heifer vealers were 5c to 6c/kg cheaper with good numbers available, with the overall quality showing a slight improvement. Yearling steers to restockers and lotfeeders saw light and medium weights sell firm to 4c/kg dearer while heavy lines sold to a cheaper trend with less demand. Yearling heifers, most going to restockers and feeders, sold firm, with the few well finished 3 scores to the trade dearer.

Heavy steers sold to a dearer trend with quality also showing improvement. Grown heifers sold slightly cheaper with the quality also down. The cow market saw a cheaper trend, down 2c to 3c/kg and more in place with quality and a drop in yields contributing. Bulls sold at cheaper rates with quality also plainer."
"There was another reduction in numbers with quality and condition very mixed. There were a few good heavy cows, while the majority of the young cattle lacked finish. There was a restricted field of buyers in attendance.

Quality was a factor in the market with light and medium weight steer vealers selling to restockers 11c/kg cheaper. The heifer portion was also cheaper, while the better quality heifer vealers to processors were dearer. An improved quality yarding of yearling steers sold to restockers with significant price improvement. Plain condition heifer yearlings to the trade sold to a slightly cheaper trend, while those to restockers were dearer.

There were no heavy grown steers to quote. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, while the heavy cows were 9c to 16c dearer averaging around 140c/kg, with much of the improvement quality related."
"There was another normal sized yarding for this time of the year, after some very heavy early frosts.  The breed quality was improved, heavy steers and bullocks were well represented, but cows were plain and in much smaller numbers. The usual operators attended.

The trend in the market was from firm to dearer, with demand strong for finished cattle and restock steers and steer weaners. The steers, yearlings and weaners, heifer vealers and  the trade heifers, were to 3c/kg dearer. All other young stock sold at firm prices.

The bullocks were much improved in quality and were fully firm.  Medium cows sold to a dearer trend, but high yielding cows were much shorter supplied than in recent months."
"There was another increase in numbers, reflecting the current seasonal conditions. Light and medium weight young cattle were well supplied, particularly yearling heifers. The quality of those young cattle was very mixed. There were some good cows penned, however there were few other grown cattle. Around 100 cow/calf units were offered. There was increased export processor competition, however trade and restocker activity was somewhat subdued.

Erratic, best described the market for yearling steers to restock and feed with the better quality light and medium weights selling to a dearer trend, overall average quality improved. The secondary quality cattle in all classes sold to a cheaper trend, generally with an odd exception in the lightweights. Heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend with some good lines presented. The better quality lightweights to restockers were down 5c to 6c/kg, while those to process experienced greater falls.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote a trend. Heavy grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, with export processors looking for weight. Under the increased export competition the cow market improved. The trend on the better heavy weights was up 5c/kg. The plainer condition cows also experienced a dearer trend.

The cows and calves topped at $770/unit to be cheaper than the previous sale."
"There was another good yarding of cattle with numbers up slightly.  Vealers made up a large percentage of the yarding, yearlings were in fair numbers, while cows dominated the grown cattle.  Quality of the young cattle was good with several runs of well bred vealer steers and heifers offered.  Most of the vealer steers went to restockers and there were several pens of heifers which also returned to the paddock.

Competition was strong however, not quite up to the high rates of the last sale.  Restocker vealer steers were slightly easier, while vealer heifers to slaughter lost 8c/kg and restocker heifers were less affected.  Yearling feeder and restocker steers medium and lightweights sold firm to slightly easier, while heavy feeder steers sold 2c/kg dearer for the well bred cattle.  Yearling heifers to feed and restock were firm to a little easier.  Trade heifers followed a similar trend.

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of cows, along with a fair penning of grown steers and grown heifers.  Quality was good with steers and heifers selling to an easier trend, and cows at times struggled to hold firm."
"There was another big yarding, after some frost, but the majority were weaners, plain yearlings and cows. Grown steers and bullocks, and finished yearlings were in very few numbers, and their quality was low. The usual Operators attended the sale, the consistency of the market in recent weeks, is a major feature of the sales.

There was a dearer trend of 2 to 3 cents per kilogram for weaners, and a similar rise for restock yearling steers, which met a stronger enquiry from a wider field of Buyers. The balance of the young cattle were fully firm.

There were only just enough steers or bullocks with finish, to quote a firm market. These types are now hard to source.

Cows sold at fully firm rates under very consistent demand for the medium and heavy types, but plain light cows showed a weakening in value. Export feeder steers were in fair numbers and sold at improved prices."
"There was an obvious falling away in quality of most descriptions as the stock feed situation worsens and the weather gets colder. Yearling steer numbers increased and weaners and heifer vealer numbers were maintained at a similar level to the previous sale. There were fewer cows yarded and the heavier yielding types were yarded in much lower numbers while plain and light manufacturing cow numbers increased. 

The number of local restockers bidding on weaner or yearling cattle was noticeably reduced as local producers get ready to feed breeding cattle but not weaners. The demand for restocker cattle was therefore reduced and values for the heavier steer weaners were 3c to 4c/kg cheaper. Lighter weights were to 10c/kg cheaper. Heifer vealers and weaners were also cheaper but the yearling restocker steers and feeder yearlings held their value well.

The few lots of bullocks yarded were quite well finished and they sold at fully firm rates. Export heifers were in fair supply and sold at marginally cheaper prices. The cow price varied a little but was generally cheaper in a range of 3c to 4c/kg. Export weight feeder steers met strong demand for an unchanged market."
"There was an increased supply, with yearlings making up the bulk of the offering. Vealers were in small numbers and grown cattle were also limited to a small number of full mouth bullocks and cows. The regular processor orders were in place and restocker competition was strong.

The small number of vealers were purchased by restockers at much dearer rates. Light and medium weight yearling steers included weaned cattle and showed a significant improvement in quality. This was reflected in the average price change for those to restock, up between 41c and 42c/kg. Heifer yearlings to the trade and restockers sold to a cheaper trend, down 1c to 8c/kg.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote with less than a full mouth. Heavy manufacturing steers sold firm to 2c/kg dearer. There was little but a quality related change in the cow market."
"There was an increased penning, comprising a very mixed quality offering of young cattle and cows. Grown heifers were in fair numbers, while bulls made up 10% of the total. There were limited supplies of well finished young cattle, a few having had access to oats. There was reduced processor competition, however restockers were active.

Comparing the market to the previous sale held 2 weeks ago trends were dearer across all classes of young cattle. Restockers and to a lessor extent feedlots competed strongly. Vealers to restock improved by 20c to 30c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw a dearer trend of 20c/kg and more in places taking breed and quality into account. There was significant improvement in the market for plain quality lightweight yearling heifers under solid restocker competition. The better quality heifers sold firm to 14c/kg dearer.

Despite the reduced processor competition well finished grown heifers sold firm to only slightly cheaper. The cow market was much stronger across all but the plainest quality lots. Well finished cows were as much as 17c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls were firm to slightly dearer despite reduced processor competition."
"There was an increased penning with light weight young cattle well supplied. Overall the quality of the offering was mixed, a couple of larger lines, however small lots dominated the penning. Condition varied with a large percentage suitable to restock and feed. There was limited processor competition, while restocker and feedlot activity was high.

Restocker demand was high through the young cattle resulting in dearer trends of 40c to 50c/kg on the light weight yearling steers up to 330kg. Breed and quality along with a single large line of steers contributed to the improvement. Medium and heavy weight steers to feed sold on a firm to dearer market trend, again quality a factor in price change. Restocker steers in the medium weight class posted a much dearer market trend. The lightest weight class of yearling heifers sold to dearer trends when purchased by restockers. The medium and heavy weight feeder heifers saw a substantially dearer market trend.

There were limited numbers of heavy grown steers to process, to few to quote. Well finished grown heifers to process sold to cheaper trends with restricted competition. The breed and quality of the heifers to feed contributed to price change. There were cheaper trends of 13c to 26c/kg in the cow market with limited competition. Trends were firm to cheaper in the bull market where restricted processor competition played a part.

Market reporter, James Armitage"
"There was an increased penning to wind up sales for the year. Yearlings were well supplied as were cows. The quality of the offering was very mixed, as was condition. There were a few well finished older cattle, though not many through the young cattle. The regular buyers attended, along with extra restocker and feedlot competition.

Market trends varied through the young cattle. Light weight calves attracted strong restocker competition to sell to a significantly dearer trend for both the heifer and male portions. Light weight yearling steers sold on a firm to dearer market trend, with restockers active on the lighter weights, while feed lotters were operating on the heavier weights. There were some quality related price changes. Medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a slightly dearer trend. Plain quality yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends with quality a factor in price change. The better quality heifer yearlings suitable to feed sold to a dearer trend, up to 7c/kg.

There were a few heavy grown steers penned, they sold firm to cheaper. The cow market experienced cheaper trends of 13c to 25c/kg, with the plainer condition most affected. There was increased restocker competition on those plain condition cows as a result. Heavy bulls sold to cheaper trends of as much as 20c/kg."
"There was an increased penning in front of the usual buyers and quite a few casual onlookers. All categories were represented however cows and young cattle made up the bulk. Quality and condition was very mixed throughout.

Varying trends through the young cattle with the plainer quality lightweight vealers sellin g to substantially dearer trends, breed was a factor. The better quality C muscles were cheaper, again breed contributing. An improved quality penning of heavier weights  experienced strong gains. Trends were similar for the heifer portion. Light weight C muscle yearling steers to restockers sold to cheaper trends. The medium weights attracted strong restocker competition to show dearer trends with breed specific premiums. Yearling heifers to restock and feed experienced strong gains in average prices with quality a factor in that improvement.

Insufficient grown steers to quote. Well finished grown heifers sold to dearer trends for the most part. There was reduced restocker competition in the cow market. This combined with reduced demand from processors resulted in cheaper trends throughout all classes."
"There was an increased penning as the prospect of a very dry spring hits home. The quality and condition of the offering tended to plain. There were some well finished grown cattle, with minimal supplies in the young cattle. Bulls were well supplied. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Market trends through the young cattle were generally dearer than the sale 2 weeks ago. Steer vealers to restockers were up to 10c/kg dearer. Light weight yearling steers attracted strong restocker competition to post strong gains. The medium and heavy weight feeder steers experienced little but quality related price change. Plain quality light weight yearling heifers to restockers sold to a slightly dearer trend, while the better quality light weights also showed small but quality related price change. Heavy trade heifers were slightly dearer. 

A run of light weight grown steers carrying 2 teeth attracted strong competition from restocker and feeder orders. They topped the market from a c/kg basis, with breed a factor. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. There was not a lot of difference in the cow market. The plainest of the cows however failed to attract much competition. There was very strong competition between a live export order and processors in the bull market. This resulted in a much dearer market trend than the previous sale, where that order was not present."
"There was an increased penning as the poor seasonal conditions continue. There was a large supply of light weight young cattle. There were a few well finished grown cattle including cows. The balance of the cattle saw quality very mixed with condition on the plainer end of the spectrum.there were a few new faces in the buying group replacing some absentees in the regular group.

The young cattle saw demand generally weaker with the mixed nature of the offering playing a role. Trends were mostly cheaper with some large falls. These falls were exacerbated by the longer gap between sales. The exception to the cheaper trends were the lightly muscled light weight yearling heifers that attracted strong restocker competition. They saw a breed related improvement and a dearer market trend.

The market was no better on the grown cattle with a limited supply of well finished grown steers and heifers selling to a much cheaper trend. The cow market followed suit recording some of the largest price falls of the day."
"There was an increased offering that included good lines of light weight yearlings presented in store condition. Very few grown cattle were penned apart from a cows and an increased penning of bulls. The overall quality of the cattle was very mixed, while there were limited numbers presented in well finished condition. An export processor returned after a prolonged absence, while another did not operate.

The market for young cattle showed varying trends, with yearling steers to restock selling to a cheaper trend. Breed quality was a contributing factor in average price changes, with the actual trend not as great as some of the falls. There was a much larger penning of yearling heifers. Restockers were active on the well-bred lines with the market trend dearer. The quality of the heifers was also a factor in the strong price gains. The limited number of well finished heifers also sold to a dearer trend.

The cow market saw the better heavy weights sell to a dearer trend with the extra competition. Plainer condition medium weights sold to a cheaper trend. The large offering of heavy bulls also sold to a dearer trend with the increase in competition."
"There was an increased offering of plainer quality and conditioned cattle, as producers cash in on the current high prices being paid by restockers. Very lightweight yearlings were in good numbers with most under 200kg lwt, there was also a fair number of plain condition cows. The regular processors were in attendance although not well catered for while restocker demand was very high.

The demand from restockers looking for lightweight cattle was very strong and the market responded accordingly. Bearing in mind that most were light, the trend was 30c to 40c/kg dearer for both the lightweight steers and heifers. Yearling steers to feed in the medium and heavyweight classes also sold to a dearer trend, up 3c/kg. The light heifer yearlings bought to process sold at cheaper rates, however this was mainly due to a drop in quality. C3 trade heifer yearlings sold to a slightly dearer trend, up 5c/kg.

There were no good quality heavy steers to speak of. Cows to restockers sold at firm rates, but slightly dearer when taking quality into account. There was little price difference for the few cows to slaughter."
"There was an increase penning with all categories represented. The overall quality of the offering was quite mixed. The condition of the cattle was fair to very good. The usual processors were in attendance with one showing an increased participation. There was reduced feedlot competition, while restocker demand was again high.

Market trends were generally cheaper through the young cattle with both breed and quality having a major impact on price change. Light weight vealers steers remained firm for the few available. The yearling steers saw a large correction with breed a strong reason. The medium and heavy weight feeder steers saw breed and the reduced competition impact prices. There was an isolated dearer sale in steers to restockers. A very mixed quality penning of yearling heifers followed similar trends.

There were a few well finished heavy weight grown steers penned. Increased processor competition saw them sell to a dearer trend. The well finished grown heifers followed a similar trend with improvements in the older lines. There was little change in the cow market. Demand high and processor competition strong in the heavy weight bull market. This resulted in a dearer trend.

Market reporter, James Armitage"
"There was an increase of 200 head for a total of 795. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering . The quality of the yarding was very mixed, good for the most part however there were some very plain quality cattle penned. The condition varied from plain to very good with a marked improvement in the yearling heifers. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Market trends varied for vealer steers to restockers with the medium weights remaining firm. The heavier weights were considerably dearer as buyers look for more weight heading into the colder weather. Heifers were cheaper. Medium and heavy yearling steers sold to dearer trends showing strong gains. Trends firm to dearer for the yearling heifers, most showing good condition.

Heavy grown steers remained firm. PTE grown heifers were keenly sought by feedlotters and sold to dearer trends. Those to process firm. Quality a factor  for price change in the cow market, the trend however was firm to slightly dearer.."
"There was an increase in the overall numbers with young cattle well supplied. It was a very mixed quality penning, below the previous sale. There were some very good quality lots through each category with condition also very mixed. The usual buyers were in attendance and there was an extra cow buyer.

Restockers were again active on light and medium weight young cattle with weaner steers selling to a dearer trend. For the most part however market trends were cheaper with quality an issue. There was a great deal of variation in the quality of the light weight yearling steers with this reflected in the large range of prices. The medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed were as much as 15c/kg cheaper. Odd pens of better quality yearling heifers to restockers were a little dearer however for the most part trends were cheaper with quality also playing a role.

There was little change in the market for heavy grown steers. The cow market responded to the extra processor competition to show a dearer trend of 1c to 2c/kg on heavy weights. A very strong market for heavy bulls saw them as much as 13c/kg dearer."
"There was an increase in the numbers, with the last sale held 3 weeks ago. With the cold weather just around the corner, producers loathe to hold onto stock much longer. Cows and young cattle made up the bulk of the offering. The quality of the yarding was very mixed, with a few pens of well bred feeder cattle available. The condition was mostly on the lower end of the scale with a few exceptions. Most of the usual processors attended, while there was increased feeder and restocker competition.

Bear in mind that this report compares to the previous sale 3 weeks ago. The increased restocker competition resulted in the steer vealers to restockers selling to a dearer trend, however the improvement was not a lot. The heifer portion to restockers were much dearer. There were some very well finished heavy weight vealers penned, suitable to the trade. They attracted premiums of 25c to 30c/kg over the plainer condition lots. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed attracted strong competition, this, combined with a quality improvement, saw the market firm to 16c/kg dearer, with the heavy weights seeing the best improvement. Yearling heifers to feed sold to a dearer trend of as much as 30c/kg. Again, there was some improvement in quality.

There were some good quality feeders in the grown steer category, also attracting strong demand. Light and medium weight cows sold to a slightly dearer trend, with both processors and restockers active. The well finished heavy weight cows saw weaker demand and less competition to sell to a cheaper trend. There was a large penning of bulls. Strong demand from live exporters and processors resulted in a firm to dearer market trend, with the secondary quality bulls seeing the strongest gains."
"There was an increase in supply, however numbers remain low. Lightweight young cattle made up the bulk offered with a line of plain condition Angus weaners a standout. Overall condition was plain except for an odd yearling heifer and a few cows. Processor competition was limited to a couple of commission buyers with orders, while local restocker competition was once again in operation.

Breed quality contributed to higher average prices for steer vealers to restock with the market trend firm to slightly dearer for lightweights. Medium weights experienced a significantly dearer trend. The lightweight heifer vealers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 13c to 21c/kg. Quality of the lightweight yearling steers to restock was well below the previous week with this the reason behind the dramatic fall in prices. Lightweight yearling heifers to process sold to a slightly dearer trend, up 4c, while those to restock were cheaper, down 5c/kg. There was a single pen of well finished medium weight trade heifers that sold dearer.

There were too few grown steers and heifers to quote. The cow market was cheaper, down 3c to 4c/kg under restricted competition."
"There was an increase in supply, however numbers remain low in the face of what should be an excellent spring. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering with a small penning of grown cattle. Most of the regular processors were in attendance and there was good restocker support.

There was a small number of late vealers penned that sold strongly. Restockers showed their confidence in the season with a dearer market resulting through all grade of yearlings. Lightweight yearling steers sold dearer, averaging 7c/kg better, however odd sales showed significant improvement. Extra competition on medium weights saw these steers sell well up to other sales in the region, despite there being nothing to compare from the previous sale at this centre. Heifer yearlings also sold strongly with restockers active on light weights, the market dearer by 17c/kg. Medium and heavy heifer yearlings were 8c to 9c/kg dearer.

The small offering of heavy steers sold to a dearer trend, up 1c to 2c/kg. The cow market was very strong with plainer condition cows improving significantly. The better finished medium and heavy cows improved by 5c to 11c/kg."
"There was an increase in supply with the offering made up mostly of young cattle and a fair supply of cows. The quality of the yarding was mixed throughout all categories. There were some well finished yearling and grown heifers suitable to the trade along with a few very good cows. There was increased processor competition and good support from restockers.

With the prospect of a reasonably good start to spring just around the corner, restocker confidence was high with increased demand. This resulted in the vealer steers selling strongly, mostly dearer. The few vealer heifers suitable to the trade remained firm, while medium weights to restock selling to a dearer trend with sought after breeds showing strong gains. Once again the lightweight yearling steer classes included pre weaned cattle regardless of weight. The trend for this class was dearer with the very lightweights up 2c/kg. Breed quality and extra competition were a contributing factor in medium weight steers showing considerable price gains on a dearer market trend. Lightweight yearling heifers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, while medium weights were a little dearer. Well finished heifers to the trade sold to a dearer trend, extra competition and an improvement in yield potential a contributing factor.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. A small but very good quality penning of grown heifers attracted strong demand and sold to a dearer trend. Increased competition for all types of cows saw the market trend dearer."
"There was an increase in supply with quality very mixed. The offering comprised mostly of well-bred cattle in forward condition, however there were quite a few secondary quality plain condition yearlings and grown cattle penned. Fair supplies of vealers and grown cattle were penned, with yearlings making up the bulk of the penning. All regular buyers were in place and there were some extra lot feeders and restockers operating.

The extra buyers in the market created strong and spirited competition, with dearer trends for all classes of young cattle. A lift in quality saw vealers to restock 10c to 35c/kg dearer for steers and more for the heifer portion. Light yearling steers to restock saw prices vary according to quality. Medium and heavy yearling steers to feed saw a benefit from the extra competition, with averages improving by 7c to 8c/kg and some sales showed greater improvement. Medium weight heifer yearlings to feed were 7c to 13c/kg dearer, while heavy weights averaged cheaper with an increase in weight the major factor. Secondary quality young cattle to restock sold very well in comparison to the good quality lines from a cents per kilogram perspective.

There were no heavy grown steers to speak of. Cows sold to a dearer trend of up to 8c/kg. Increased numbers brought about some quality variation which in turn restricted some average prices."
"There was an increase in supply with light weight young cattle making up the bulk of the offering. Despite a lack of condition in majority of the young cattle the overall quality was good. There were minimal numbers of medium and heavy weight yearlings. Amongst the grown cattle were some very good heifers and some high yielding cows. The usual processors were in attendance along with a strong gallery of restockers.

Demand was very high and competition strong from restockers on the back of recent rainfall. Dearer trends were present through all classes of young cattle. The light weight yearlings, both steers and heifers, saw prices improve by a significant amount. Weight and quality variations accounted for the large price gap in some classes. The limited supply of medium and heavy weight yearlings also sold to dearer trends, however the improvement was nowhere near as great as that of the light weights.

There were no heavy grown steers penned. Well finished grown heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend with an improvement in quality also. The cow market was strong with restockers active on a few plainer condition lots. Well finished cows to process sold to a dearer trend of up to 7c/kg. There was also an improvement in quality. Heavy bulls remained firm."
"There was an increase in supply with heavy weight yearling steers and cows showing the best representation. The quality of the offering was very mixed with few lines in double figures. There was increased restocker and feedlot competition while the regular processors were in attendance.

Market trends were generally cheaper through the young cattle however there were a few positive trends. Weaner steers to restockers sold to cheaper trends with quality a factor as most of the good weaners have been sold through the Weaner sales. The lighter end of the heifer weaners also sold to cheaper trends with those carrying more weight selling to a dearer trend. Nothing to compare to in medium weight yearling steers from the previous sale however they were comparable to other local sales. The heavy weight feeder steers saw little but quality related price change. Light and medium weight yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends while the heavy weights showed an improved market trend.

Heavy weight export cattle saw demand from processors much weaker. This resulted in the well finished heavy grown steers and heifers selling to much cheaper trends. The cow market fell substantially in the fortnight showing falls of 30c to 40c/kg. The bull market followed suit."
"There was an increase in supply with 845 head on offer. Concerns about the weather bringing more forward. The quality of the offering was very mixed, young cattle made up the bulk of the offering with no heavy steers and a fair supply of cows. The majority of the young cattle were showing the effects of a tough Winter. All the regular processors were in attendance as were the feedlotters and there was good restocker activity.

Light and medium weight yearling steers sold on a firm to cheaper trend with the secondary quality cattle attracting less competition. The heavy weight feeder steers sold to a dearer trend of as much as 6c/kg with an overall improvement in quality. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers sold to cheaper trends. The medium and heavy weights suitable to feed sold to dearer trends.

Grown heifers to feed sold to cheaper trends for a very mixed quality offering. The medium weight cows varied with the better condition lots selling to a cheaper trend while the plainer condition cows were firm to cheaper. Well finished heavy cows sold to a cheaper trend of 10c to 12c/kg in the fortnight. The heavy bull market was only slightly cheaper."
"There was an increase in supply as numbers slowly increase. The quality of the offering was very mixed. There was a good supply of well finished medium and heavy weight yearlings and quite a few heavy weight grown cattle. There was a fair supply of plainer quality cattle also. There was reduced processor competition, while the regular feedlot orders were in place. Restocker activity varied.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with vealers returning to the paddock selling to dearer trends. The medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed sold on a firm to slightly cheaper market trend with some quality related price change. Quality and breed contributed to some strong price gains for yearling heifers to feed. Market trends firm to dearer with the best of the improvement in the medium weights. Heifers purchased by the trade sold to cheaper trends. Grown steers to feed in the 400 to 500kg weight range remained firm with breed and age related price change. The heavier weights saw a significantly cheaper trend with discounts for the older crossbred lines. The restricted processor competition resulted in cheaper trends for suitable lines. Grown heifers also sold to cheaper trends with limited processor activity. 

The cow market saw a cheaper trend of as much as 20c/kg. Heavy bulls were the hardest hit by the limited processor competition to sell to a significantly cheaper trend."
"There was an increase in supplies with weaners and cows again making up the bulk of the offering. Quality was very mixed and there were large numbers of plain condition cattle penned, the result of poor seasonal conditions. A single pen of well finished heavy grown steers were a standout. The usual processors attended and the usual restocker and feedlot orders were in place.

Demand varied through the young cattle with weaner steers to restockers selling to a cheaper trend of 20c to 30c/kg. Conversely, the heifer weaners in the same weight ranges sold to a dearer trend of up to 5c/kg. Vealer heifers suitable to the trade sold to a cheaper trend of up to 9c/kg on the 2 scores, with quality an issue. Heavy yearling feeder steers averaged dearer for quality on an otherwise mostly firm market trend. Medium and heavy weight yearling feeder heifers sold to dearer trend of 10c to 11c/kg, competition and quality improved.

No market comparison on the well finished heavy grown steers. Plain condition grown heifers sold to cheaper trends, while the well finished lots sold firm to slightly dearer. Plain condition cows sold to cheaper trends with the exception of some joined and PTIC lots that attracted restocker competition. The well finished heavy weight cows remained mostly firm with an isolated dearer sale."
"There was an increase in stock numbers but certainly no increase in the average quality. A very high percentage surprisingly lacked the finish expected at present. Cows were yarded in fair numbers but older steers were in short supply. The usual regular buyers attended, including one extra light cattle company who did not operate last sale.

There was a very strong market for heifers under 220 kilograms, mostly 2 and 3 score, and these sold from 8c to 10c/kg dearer. The tops of the restocker yearling steers were firm but the average for all other yearlings was 3c and 4c cheaper. 

The export cattle overall sold to a significantly cheaper trend with heavy steers up to 5c cheaper. There were no bullocks yarded.

Cows of all weights and fat scores also sold to a cheaper market, most dropping between 3c to 5c/kg.The improved performace of the Australian dollar against the U.S.dollar probably affecting the price paid. 

The few bulls yarded were plain with no B muscle types available.

Restocker demand is still very strong with the major enquiry from local growers for  lightweight steers and heifers. These grades however, are difficult to buy."
"There was an increase in overall numbers. Vealers and yearlings increased in supply while there were a few more heavy grown steers but fewer cows available. The quality of the offering was mixed with some very good quality and conditions pens scattered throughout. The usual buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market saw varying trends. An improved quality penning of vealer steers saw most go to restockers on a dearer trend, up to 11c/kg. Heifer vealers sold firm to dearer with the increased price aligned to improved quality. The quality of the yearling steers to restock and feed was mixed. The trend for light and medium weights was firm to dearer. An increased offering of heavy yearling steers had little effect on the market which remained firm with quality the only variable. Heifer yearlings to all destinations sold to a cheaper trend.

Heavy grown steers saw little change in the market. In the cow sales all but the best heavy C muscle lines sold to a cheaper trend."
"There was an increase in overall numbers, with vealers and cows making up the bulk of the offering. Quality was very mixed throughout, with vealers showing an improvement. Well finished young cattle were limited in number, with most better suited to restocker and feedlot specifications. There was increased restocker demand in all categories, limited feedlot and processor competition.

Dearer trends were evident in the vealer market, with all the steers and most of the heifers selling to restocker interests. The steer vealers were 8c to 9c/kg dearer, with some quality related price improvement. Heifer vealers returning to the paddock attracted strong competition to record dearer trends of 2c to 30c/kg. Heifer vealers to the processors improved by up to 5c/kg. Strong gains were seen through the yearling market with both steers and heifers showing a benefit from the increased competition.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. Grown heifers remained close to firm. There was increased restocker demand for cows regardless of condition, while there were only a couple of processors operating. The plainer condition cows to restock sold to a dearer trend, up 2c to 15c/kg, while there was little change in the better condition cows to process."
"There was an increase in numbers, with vealers, yearlings and cows in good supply. The quality of the young cattle was very mixed as was the condition. Restockers were well catered for, while there was a small number of very well finished yearlings suitable to the trade. There were limited supplies of grown steers or heifers. There was restricted processor competition on cows, while the usual young cattle processors operated. Restockers were active on young cattle and cows.

Market trends varied through the young cattle, with both breed and quality affecting price change. This accounted for some of the large price variation. Light weight vealer steers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend. The medium weights to restockers were firm to dearer. Heavy weights to restockers sold to a cheaper trend, with quality a factor. Heifer vealers to restockers saw little but quality related price change. Medium weight yearling feeder steers attracted strong competition and sold to a dearer trend of as much as 30c/kg, with breed and quality a factor. The good quality, well bred lines attracted strong premiums. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed sold on a firm to slightly cheaper market trend, with some quality related price change. An improved quality penning of heifer yearlings suitable to the trade sold to a dearer trend of as much as 13c/kg, the quality contributing.

There was increased restocker competition for plain condition cows, resulting in dearer trends through the light and medium weights, with some strong gains recorded. The restricted processor competition had little effect on the market for well finished cows, with the market trend generally unchanged. No live export competition this week saw bulls sell to a much cheaper trend."
"There was an increase in numbers, with the quality of the offering very mixed. There were a large percentage of secondary quality young cattle offered while well-bred, well finished cattle were in limited supply. There was restricted feedlot and processor activity due to the limited number of suitable cattle. Restockers were active across all categories and classes.

There was quite a bit of price variation due to the quality of the young cattle, particularly in light weight yearling steers. Well-bred light weight steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend. There was keen local restocker interest in heifer yearlings, with market trends significantly dearer. Heifers in the 280-400kg weight range saw price improvements of 25c to 40c/kg.

Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, with cows selling firm to dearer. Heavy bulls sold to a slightly cheaper trend."
"There was an increase in numbers, with the overall quality fair to very good. The increased supplies of yearlings and cows were showing high levels of finish. Light weight young cattle were also plentiful. The usual buyers were in attendance, with all competing strongly.

Increased demand and suitable cattle combined to see all classes of young cattle show significant price improvement. The low numbers and quality change from the previous week make specific price changes difficult to compare. Depending on breed some of the very light yearlings and vealers sold to a level similar to the recent peak of the market. A very good quality penning of heavy yearling steers and heifers to feeders were also much dearer than the previous 2 weeks.

Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend with C muscles improving by 14c to 20c/kg. The cow market saw the better finished medium and heavy weights up to 17c/kg dearer while there was little change in the plainer condition cows."
"There was an increase in numbers, with the offering mostly comprised of young cattle and cows. There were a small percentage of grown steers, heifers and bulls. Overall the quality was mixed throughout all categories. Good quality vealers were in fair supply, however there was a limited offering of quality yearlings. There was reduced processor and feedlot competition, while restockers were still active.

Market trends through the young cattle varied with most tending to be cheaper. An improved quality penning of medium and heavy vealer steers suitable to restockers were dearer. There was also an EU accredited component to the price increase. Light and medium weights sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Heifer vealers to restock also sold to a slightly cheaper trend with quality variations also evident. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend as a result of the reduced competition. Lightweights attracted less restocker competition as more weaners come onto the market. Medium and heavy feeder steers were up to 25c/kg cheaper. Heifer yearlings also suffered from reduced competition with the market trend similar to that of the steers. Well finished heifers suitable to the trade remained firm.

There were too few heavy steers to quote. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend with very few good quality well finished lots available. Restockers were active in the cow market. The trend was generally cheaper however odd classes saw little change. The best cows were down as much as 11c/kg."
"There was an increase in numbers, with over 1000 head penned for only the second time this year. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the yarding, with only a limited supply of heavy steers and grown heifers. All the regular processor orders were in place and there was extra feedlot competition on lightweight heifers. The market was solid throughout, with the biggest variable being quality.

Lightweight vealer steers to restock sold to a dearer trend, while the medium and heavyweights sold firm to a shade cheaper. There was some quality related variation through the medium weights. Heifer vealers to processors sold to a cheaper trend, down 8c to 11c/kg. The quality of the yearling steers showed quite a bit of variation. The market for lightweights was down by 3c/kg, with the medium and heavy weights slightly dearer, up 4c to 6c/kg. The extra competition on lightweight yearling heifers forced the trend dearer, up 8c to 17c/kg. The medium weights to feed remained firm while the heavy weights were slightly dearer.

Quality was a factor in the price change for heavy steers, with the market trend firm. The grown heifers followed a similar trend. The cow market was strong once again, with competition for plainer condition cows to go back to the paddock heating up. Overall the trend throughout was firm to dearer."
"There was an increase in numbers, with large numbers of yearlings, particularly heifers penned. Vealers normally held for longer were also in fair supply. There were forced selloffs in the yearlings, with both property sale and a lack of feed cited as reasons. There were limited supplies of well finished cattle and they were mainly cows. Overall, the quality of the offering showed a great variation, while the condition of the young cattle was on the lean side. The usual buyers attended and there was increased restocker and feedlot competition.

Market trends varied through the young cattle. A number of factors affected price change, namely quality, breed and the ability to procure straight lines of well bred cattle. Light weight steer vealers to restockers sold to cheaper trends where breed was a factor. The heavier weight steers to restockers saw a significant price improvement, with quality and breed influencing that change. Increased competition saw the heifer vealers to the paddock sell firm to dearer, those to the trade sold to a cheaper trend. Quality and breed were factors in price change for yearling steers to restock and feed in a market trend that otherwise saw little change. There were premiums for straight lines over mixed breed pens. Very strong restocker demand and increased feeder competition saw yearling heifers in all weight classes sell to dearer trends of 6c to 30c/kg. The restocker heifers and light weight feeders experienced the best of the price change.

The few well finished heavy grown steers to processors sold on a firm to cheaper market trend. There was further improvement in the cow market, up 10c to 12c/kg, with an improvement in quality in some cases. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"There was an increase in numbers, while quality was very mixed. Yearlings dominated supply with a small offering of grown cattle and a larger than normal percentage of bulls. The condition of the young cattle was on the plain side and more suited to restocker and feeding purposes. The regular processor and trade orders were in attendance.

The young cattle market was variable with quality playing its part. Lightweight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a firm trend with quality affecting average prices. Medium weight steers to restock and feed sold at much cheaper prices; however, this was related to breed quality more than anything. Lightweight yearling heifers to processors sold to a dearer trend, up 13c/kg. Similar weight heifers to restockers sold firm to 7c/kg dearer with the average price change variation due to quality change.

There were too few heavy steers to quote a market trend. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend. The cow market was strong with medium weight cows 6c to 14c/kg dearer. The small penning of heavy cows were firm to 6c/kg dearer. The quality of heavy bulls improved as did the market under spirited bidding, up 12c/kg."
"There was an increase in numbers with yearlings well supplied. There were increased supplies of grown cattle. The quality of the offering was fair to good, with some well bred young cattle along side some secondary quality older cattle. The condition of the offering also varied with a good percentage showing a higher level of finish. The usual buyers were in attendance along with a good restocker presence. Not all export processors operated.

There was quality related price change on a firm to dearer market trend for yearling steers in all weight classes. Light weight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold on a firm to dearer market trend with breed and quality accounting for a large price change. Limited supplies of heavier weights, with no market comparison.

There was good supply of grown steers suitable to feed, again no market comparison from the previous sale. Well finished grown heifers to process sold to a slightly cheaper trend. There were limited numbers of heavy weight cows penned. Despite limited processor competition, demand was high from those participating. This resulted in dearer trends throughout. With the same processors operating the bull market recovered all of the previous sales losses to record a dearer trend of as much as 50c/kg."
"There was an increase in numbers with yearlings and cows well supplied. Vealer numbers remained steady, with the start of the weaner sales happening. The quality of the offering was mixed with condition on the leaner side through the young cattle. The usual processors were in attendance and restocker competition was high. 

Market trends through the young cattle were dearer with the only negative price change due to average quality changes. Vealer steers to restockers were 5c to 10c/kg dearer for the medium and heavy weights and more for light weights under 200kg. Heifer weaners also sold to a dearer trend, however the average quality was down from both a breed and breeding perspective. Strong demand and supply concerns saw medium and heavy weight yearling steers sell to a significantly dearer market trend of 20c/kg and more in places. That market trend was also seen in all weight classes of heifer yearlings to restock.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. The high demand for well finished cattle to process saw grown heifers sell to a dearer trend, up to 15c/kg on breed specific lots. Restocker cows averaged 9c dearer while the 3 and 4 scores to process were 18c to 20c/kg dearer and more in places."
"There was an increase in numbers with vealers and yearlings well supplied along with a fair supply of cows. Overall the quality of the cattle ranged from plain to very good while the condition also varied greatly. The usual buyers were in attendance and there was extra feedlot competition for specific breed steers.

Demand was high for young cattle from both restockers and lot feeders in the face of improving markets and a further rain forecast. Vealer steers to restock sold to a dearer trend of 4c to 8c/kg, with breed quality contributing to greater increases in averages. That was also the case for heifer vealers to restock with the market trend also firm to slightly dearer. There were strong gains for medium and heavy yearling steers to feed. The market trend was 13c to 15c/kg dearer with some greater breed specific price gains. Yearling heifers to feed were as much as 15c/kg dearer.

There were no heavy grown steers penned. Feeder steers carrying at least 2 permanent teeth sold to a dearer trend with price increases similar to the yearlings. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend with the heavy weight class 3c/kg dearer, while the lighter weights experienced greater improvement. There was strong demand for the very mixed quality offering of cows with the market trend dearer, up to 11c/kg on the best heavy weights."
"There was an increase in numbers with this being the last sale until the 6th of January 2011. Included in the offering were quite a few open auction PTIC cows and cows with calves at foot, not included in this report. All regular buyers were in attendance along with good restocker competition.

Lightweight yearling steers to restockers sold firm. The medium weights were 11c/kg dearer with quality adding to the price change. Lightweight heifer yearlings to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, up to 11c/kg with a greater supply and therefore a wider quality range. Light weight heifer yearlings to the trade and processors sold to a slightly cheaper trend. There was strong demand from the trade for heavyweight heifer yearlings with these much dearer.

The quality of the grown steers was plain, particularly the few heavyweights. Medium weight steers to feed with 2 or more teeth were up to 10c/kg dearer. The market for grown heifers showed some variation with the younger 2 tooth heifers selling firm to dearer, while the older 4 and 6 tooth heifers were cheaper. The cow market showed improvement with restocker cows 3c dearer and cows to slaughter 2c to 6c/kg dearer."
"There was an increase in numbers with the quality of the offering very mixed. Heavy weight older cattle were well represented while there enough light and medium weight young cattle to satisfy restockers and feedlotters. A full field of processors operated however there were less restocker and feeder orders in place.

Strong local restocker demand saw light weight steers sell to dearer trends, up by as much as 12c/kg on a fortnight ago. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed saw some quality related improvement on what was a much dearer market trend. Light weight yearling heifers to restock sold to dearer trends while the reduced feedlot and restocker competition saw the medium and heavy weights cheaper.

There was a large supply of older and secondary quality manufacturing steers penned including quite a few Dairy steers. Strong processor competition saw these sell strongly while the well finished grown steers attracted strong competition from QLD processors to record strong gains. The well finished heavy heifers were also keenly sought, also selling to dearer trends. It was a strong cow market in comparison to recent markets albeit most classes showing cheaper trends of as much as 10c/kg. A good supply of bulls sold to cheaper trends."
"There was an increase in numbers with the offering consisting mainly of yearlings and cows. There were some very well finished heavy grown steers also. The quality of the penning was very mixed while condition showed great variation. The same group of buyers from the previous sale were in attendance.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with a noticeable preference from feedlotters for those carrying a bit of extra weight. A small number of vealer steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend while the heifer portion were cheaper. Light and medium weight yearling steers sold on a firm to 10c/kg cheaper trend with quality also contributing. Heavy weight feeder steers over 400kg sold to dearer trends with increases of as much as 30c/kg for breed and quality. Light weight yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends while the medium and heavy weights saw trends dearer.

The increased supply of heavy grown steers to processors sold on a firm to slightly cheaper market trend. The well finished grown heifers went the other way and sold to a much dearer trend. The cow market also sold on a firm to dearer trend with most improvement in the medium weights. The bull market was also a shade dearer."
"There was an increase in numbers with the inclusion of a line of 300 EU accredited PTIC cows and heifers. Grown cattle dominated supply with a good selection of cows and grown heifers beside the feature lines. Heavy grown steers and bullocks were also available in greater numbers. The average quality of the yearling cattle was down. There was a full field of regular buyers in attendance plus a couple of extra orders.

The young cattle market saw cheaper trends throughout and there were also quality related changes to prices. The trend for yearling steers to restock and feed was down 10c to 15c/kg. The increase in average price for the lightweight steers was related to breed quality and weight. Most of the yearling heifers fell into the lightweight category and sold 4c to 14c/kg cheaper with this including a quality component. Prices for medium and heavy heifer yearlings were dearer but mostly related to the low numbers.

The increased number of heavy grown steers were mainly 4 and 6 tooth and older. The market trend was cheaper, down 7c/kg. Apart from the PTIC heifers the grown heifers to processors held value and saw little change. The cow market eased with the trend down 4c to 10c/kg. The bull market was strong selling to a dearer trend. 

The line of PTIC cows and heifers presented in fat condition and carried plenty of weight. Restockers showed confidence in the future and bid strongly on the heifers and the young cows (4 to 6 yrs) at prices in excess of comparable cattle to slaughter. Processors secured the older cows at prices equal to similar cows in the prime market."
"There was an increase in numbers with the inclusion of a large line of very well bred yearling heifers and a PTIC cow herd dispersal.  Vealers and yearlings were well supplied as were cows. There was only a small number of well finished heavy steers. There was a large gallery of buyers with the regular and several additional orders operating. The overall quality of the offering was fair to good with condition mixed. 

The increased competition saw steer vealers to restock sell firm to slightly dearer. Heifer vealers also attracted increased competition and demand to sell to a dearer trend, up 1c to 3c/kg. There was a vast improvement in the quality of the medium weight yearling steers with prices increasing accordingly. Heavy yearling steers also sold to a dearer trend, helped along by increased competition. The general run of yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend to both the trade and restockers. The run of very well bred Angus heifer yearlings in the medium and heavy weight classes all sold to restockers at prices well above the general run.

Quality and a younger age were contributing factors in the dearer prices for heavy steers. Grown heifers also sold to a dearer trend with increased competition. There was a large offering of cows that included quite a few PTIC. Restockers were active on the plainer condition cows and any that were PTIC with the market trend firm. Cows to the processors held mostly firm. The herd dispersal was sold on a dollars per head basis with the sound of mouth cows PTIC making up to $1030/head."
"There was an increase in numbers with some cattle carried into the new financial year. All categories were represented with the exception of heavy grown steers. The quality and condition varied with some well finished heifers and cows off crop. The usual processors were in attendance while there was a little less feedlot competition. Restockers were active throughout.

Market trends through the young cattle were mostly cheaper and there was a quality component to some of the price changes. Medium weight steer vealers to restock averaged 6c/kg cheaper with breed contributing. Light weights were a little dearer. Light weight yearling steers to restockers were cheaper with quality contributing. Medium weight feeders saw a firm to slightly cheaper trend. Heifer yearlings to feed were quite a bit cheaper with limited competition in some weight classes.

Well finished grown heifers were up to 6c/kg cheaper with a drop in average quality contributing to larger price change. Heavy weight cows saw a cheaper trend of 5c to 6c, while the medium weights to process eased 2c to 3c/kg."
"There was an increase in numbers with no sale next week. Vealers were well supplied as were cows and yearling heifers. The overall quality of the offering was fair to good with all buyers well catered for. All the regular buyers were in attendance.

It was a strong market for vealers, both to the trade and to restockers. Steers to restock saw very lightweights firm for the better shape lines, while lightly muscled steers increased substantially. The medium weights sold to a dearer trend, up 5c/kg and more in places, while the heavier weights remained firm. Heifer vealers also sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 14c/kg on the leaner 2 scores to processors and restockers, while the 3 scores remained firm. Quality varied and influenced price changes outside the trends quoted. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend and in some cases being replaced by vealers. Lightweight yearling heifers to restock remained firm with some quality variations. Medium and heavy trade heifers sold to a slightly cheaper trend.

A reduced offering of heavy grown steers sold to a slightly cheaper trend with quality and age also a factor. The cow market varied with the medium weights selling a little easier with odd sales firm. Heavy weight cows sold firm to 3c/kg dearer. The bull market was strong as a result of spirited competition."
"There was an increase in numbers with light weight young cattle and well finished grown cattle well supplied. Overall the quality and condition of the penning varied, the well finished lines showing the benefit of crop. Not all the regular processors and feedlotters were in attendance, however there was the return of a Southern processor. Restocker activity was high.

Strong demand from restockers for light weight young cattle resulted in dearer trends through the vealer and yearling categories. Both steers and heifer classes under 280kg posted strong gains when taking breed quality into account. The medium and heavy weight yearling steers also sold to dearer trends with local restockers competing strongly with the feedlotters. Breed was a factor in the fall in price for some of the yearling heifers. Trends firm to dearer for those to feed.

Well finished heavy weight grown steers sold to dearer trends of 4c to 8c/kg under improved quality and increased competition. The well finished grown heifers to process sold to dearer trends for the most part, with quality and age related price change in places. The quality of the cows was mostly good, Demand was weaker with this resulting in cheaper trends of 14c to 20c/kg. The competition was not as fierce in the bull market with the market trend cheaper by 30c to 40c/kg.

Market reporter, James Armitage"
"There was an increase in numbers with greater supplies of vealers and yearlings, while cow numbers doubled. There were no heavy grown steers with most falling into the feeder category. The quality yarded was fair with well finished yearlings scarce, most of the condition was restricted to grown heifers and cows. The regular orders were in place.

Demand from restockers for lightweight cattle was strong and there were limited opportunities for processors to secure veal requirements. Steer vealers averaged 23c/kg dearer with some sales more. Heifer vealers to processors were dearer by 12c/kg and more in places. Light and medium weight yearling steers sold to a dearer trend with the better quality grades up 26c to 28c/kg. Quality and weight contributed to those price increases. Heifer yearlings sold to a dearer trend, up 5c to 8c/kg and more in places.

There were no heavy steers to quote, while feeder steers sold strongly given the quality of the penning. The best of the grown heifers to process sold to a dearer trend, with average quality affecting some prices. The increased number of cows brought about some quality related changes in a market that saw a dearer trend for heavy cows, up 3c to 5c/kg. Plain condition medium weight cows sold to a dearer trend, up 2c/kg."
"There was an increase in numbers with an influx of feeder cattle and cows. The quality of the offering was mostly good. Condition varied with quite a few very well finished cows and vealers, the majority of the young cattle in ideal condition to feed. There was significant processor and feedlot competition from Queensland. Local restocker competition was a little subdued following disappointing rain events.

Market trends for weaner steers returning to the paddock remained firm, while average quality accounted for negative price changes. The heifer weaners to restock sold on a slightly cheaper trend. Conversely the heifer vealers suitable to the trade sold to a dearer trend. Medium and heavy yearling steers posted strong gains under that northern feedlot influence with the heavy weights as much as 35c/kg dearer. It was a very strong market for all but the plainest light weight yearling heifers with all the feeder heifers attracting substantial price improvement.

The limited supply of well finished heavy grown steers suitable to the processors sold to a much dearer trend. Most of the grown steers were purchased by the feedlots and saw gains equivalent to those of the yearling steers. The extra processor competition equated to a much dearer cow market with the heavy 3 and 4 score cows up by as much as 16c/kg with an improvement in quality adding to the price change. The plainer condition medium weight cows experienced greater increases with a lift in quality also. A few to the restockers were cheaper with quality also not as good."
"There was an increase in numbers with all categories represented. The quality of the offering was very mixed and condition was generally plain. There were limited numbers of well finished young cattle. The same processors were in attendance and there was fair restocker activity however no feedlots operated. Market trends were generally cheaper with the exception being heavy bulls.

With no feedlot competition and subdued restocker demand light and medium weight yearling steers were 9c to 30c/kg cheaper. A drop in quality also contributed to the lower prices. There was little demand from restockers or processors for lightweight yearling heifers with market trends substantially cheaper. Once again quality variations played a role in price change. The average quality for the lightweight C2 heifers to restock improved slightly. The well finished 3 score yearling heifers suitable to the trade met with limited processor demand.

The quality and condition of the heavy grown steers was down and this was reflected in prices. The market trend was cheaper with prices down by 19c/kg on average. There were quite a few plain condition lightweight grown heifers with the 2 tooth lines attracting fair restocker competition. The trend however was significantly cheaper for all classes. The cow market followed the recent trend with prices up to 25c/kg cheaper. Stronger competition for heavy bulls resulted in a dearer trend of 15c to 21c/kg."
"There was an increase in numbers with all categories represented. Quality was mostly good with a large percentage of well bred cattle penned. The condition of the offering varied from fair to very good. There was restricted processor competition, however restocker and feedlot activity was high.

With Spring just around the corner and winter being less than severe restockers were active through the young cattle. Lightweight yearlings sold to significantly dearer market trends. Discounts were applied to the plainer quality young cattle. Medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed were also dearer with some sales improving by as much as 30c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to restockers also showed significant improvement with some breed related premiums.

Grown steers attracted both feedlot and processor competition, an increased supply combined with a vast improvement in quality resulted in substantially dearer pricing levels. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend of as much as 15c/kg in places. There was little change in the cow market, odd pens were ever so slightly dearer. The bull market was firm to slightly dearer with a mostly good quality penning of well finished, heavily muscled bulls penned."
"There was an increase in numbers with a good supply of yearlings along with an increased penning of heavy steers with a few more cows. The quality of the offering was very mixed as was the condition, some very good cows down to very light, plain young cattle. There was increased processor competition with a couple returning after a short absence.

Market trends varied throughout the young cattle with vealers to the trade selling firm to dearer with the better quality heifers up 10c to 20c/kg. Restocker demand was keen on selected lines of light and medium weight yearling steers with those sales improving by 15c to 23c/kg. The balance of the yearling steers to restock and feed saw little but quality related changes. The heifer yearling market also saw some variation, cheaper for the most part, down 3c to 11c/kg and more in places. The very plain condition and quality lightweights were dearer.

The heavy grown steers carried a bit of age for the most part. They sold well with the market trend dearer, however taking the age of the steers into account the price change was negative. The heavy cow market saw a large correction with the trend cheaper, down 10c to 14c/kg."
"There was an increase in numbers this fortnight. Young calves and cows were well supplied along with good numbers of yearlings and grown heifers. Forced sales of breeders and future breeders evident. The quality of the offering was fair to good with condition predominately on the plain side. There were limited supplies of well finished cattle for the processors other than cows. The usual buyers were in attendance along with a good representation of restocker and feedlot buyers.

Demand for young cattle was generally strong. Light weight calves attracted keen interest and sold on a firm market trend. Some of the plainest calves struggled at times though. Light weight yearling steers to restockers sold on a firm to slightly dearer trend, while the heavier weights to feed experienced little change. Yearling heifers to feed remained close to firm. The plainer quality and condition heifer yearlings to restockers saw a firm to slightly dearer market trend.

Grown heifers suitable to feed attracted strong interest with competition strong. There were age and condition related price variations with feeders looking to the younger 2 and 4 tooth lines. Those carrying 6 teeth made similar prices to the plain condition cows. The cow market was solid with the market trends firm to slightly dearer. The better heavy weight cows up to 10c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls attracted strong competition to record similar increases."
"There was an increase in numbers overall. The offering comprised a large percentage of lightweight young cattle. Quality and condition was generally plain through all categories with limited numbers of well bred or finished cattle available. There was restricted export processor competition however the regular feeder and restocker orders were in place. 

Quality contributed to price variations in a market of varying trends. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend however the plain quality contributed to larger price falls. Lightweight heifer yearlings to restock sold to a dearer trend while the heavier weight classes remained close to firm with quality once again contributing to price change. There were insufficient trade cattle to quote. 

The majority of the grown steers were plain quality with a number of lots falling into the manufacturing steer category. They sold at much cheaper prices with quality a major factor. Despite the limited competition well finished cows were only slightly cheaper, while the plainer condition cows were 5c/kg cheaper."
"There was an increase in numbers of 800 head compared to the sale of 2 weeks ago. Vealers made up almost half the yarding with yearlings and cows also in fair supply. Grown steers and heifer numbers were short and the quality of the bull offering was ordinary. All regular buyers were in attendance and there was increased competition on trade vealers and yearling heifers to feed.

Despite the numbers the vealer market held up well. Steers to restock sold at rates equal to last sale, the trend firm. Trade vealers, both steers and heifers. sold to a dearer trend under the increased competition, with 3 scores 10c to 12c/kg dearer. The quality of the 3 score vealers also showed some improvement. Vealer heifers to restock also sold at slightly dearer rates while the 2 scores to process remained firm. A mixed quality offering of yearling steers saw most go to restock and feed, with the light and medium weights remaining firm. The milk tooth steers to feed over 400kg met strong demand with increased numbers available. The trend was 2c/kg dearer. Heifer yearlings were well sought by both feedlots and processors. This created a dearer market trend, with those to restock and feed selling 10c to 11c dearer. Trade yearling heifers in all weight classes were 7c to 10c/kg dearer.

There were few heavy steers to speak of while feeder steers with 2 or more teeth sold to a dearer trend. Grown heifers were firm to dearer for the better quality lots. The 3 and 4 score cow market experienced little change while 2 scores to slaughter sold slightly dearer under pressure from restockers. Restocker cows sold to a dearer trend with the top prices being for PTIC lots."
"There was an increase in numbers in what was a very mixed quality penning. Light weight young cattle well supplied with limited supplies of medium and heavy weights . There were quite a few older cattle penned, mostly heifers while there was a very mixed quality penning of cows. The usual processors were in attendance well supported by local restockers.

Comparing to the sale of a fortnight ago the lightest of the yearling steers to restock sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend. The heavier weight classes however sold to dearer trends. Restocker demand saw all classes of yearling heifers sell to dearer trends.

Strong competition from processors through the grown cattle with well finished heavy grown steers selling to dearer trend while the well finished heifers followed similar trends. There were quite a few secondary quality heifers penned that also sold to dearer trends tho both feedlot orders and processors. The very mixed quality penning of cows attracted strong processor competition with all classes selling to dearer trends. The well finished heavy weights improved by as much as 10c/kg. Well finished heavy bulls sold to a slightly dearer trend."
"There was an increase in numbers from last week, with some very useful overnight rainfalls too late to make a difference to producersâ€™ decision making process. The penning comprised large numbers of plain quality yearlings and grown cattle, as well as some very good quality vealers, grown heifers and cows. There was increased competition from restockers, feedlots and trade buyers, however there was reduced export processor competition. There was a very strong Victorian restocker order operating on the better quality heifer vealers. Market trends were generally dearer due to the increased competition and higher demand, however heavy cows sold to a cheaper trend.

Improved quality contributed to dearer trends in the vealer classes, with the steers to restock up to 9c/kg dearer. Increased competition and quality improvements saw vealer heifers sell to a dearer trend, as much as 35c/kg higher. The better quality C muscled lightweight yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend, up 11c/kg. Secondary quality lightweight steers saw a significantly greater increase in price. The dearer trend carried through to the yearling heifers, although there were some quality related price variations.

Heavy grown steers to process sold to a dearer trend, taking quality into account. There was a line of plain quality and condition grown steers showing little weight for age that sold to restocker and feedlot interests at dearer prices. Well finished grown heifers sold on a firm to dearer trend. Plain quality and condition grown heifers also sold to restockers and feedlots at dearer prices. Medium weight cows attracted restocker competition to sell to a dearer trend, while the heavy cows met a cheaper trend of 5c to 9c/kg from reduced processor competition. Heavy bulls also sold to a cheaper trend."
"There was an increase in numbers for the first sale of the new financial year. Young cattle were well supplied in what was a very mixed quality penning. There were some well finished yearlings and heavy grown steers penned, however the large supplies of cows seems to be easing. There was limited processor competition in both the trade and export cattle, however there was increased restocker activity.

There were varying trends in the young cattle sale, as the very mixed nature of the offering brought about some large price variations. Light weight vealer steers to restock generally sold to a cheaper trend, however the better quality lots were a little dearer. Heifer vealers to both processors and restockers sold to a cheaper trend. Yearling steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend with the better quality, sought after breeds least affected. Yearling heifers attracted increased restocker competition, however this did not equate to dearer trends with the market close to firm, with only some quality related changes.

Heavy grown steers attracted less competition also to sell to a cheaper trend, down 8c/kg on average. Well finished grown heifers also experienced reduced competition. The cow market saw cheaper trends, with a very poor quality penning of lightweights most affected. The better 3 and 4 score cows saw minimal change. The bull market was considerably cheaper, returning to levels of two weeks ago as a result of less competition."
"There was an increase in numbers following a week of heavy frost which has cut feed quality dramatically. The average quality of the yarding was fair with lines of well bred and well fattened cattle available. Heifer weaners were in big numbers as were medium and lightweight steers, but trade heifers and cows were yarded in many less numbers than in earlier sales. All the usual and regular buyers were in attendance. 

Heifer vealers were again in strong demand to be 1c or 2c/kg dearer while the steer portion sold at the same rates to restockers as they have for the earlier part of the season. Light yearling steers sold at fully firm prices with the majority going to restockers and not to kill. Heifer yearlings to the trade were also very well received in the market, but were few in number.

There were better bullocks yarded and they sold right up to the mark with the heaviest pens making the most cents per kilogram. The off type in the older steers showed a weakening in price of up to 4c and 5c/kg which is a trend that has been repeated in some northern sales throughout the week.

The cow  prices slipped with all but the cows to restockers displaying falls in value of 4c to 5c/kg as the enquiry weakens. It has been stated by some buyers that yields are dropping in the cold weather which would account for the fall in price."
"There was an increase in numbers despite all the recent rain. Cow numbers increased and there was a good selection of young cattle. There was a small number of heavy grown steers, while grown heifers were well supplied. The overall quality and condition of the offering was fair to good. The regular processors were in attendance and restockers were active.

Vealers sold to a dearer trend with trade up 1c and steers to restockers up 7c/kg. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed eased, however this was quality related. The better quality well-bred steers sold at similar prices to the previous sale. Heavyweight yearling steers attracted strong restocker competition to sell much dearer, up 13c to 20c/kg. There was little change in the market for C2 lightweight heifer yearlings to restock and process. The well finished 3 scores to the trade averaged 4c/kg dearer.

Heavy grown steers sold firm to 2c/kg cheaper. The larger offering of grown heifers saw an improvement in quality and this accounted for much of the price increase in what was generally a firm market trend. Medium weight cows sold from firm to slightly cheaper. The increased numbers also had an effect on average quality with this contributing to cheaper prices. A very good quality offering of heavy cows with some outstanding C muscles penned. Prices were firm with high expected yields contributing to higher prices."
"There was an increase in numbers after the previous weekâ€™s very small offering. Yearlings made up the bulk of the offering and there was a fair supply of grown heifers. The overall quality was fair and condition varied. 

Restockers were once again active on young cattle with the market for both steers and heifers remaining firm. Price changes related to quality only. Well finished heifer yearlings to the trade sold firm to dearer with the increased numbers bringing about a drop in average quality which accounted for no change in the average price.

A very small offering of heavy steers sold to a dearer trend. Grown heifers with 2 or more teeth also sold to a dearer trend, up 2c/kg. The small number of cows sold firm to 2c/kg dearer."
"There was an increase in number this fortnight as the weather heats up and feed dries off. All categories were represented, while quality and condition was very mixed. Overall both were well down on the previous sale. There was reduced processor and feedlot competition, however one export processor re- entered the market. Restockers were still active.

Demand from both restockers and feedlotters was weaker. This resulted in cheaper trends through most classes of young cattle. The best of the vealer steers to restockers remained firm, with the heifer portion cheaper. Trade vealers saw a cheaper trend of 10c to 20c/kg. All classes of yearling steers to restock and feed saw trends cheaper with quality variations accounting for some substantial price change. The better quality steers to feed were least affected. Yearling heifers followed similar trends, up to 20c/kg cheaper the better quality lots over 280kg. Those to the trade also saw trends cheaper.

Despite the reintroduction of one major processor, demand for export cattle was weak. This combined with a vast reduction in quality saw heavy grown steers to process show significantly cheaper trends. This followed through to the well finished grown heifers. Reduced competition saw the cow market from 50c to 60c/kg cheaper in the fortnight, with heavy bulls also showing a significantly cheaper trend."
"There was an increase in consignments despite a significant rain event across most of the district. All categories were represented although weaners and cows made up the bulk. Quality was mixed throughout as was condition. There were some well finished cattle penned, mostly in the heavier weight grades. The usual processors were in attendance along with a strong restocker presence.

Confidence boosted by the rain saw restockers very active. Demand was high through most categories and resulted in dearer trends. Weaner steers saw gains of 20c to 30c/kg. Breeds contributed to higher average prices. The heifer weaners were up to 8c/kg dearer with breed again contributing to higher averages. Light weight yearling steers experienced significant price improvements while the heavy weights returning to the paddock averaged 4c/kg dearer. Secondary quality yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend with the better quality heifers remaining firm. 

Well finished heavy steers and heifers sold to a dearer trend with a breed specific order very strong. These cattle sold to a dearer trend. Plain condition cows remained firm while the well finished medium and heavy cows saw a firm to 10c/kg dearer market with quality improving in some cases."
"There was an apparent increase in numbers this week in what was probably the best quality lineup of cattle seen in Armidale during the winter months. There were some very well finished yearlings and cows on offer.

The quality of the yearling and and vealer cattle on offer helped to lift the market for most of the grades. The low numbers last week contributed to some negative price variations, these changes were purely a quality variation. There were no trade yearling steers last week to make a comparison too with the heifer yearlings selling to a dearer trend of 1c to 3c/kg.  Light veal sold at very strong rates with numbers of these cattle hard to procure. 

Restocker steers met with very strong competition and was also helped by the improved quality and sold at rates up to 10c/kg dearer.

The export section of the yarding saw some good lines of quality cows on offer with a small number of 6 tooth bullocks offered. There were also increased numbers of older heifers on offer with a slight improvement in quality."
"There was a very wide range in breed quality and in condition in the yarding. Cattle off crop or grain were yarded in each category but there was also a fair percentage of light and very light conditioned stock. Yearlings and cows were in the greatest numbers and heavy steers and feeder steers were also well represented. Trade weight cattle and vealers continued to be short supplied.

The market was steady even with one regular buyer not in attendance. Light feeder steers and restocker yearling steers all sold at fully firm rates while there were a few pens of heifer vealers that sold at dearer prices due to the shortage of numbers available.

Feeder steers over 400kg were cheaper as most were in lighter condition and less attractive to feedlotters. Heavy steers and bullocks to slaughter sold at fully firm rates as did all descriptions in the cow offering. Bull quality was well down on last sale but prices remained steady. Demand from restockers was again steady and those prices remained unchanged.

The top sale price was 145.8c/kg paid for light weight and well finished bullocks."
"There was a very sudden drop in the average quality of all, except for the cows. The heifer weaners and the cows made up a very large part of the offering. Weaner steers and heavy steers and bullocks were in light supply. The cows were very good quality and yield for half the offering, but very plain and light for the balance. 

There were increases in price recorded in a number of different descriptions. Heifer weaners sold to a much stronger demand to record fair price rises while some of the best of the trade cattle and medium feeder steers showed a similar increase. Some of the plain and light weaner steers and yearling steers sold to slightly dearer rates, with restocker demand a little stronger as some local growers take the risk on rain.

The heavy steers and bullocks sold at almost firm prices but the quality was down and the yield potential was very much lower. The highlight  of the sale was the big rise seen in the price of all weights of cows with extra competition increasing prices by up to 15c and 16c and averaging 12c/kg higher on all the better yielding types. Light cows showed an average rise of 7c/kg. The bull market was unchanged.

The top sale price was 169.6c/kg paid by a restocker for very light steer weaners."
"There was a very substantial improvement in the quality of the yarding overall. Light calves that have been selling in big numbers were surprisingly less in numbers while trade cattle were very short in supply. There were not many feeder steers or heavy steers and bullocks yarded and yearlings and cows made up by far the greatest proportion of the numbers. All the usual buyers attended the sale.

The trend in the market was firm to dearer. The light calves and the very light yearlings met a stronger restocker demand and some prices were dearer by 10c to 20c/kg with the slaughter element holding fully firm. There were hardly enough trade cattle available to form a market. Restockers dominated the buying on yearlings following last weekends light to medium rainfall in parts of the district.

The very few heavy steers and bullocks sold at firm rates while the major improvement in the market was the cows of all weights which gained between 6c and 12c/kg under a keener enquiry. Feeder steers were slightly dearer while bulls remained fully firm.

The top sale price was 142.2c/kg paid for a small pen of light bullocks."
"There was a very small reduction in supply with this being the second last sale before the Christmas beak. A sale to be held on the 12th. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering along with a fair supply of grown heifers and bulls. The quality of the offering was very mixed. There was reduced export processor attendance however restocker and feedlot activity increased.

Strong restocker demand in the face of an excellent season saw the light weight steers sell to a dearer trend. The medium and heavy weight yearling steers also reaped the benefit of increased competition to sell to a dearer trend of 4c to 10c/kg. Heavy weights destined for the shorter fed programs were keenly sought. Market trends for the light and medium weight yearling heifers were firm to slightly cheaper with the better quality lots least affected.

Well finished heavy grown heifers to processors sold to cheaper trends with reduced competition. The better quality feeder heifers were slightly dearer while the secondary heifers were cheaper. A strong cow market saw trends firm to slightly dearer. An improvement in quality accounted for an odd dearer sale on heavy bulls, the market generally firm despite the absence of one processor."
"There was a very small penning with this weeks sales falling on the off week. The quality of the cattle was fair to good with some very good cows and weaners. The usual buyers were in attendance, however not all processors got a start due to the lack of supply. Sales will go back to fortnightly going forward. 

Vealers going to restockers sold to a cheaper trend with some weight related price change. There were insufficient yearlings to quote a trend. 

Heavy grown steers to process sold to a cheaper trend with the odd better grown heifers a little dearer. There was strong demand for cows that saw a dearer trend of as much as 10c/kg. Heavy bulls remained firm. 

Market Reporter, James Armitage."
"There was a very small penning again this week, with the quality of the offering extremely mixed. There were some very plain light weight young cattle and cows, along with a number of pens of well bred yearlings and heavy cows. Most of the usual buyers were in attendance.

Quality determined most of the price changes through the young cattle. The very plain, very light vealers and yearlings were significantly cheaper. The well bred and good quality yearlings sold to a dearer trend, with heifers predominately attracting stronger restocker and feedlot competition. The trend was dearer by more than 18c/kg.

Well finished grown heifers to processors sold to dearer trends ,with an increase in numbers and an improvement in quality. There were strong gains in the cow market, with the plainer condition medium weights selling up to 12c/kg dearer. The heavy weight 3 and 4 score cows were as much as 18c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls sold to dearer trends.

Due to the low numbers, sales will be held on a fortnightly basis until further notice."
"There was a very small offering, which is a trend likely to continue for a few months. The quality offered was fairly plain with few cattle showing sufficient fat cover for the trade. Not all regular orders were in place.

It was difficult to obtain an accurate market trend as quality played a major part in a lot of the grades. Taking this into account, restockers showed confidence in the coming spring with restocker yearling steers firm to dearer. The majority were lightweight of average to plain quality. Heifer yearlings followed a similar trend with average quality. The heifers that were purchased by processors were mostly plain quality and condition.

There were very few heavyweight steers of plain quality as this saw an easing in values. Grown heifers carrying their permanent teeth were very plain in quality and condition and sold at cheaper rates. A specialist restocker order for a specific line of cows saw those cows sell to a much dearer trend. The balance of the cow market was firm to cheaper, with a drop in quality being the attributing factor."
"There was a very small offering, the smallest for the year. Quality was plain for the most part with the majority of the cattle carrying little finish. There were a few well finished heifer yearlings and cows in the offering. Not all buyers were in attendance due to the lack of supply.

The young cattle market experienced cheaper trends through all grades with the quality of the cattle adding to some price falls. Light weight yearling steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 10c to 15c/kg. The medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed followed a similar trend. Heifer yearlings also sold cheaper, down 6c to 12c/kg.

There were insufficient heavy steers to frame a trend, while the cow market cheapened down 9c to 14c/kg."
"There was a very small offering which is usual at this time of the year. A forecast for some useful rain over the next couple of days was also a contributing factor. There was a smaller than usual panel of buyers for a mixed quality offering of which 50% were yearling heifers. There were also 24 bulls penned.

The young cattle market was driven by quality with very few steers penned. They sold to restockers at reduced rates although an odd steer remained firm. The majority of the yearling heifers were purchased by restockers and feeders at firm rates. There were some very well finished trade yearling heifers that sold to restricted competition at rates below last week.

There were few heavyweight steers to speak of while the well finished cows sold firm. Plain condition cows to slaughter also sold at firm rates while plain cows to restockers were dearer. The best heavyweight bulls sold dearer for quality."
"There was a very small offering to start proceedings for the New Year. All grades were represented in a mixed quality penning. The regular trade and export processors were in attendance and there was a small but active gallery of restockers.

The vealer steers penned all fell into the lightweight class and sold to restockers at dearer prices than the pre-Christmas sale. There was an increased supply of heifer vealers penned and they also sold dearer. The quality of the yearling steers to restock and feed was mixed and reflected in prices, the trend was generally firm with quality accounting for price change. Heifer yearlings to the trade sold to a dearer trend with the best improving by 3c/kg.

There was a fair supply of heavy grown steers with most having been HGP treated. The market trend was firm to 5c/kg dearer. Despite a full field of buyers the cow market opened with prices cheaper although the limited numbers did not see all buyers able to get a start."
"There was a very small decrease in numbers and quality was mixed. Once again young cattle made up the bulk of the offering with no heavyweight steers. Cows and grown heifers were in fair numbers and there were a small number of grown steers suitable to feed.

Demand for light cattle was very strong, both from restockers and processors. This demand saw vealers sell as much as 20c/kg dearer. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend, up 5c to 8c/kg. The lightweight heifer yearlings suitable to the trade sold 5c to 15c/kg dearer and more in places. The C muscle lightweight heifers to restock did not attract as much competition as the previous sale and sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c/kg. A line of lightly muscled lightweight heifers attracted good competition from restockers and sold at much dearer rates. The 3 score trade heifers remained firm.

Grown steers sold to a dearer trend as the grown heifers held firm to 4c/kg dearer. Plain condition cows to restock and process sold at much dearer rates while the better conditioned cows remained firm."
"There was a very mixed quality yarding of 1330, with another 440 store cattle sold at the end. Most cattle were not up to last sale standard, and very few heavy steers and only one pen of light bullocks were on offer. A full field of Buyers attended, creating a fully firm market for all the young slaughter cattle but cows, the best bulls and the small offerring of heavy steers showed a slightly weaker trend after a few weeks of improvement in price.

Restock yearling and weaner cattle were basically firm but with a number of the best quality pens providing small price rises."
"There was a very mixed quality offering to start the New Year. All grades were represented although young cattle and cows made up the biggest percentages. Not all regular buyers were in attendance although this had no effect on young cattle, with cows and bulls only showing any negative effects.

Young cattle were well sought with processors and restockers competing very strongly on light weight vealers and yearlings. For the first time in many months processors were out bidding restockers on suitable steer lines. The resulting market trend saw vealer steers to slaughter sell to a dearer trend, up 20c/kg with restocker vealer steers showing little change. Processors competed amongst themselves on the heifer vealers with the market 25c to 30c/kg dearer.

The better quality yearling steers to restockers saw little change however the plainer quality light steers sold to a dearer trend, up 15c to 20c/kg and more in places. Feeder interests competed strongly on yearling heifers with the market 10c to 14c/kg dearer. Light trade heifers also sold to a dearer trend; up 12c to 17c/kg with the lightest showing the best rises. Medium weight trade heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 5c/kg.

There was little change in the market for heavy steers, all selling in the pre Christmas range. It was a similar story for the grown heifers. With competition limited the cow market was the only market to show a negative trend, down 3c to 10c/kg."
"There was a surprising increase in numbers for so late in the season saw a yarding of 2120, by far the biggest offering this season. Quality was below last sale on the weaner calves of both sexes, it was similar on yearling cattle and heavy steers and bullocks and a little better on the best cows.
           
The 2 score steer calves as well as vealer steers and heifers were cheaper after so many weaner sales recently have provided plenty of cattle for the local demand. The best trade cattle were firm to a little stronger in a few sales. Heavy export cattle of all descriptions were dearer under very keen competition from a full field of Buyers, and were 2, and up to 4 cents dearer. Some of that rise, particularily on cows was the result of a better yield."
"There was a smaller yarding, due to the reduction in the numbers of advertised store cattle, which pushed numbers up on the previous sale. Quality of the yarding was improved with more finished cattle. Export cattle were well supplied even though most of the bullocks available were older manufacturing cattle. Restocker yearling steers were short supplied, but there were a few more vealers and weaners yarded for the first of the season.

Buying orders were well represented particularly in young cattle, but the market trends varied. Vealers and weaner cattle showed a dearer tendency, while domestic feeder steers were fully firm. Most of the yearling heifers either to slaughter or to feed on were cheaper by 5c/kg. There were no tradeweight steers bought and most in the weight range went to feedlots.

The older manufacturing bullocks sold at fully firm rates, while the cow price varied between firm and 3c/kg dearer. Bull prices were dearer by 7c while the heavier export feeder steers sold to 6c/kg dearer under a strong demand for quality."
"There was a smaller yarding of 249 head, with young cattle making up the largest percentage of the yarding, along with an odd pen of grown heifers and cows. It was a very plain conditioned yarding of cattle, although there were some well-bred cattle through the sale.

The market continued to be strong with restockers taking most of the cattle that were offered. Restocker weaner steers sold to a top of 476c and restocker weaner heifers topped at 428c/kg. Restocker yearling steers sold to a top of 428c and the heifers sold to 373c/kg.  

Grown heifers to slaughter topped at 298c and best of the cows sold to a top of 264c/kg."
"There was a smaller yarding and condition was similar with lightweight heifers in the greater percentage of the yarding. The young steers were purchased by restockers and there were 6 bulls penned.  

The young heifers were all in lightweight condition and sold 6c/kg dearer to northern processors, with restockers picking up an odd pen. Restockers paid 8c /kg less for young steers.

A few grown heifers sold at similar levels selling from 148c to 160c/kg.  A small pen of cows sold for 131c/kg."
"There was a smaller penning with a reduced offering of vealers. The overall quality was mixed with well finished good quality cattle throughout most categories. The regular processors were in attendance, however not all operated.

Trends varied through the young cattle with steer vealers to restockers selling to a cheaper trend, down 8c to 17c/kg. The best of the light and medium weight heifer vealers remained firm with an odd slightly dearer sale. The secondary vealers were cheaper. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold firm to dearer with breed quality contributing to odd dearer sales. Heavy yearling steers to restock and feed saw little but quality related price changes. Light and medium weight yearling heifers to restock and feed met with variable trends, much of the variation depending on weight and breed quality. Heifers to the trade were cheaper.

There was an increased penning of heavy grown steers, with this bringing about average quality changes. The market trend was cheaper, down 7c to 8c/kg. Grown heifers also sold to a cheaper trend. The cow market was cheaper with medium weights averaging down by 4c to 7c/kg. The heavy weight cows experienced the greatest falls in price with the trends cheaper by as much as 10c/kg."
"There was a smaller penning offered to all the regular buyers. Overall the quality of the offering was plain with young cattle making up the bulk. There were a few good cows and a small number of heavy grown steers. Demand for all classes was high, resulting in a dearer market trend throughout.

The quality of the young cattle offered was generally plain with only a small number of well bred yearling steers available. The vealers were very plain and carried little weight. They sold at cheaper prices due to the quality. Light yearling steers sold to a dearer trend of 16c/kg and more in places with lightweights a driving force in prices paid. There was a single pen of medium weight steers that sold at 210c/kg. The lightweight yearling heifers consisted of mainly light muscled lots carrying little weight. The market for these cattle showed significant improvement with restocker and processors competing strongly, once again the lightweights were the highlight of the market.

The single pen of heavy grown steers sold 2c/kg dearer. The cow market experienced a firm to dearer trend, with medium weights up to 6c/kg dearer. The heavy cows lifted 3c/kg. Quality variations accounted for any other price change."
"There was a smaller offering of plain condition, fair quality cattle offered. The majority of the offering was unfinished with only a small percentage of finished cattle penned. Those cattle either came off crop or were supplementary fed. Not all regular processing and feedlot orders were in attendance although restockers were active despite the quality of the offering. The market for the plain quality and condition cattle eased while the few finished cattle sold firm to slightly dearer.

Lightweight vealer steers to restockers were 5c cheaper, reaching 200c/kg for the better quality. The plainer quality lots showed a greater fall. Heifer vealers, most of which lacked freshness, sold much cheaper, down 16c to 22c/kg. Lightweight yearling steers to restockers were firm to 2c cheaper while the medium weights fell by 14c/kg. The plainer quality and condition heifer yearlings experienced the greatest fall, selling 12c to 20c/kg cheaper. Limited numbers of well finished yearling heifers sold to the trade at firm to dearer rates, up to 6c/kg.

There was a very small offering of heavy grown steers with the market showing a cheaper trend, this trend continued through to the grown heifers, while cows were firm to 5c/kg cheaper."
"There was a smaller offering of mixed quality cattle penned, with the condition overall on the plain side. The cattle showing finish lacked a bit of yield, although this is not uncommon at this time of the year. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market that saw prices change on quality.

Vealer steers to restockers dropped in quality, with the market selling to a cheaper trend down 7c/kg. Heifer vealers to both restockers and the trade were cheaper by 1c/kg. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders saw light and medium weights sell firm to slightly dearer, with the quality not up to last week. The limited number of heavyweight feeder steers sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Heifer yearlings sold firm to 9c/kg dearer.

There were increased numbers of heavyweight steers of mixed quality. The majority of these steers were down on yield. There were no steers last week to make a comparison to. Restockers were active on the plain condition cows with the market showing a dearer trend, while quality was down. Cows to the processors sold to a dearer trend with the better condition cows improving by up to 10c/kg."
"There was a small reduction in numbers. The yarding comprised a big percentage of lightweight calves, vealers and yearlings with a small number of heavy steers and a fair supply of cows. For the first time in a long period water issues forced a number of cattle on to the market, mainly cows and split calves. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market that saw most grades sell to a cheaper trend. There were some exceptions.

There was a better quality offering of calves penned however the market trend was 4c to 8c/kg cheaper with the quality minimizing the average price change. Vealers followed a similar trend. Restockers were active on lightly muscled lightweight yearling steers at much dearer rates, up to 30c/kg. Lightweight C muscles sold to restockers at slightly dearer rates, up 2c/kg. The medium and heavy yearling steers to feed sold to a cheaper trend, while those to restock sold slightly dearer. Lightweight heifer yearlings to the trade sold to a cheaper trend, averaging 1c/kg softer. Yearling heifers to restockers also sold cheaper, down 1c to 7c/kg. A small number of C3 trade heifers sold slightly cheaper.

Heavy steers sold to a cheaper trend with quality also down. Grown heifers were cheaper with feedlots active on those showing sufficient frame to carry heavyweights. There were quite a few small to medium frame, plain condition cows penned. The market showed a cheaper trend with the better condition cows down 2c to 3c/kg and those plain cows a bit more. Heavy bulls sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 6c/kg."
"There was a small reduction in numbers. The offering featured quite a few well finished medium and heavy weight cows, along with some high quality vealers. The quality of the offering was fair to very good, while the condition showed improvement on recent weeks. Processors were well catered for. There was a full field of processors operating and restocker activity was strong through all categories.

Varying trends through the young cattle. Light weight vealer steers to restockers sold to cheaper trends. The medium and heavy weights firm to dearer with the heavier weights showing the greatest improvement. Light weight heifer vealers also sold to cheaper trends. The medium weights were as much as 25c/kg dearer with increased competition. There was a good supply of well finished heavy weights suitable to the trade. Light and medium weight yearling steers were only slightly dearer. Heavy weight yearling steers attracted strong competition from both feedlotters and restockers to experience strong gains. Yearling heifers also sold to dearer trends with price improvement through all weight classes.

Grown steers to restock and feed experienced significant improvement. The limited supply to process remained firm. Well finished grown heifers were much dearer to process with feedlotters also competing strongly. Medium weight cows sold to dearer trends, while the heavy weight cows remained firm. Strong competition saw the better quality heavy bulls sell to dearer trends."
"There was a small reduction in numbers. Once again cows and young cattle made up the bulk of the offering while there were increased numbers of grown steers suitable for feedlotters. There was reduced processor attendance, one from the export section and one from the young cattle. The overall quality of the offering was quite mixed and in some cases below the previous week, while condition tended to be on the plainer side.

Varying trends were evident through the young cattle. Steer vealers to restock saw great variation as there were no exceptional sales recorded compared to last week. The better quality light and medium weights remained close to firm, while the secondary lots sold to a cheaper trend. Quality variations and a lack of follow-up rain were a factor in price variations. Reduced processor and restocker competition saw heifer vealers sell to a cheaper trend with the exception of a few well finished 3 scores suitable to the trade. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold firm to dearer taking quality into account. Heifer yearlings followed a similar trend with a greater number of well-bred heifers albeit plain in condition and lacking muscle definition.

Grown steers to feed sold to a dearer trend with well-bred 2 and 4 tooth lots making little more than the secondary quality pens on a cents per kilogram basis. There were quality variations evident in the cow market where trends were generally dearer. For the most part lessor quality cows in both the plain condition and well finished classes made as much if not more than the previous week with the plainest lines showing the best of the increase."
"There was a small reduction in numbers. All categories were represented. The quality of the offering was fair to good as was condition. There was increased domestic processor attendance along with the usual export processor competition. There was increased restocker activity with minimal feedlot competition.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with vealers purchased by restockers selling to cheaper trends.  Breed and quality accounted for some of the price change. Medium weight yearling steers to restock sold to cheaper trends. The heavy weights all purchased by restockers sold to dearer trends with breed a factor in some cases. Well finished heavy weight heifer yearlings to the trade sold to a dearer trend under increased competition. The heifers to restockers sold to a slightly cheaper trend.

Heavy grown steers to process sold strongly however no market comparison is available. The well finished grown heifers saw a firm to slightly dearer trend. Strong demand for an improved quality penning of cows resulted in a dearer trend with some classes showing strong gains due to the improvement in quality.

Market reporter; James Armitage"
"There was a small reduction in numbers, with vealers and cows once again making up the bulk of the offering. The quality of the young cattle was good, however most were showing the effects of the cold weather. There were some well-finished yearling heifers and cows penned. A full field of processor buyers were in attendance and there was strong restocker demand.

The young cattle market saw trends mostly dearer, with vealer steers to restock averaging 10c to 12c/kg dearer. There was little change in the market for the better quality lines, with the lift in the market seen in the secondary lines. There were only some quality related changes in the vealer heifer market. Increased competition saw yearling steers to restock and feed sell to a dearer trend. This trend was seen in the yearling heifers to restock, with odd sales showing strong price gains. Well-finished heifers were sought after by both the trade and finishers to average 4c to 6c/kg dearer, some sales showing significant increases.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. Heavy well-finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. There was a slightly dearer trend for the best of the heavyweight cows. The light and medium weight cows also sold to a dearer trend, with average quality also improving, contributing to prices lifting by 7c to 9c/kg on average."
"There was a small reduction in numbers, although vealer and calf supplies increased as producers weaned early into the yards to give cows a better chance. All other categories were represented in a mixed quality offering. The usual buyers were in attendance.

It was a variable young cattle market with vealers mostly firm and quality accounting for any price changes. An isolated pen of steer vealers sold to restockers at dearer levels. Lightweight yearling steers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend, down 9c/kg. The quality of the plainer D muscle steers was responsible for the lift in average prices. Medium weight yearling steers were firm due to quality changes. Heifer yearlings to restock sold to a dearer trend for light weights, while medium weights remained firm.

There was little but quality related changes on the heavy grown steers. The cow market saw a cheaper trend with medium weights down 2c to 4c/kg. A better average quality penning of heavy cows saw positive price changes in an otherwise slightly cheaper market."
"There was a small reduction in numbers with yearlings well supplied. There were in creased numbers of well finished heavy grown steers and heifers, however cow numbers were well down. Overall the quality of the offering was quite mixed, with some very well bred lines alongside secondary quality lots. The usual processors were in attendance and there was strong restocker and feedlot activity.

Restocker demand was very high through the young cattle with a number of orders competing with feedlotters on heavier weights. Market trends were dearer throughout. Light weight yearling steers to restock experienced a substantially dearer trend when taking quality into account. Medium weight feeders were as much as 16c dearer with those to restockers improving by as much as 25c/kg. Heavy weights to restock and feed firm to dearer with those to restockers showing the greatest improvement. There were strong gains on light weight yearling heifers to restockers, as much as 21c/kg and more for quality. The medium and heavy weights to feed also sold to a dearer trend with some quality related price change.

There was an improvement in quality and weight in the grown steers. Demand increased with the market trend as much as 30c/kg dearer. Well finished grown heifers also sold to dearer trends. Processor demand for heavy weight cows was high with the market trend slightly dearer, noticeable particularly on those at the top end of the condition scores. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend, as much as 20c/kg on an improved quality penning."
"There was a small reduction in numbers with vealers and yearlings well supplied and cows making up the bulk of the grown cattle. The quality and condition of the offering was mostly good. There was a notable absentee in the processor ranks, with a couple of extras filling the gap. Restockers and feedlots were also active. 

Strong restocker demand resulted in dearer trends through the vealer steers, coupled with some quality related price change. Feedlots competed on the heavier weights while vealer heifers to restock saw a firm to dearer trend, with the few going to the trade substantially dearer. Medium weight yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold to a dearer trend with demand increasing. Heavy weight feeder steers saw breed and quality related price change on a mostly firm market trend. Yearling heifers to feed sold to a slightly cheaper trend. In comparison, heavy weight heifers to the trade attracted strong competition to show a significantly dearer trend and an improvement in quality. 

Heavy grown steers to process saw stronger competition and the market trend held firm to dearer as a result. Well finished grown heifers followed a similar trend. There was little change in the market for the better quality cows, however, lots at the top of the condition scores saw a cheaper trend. Heavy weight bulls also sold to a cheaper trend. 

Market Reporter, James Armitage."
"There was a small reduction in numbers with this trend likely to continue over the coming months. Plain condition cattle made up the bulk of the offering with limited numbers of young cattle carrying much condition. There were a few well finished grown heifers and cows, while there were insufficient heavy steers to quote. The regular buyers were in attendance.

Restockers bought most of the young cattle with little change in the market trend. Price changes are attributed to quality variations. The few young cattle purchased by processors and the trade remained firm.

Good demand from processors saw well finished grown heifers sell to a dearer trend, up to 10c/kg dearer. There were no heavy grown steers to quote, while the quality of the grown steers to restock and feed was plain. The cow market was slightly dearer with some quality related price change."
"There was a small reduction in numbers with less vealers and yearling steers penned. The quality offered was very mixed throughout all grades and there were large percentages of plain condition cattle. The regular orders were in place.

Some good rain throughout the area led to greater demand for young cattle from restockers, particularly vealers and plain condition lightweight yearling steers. The market for steer vealers was dearer, up 7c to 10c/kg. The better muscled light and medium weight yearling steers sold to a cheaper trend, as buyers opted for the younger steers. Secondary quality lightweight yearling steers were dearer with the dollars per head prices attractive to buyers. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed strengthened to show a dearer trend, up 8c to 14c/kg. Heifers to the trade also sold to a dearer trend.

Heavy grown steers were dearer, up 5c/kg. The quality and condition of the cows offered was very mixed, with large numbers of very light and medium weights penned. These cows attracted strong competition from restockers and sold to a dearer trend. This trend carried through with cows averaging 3c to 5c/kg dearer."
"There was a small reduction in numbers to 690 head. Yearlings were well supplied while there were a small number of heavy grown steers and well finished grown heifers. Cows were well supplied and there were quite a few bulls. The quality of the offering was fair to good while condition was very mixed. The usual buyers were in attendance along with an extra cow order.

With a month before Spring and numbers waning the demand for yearling steers increased. The light and medium weights sold to dearer trends of as much as 12c/kg. The heavy and extra heavy weight feeder steers also sold to dearer trends up slightly while there was some breed and quality related price change. Steers weighing in excess of 480 kg selling from 240c to 340c/kg depending on breed and quality. Light weight yearling heifers to restock saw a firm to slightly dearer trend while medium weights to restock and feed saw trends firm to a shade cheaper.

Well finished heavy grown steers in limited numbers sold to cheaper trends to processors. A fair supply of lightly muscled grown heifers in plain condition attracted strong competition from feeders. The extra order had a positive impact on the cow market with trends generally as much as 10c/kg dearer. The heavy bull market also saw a dearer trend."
"There was a small reduction in numbers this week. Female cattle dominated supply as producers continue to offload breeders and replacemants. The quality of the offering was very mixed, however there were not as many of the very plain young cattle of the previous week. The usual processors were in attendance, some operating to a limited capacity. Restockers were again active, with southern interest strong.

Demand for young calves from restockers was very strong with this resulting in a dearer trend of as much as 40c/kg on the better quality lots. A reduced supply of yearling steers met with weaker demand to show a significantly cheaper trend. There was an increase in weight in a lot of cases with this also affecting prices. The heavier C muscle steers lacked the overall quality of the previous week with this impacting price on a cheaper market trend. Yearling heifers to restock and feed saw a much cheaper market trend for the most part, the plain light weights impacted by the same factors as the steers. Odd well bred heifers lacking condition and muscling attracted keen interest from both restockers and feedlotters to maintain a firm market trend.

There were very few well finished heavy grown steers suitable to processors. A single pen of heavy steers attracted strong feedlot competition. Well finished grown heifers sold to cheaper trends under reduced processor and feedlot competition. Plain condition grown heifers mostly sold to cheaper trends, the exception being a couple of pens of well bred lines that attracted strong support from restockers and feedlotters. There was increased restocker and feedlot competition on plain condition cows. There was also a variation in quality. This having a greater effect on average prices than the fall in the market. The 1 and 2 score cows sold to a slightly cheaper trend, while the well finished cows were as much as 30c/kg cheaper as processors struggle under weight of numbers. A bright spot in the market were the heavy bulls, they sold to a dearer trend of as much as 13c/kg"
"There was a small reduction in numbers from the last sale before the Christmas break. All categories were represented. The quality of the offering was mixed, while condition varied from plain to very good. There was a fair supply of early vealers, while yearlings were also well supplied. The usual processors and feedlotters were in place, however the extra competition from before Christmas did not return. Restockers were active through all categories.

Market trends varied through the young cattle. Vealer steers returning to the paddock remained close to firm, however there was a quality related price change. There were no heifers from the previous sale to make a comparison. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to cheaper trends, the medium and heavy feeders were affected by the reduced competition, while the continued dry weather and the opportunity to buy younger steers affected the light weights. There were cheaper trends also through the yearling heifers, however the feeders held up reasonably well.

Heavy grown steers sold to dearer trends with some returning to the paddock. There was improvement by as much 20c/kg with increased competition. Well finished grown heifers also sold to dearer trends, while feeders with 2 or more teeth experienced strong gains. With the full complement of processors back in the market for cows, that trend was also dearer than the previous sale. Heavy bulls were as much as 10c/kg dearer."
"There was a small reduction in numbers despite this being the last sale for a couple of weeks due to the Easter break. The offering consisted a good supply of vealers and cows, while yearlings were also well supplied. The quality of the offering was fair to good. Condition was also mixed. Most regular processors and feedlots operated and there was good restocker competition.

The extra restocker activity saw vealers returning to the paddock sell to a dearer trend with the steer portion improving by 1c to 3c/kg. Light weight heifers averaged 11c to 18c/kg while medium weights experienced little but quality related price change. Yearlings to feed saw a firm to slightly dearer market trend, while secondary quality yearlings attracted strong competition to average 9c to 17c/kg dearer.

Grown steers to feed remained firm, with a drop in quality affecting average prices. There were too few heavy grown steers to process for a quote. Cows sold to a cheaper trend to average 1c to 5c/kg cheaper."
"There was a small mixed quality offering to commence sales for the New Year. Yearling heifers dominated supply, with a small number of yearling steers. There were no heavy steers, while cow numbers were fair. The regular processors were in attendance.

The young cattle market showed variable trends. There were insufficient yearling steers to quote a trend. Lightweight yearling heifers both trade and to restockers sold to a dearer trend, up 4c/kg on pre Christmas levels. The 3 score heifers to the trade sold to a slightly cheaper trend, however this was most likely due to the small numbers available and the strength of feeder orders. The well finished heifers sold to feeders sold at dearer rates, with heavy weights up to 7c/kg dearer.

The cow market started the New Year on a bright note with the market firm to 6c/kg dearer. A fair penning of bulls attracted spirited bidding with a dearer market trend the result."
"There was a small increase in the overall numbers. Young cattle were well supplied. There were some outstanding heavy weight grown steers along with a fair supply of grown heifers. Cows were also well supplied. The quality and condition of the offering was generally good with very few plain cattle penned. There was increased restocker and feedlot competition however not all the export processors returned this sale.

Restocker demand was strong on vealer steers with market trends dearer. There was some negative price change brought about by the increased supply impacting average quality. The heifer portion sold to a cheaper trend. Again quality and breed vareiation impacted price change in the medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed. Market trends, however were firm to dearer. There were strong gains in the medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to restock and feed with the increased competition.

Heavy grown steers to feed sold to dearer trends. The well finished heavy steers and bullocks saw little but quality and weight related price change. The reduced processor competition impacted the grown heifer and cow markets. Restocker cows experienced little change however the well finished cows to process saw trends much cheaper. That trend carried into the bull market with heavy weights to process significantly cheaper.

Market reporter; James Armitage."
"There was a small increase in the overall numbers. A large percentage were cows while the other categories had a fair representation. Overall the quality and condition of the offering was good. There was a greater supply of heavy weight cattle. Buyer participation increased in the feeders and cattle to process. 

Market trends varied through the young cattle. The vealer steers to restockers showed little but quality and breed related price change. The increased competition impacted on yearling cattle with the medium and heavy weight feeder steers showing a significantly dearer market trend. Those trends followed through to the yearling heifers to feed. Well finished heavy weights to the trade also posted strong gains. 

Heavy weight grown steers to feed sold on a firm to slightly cheaper market trend with breed having some impact on price change. A very good quality penning of well finished grown heifers posted strong gains on a dearer market trend with increased competition. Well finished medium and heavy weight cows sold to dearer trends under strong competition. The 5 and 6 score cows attracted weaker demand to sell to a cheaper trend. Restockers were active on plainer condition cows and the PTIC lots. The bull market was cheaper with demand weaker.

Market reporter; James Armitage."
"There was a small increase in the numbers with vealers and cows well supplied. There was a reduced penning of yearlings. The quality and condition of the offering was fair to good. The recent processor orders were in attendance along with extra feedlot and restocker competition.

Restocker demand was much weaker on the vealer steers, despite some very good quality pens available. With the exception of a small number of very light weight steers, market trends were substantially cheaper. Conversely the heavier weight classes of heifer vealers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend with breed and quality contributing. Medium weight yearling steers in limited supply sold to cheaper trends regardless of the extra competition. The heavy weight feeder steers saw a firm to cheaper trend, with odd pens of highly sought breeds holding their value. Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to significantly cheaper trends with an odd exception.

Heavy grown steers and bullocks to process saw a firm to dearer trend with both weight and quality accounting for some price change. The cow market saw cheaper trends with the medium weight cows showing the greatest falls. Restockers were active on a line of PTIC cows with prices well above those going to processors. Cheaper trends in the bull market.

Market Reporter, James Armitage."
"There was a small increase in supply. Cows and vealers made up a large percentage of the offering. There was a fair supply of yearlings. The quality of the vealers was primarily good, but very mixed through the yearlings. Large numbers of cows were at the lower end of the condition spectrum. The usual processor and feedlot orders were in place, while there was a noticeable presence of southern restocker orders.

Market trends varied through the young cattle. Light weight steer vealers to restockers sold to a dearer trend, up to 10c/kg, along with some quality related improvement. The medium weights sold to a cheaper trend of as much as 23c/kg. Heifer vealers to restockers attracted increased demand and competition, recording dearer trends of as much as 15c to 20c/kg. Increased competition saw the yearling steers in all weight classes sell to a slightly dearer trend, with quality related price change. Yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends, with the light weights most affected. The well bred lines suitable to feed were least affected, easing 6c to 8c/kg.

Too few heavy grown steers or well finished heifers to quote. Despite the large numbers, the light and medium weight cows experienced little, but quality related price change. There was good restocker competition to underpin the market. Well finished cows sold to a dearer trend of as much as 12c/kg."

"There was a small increase in supply with lightweight yearlings in large numbers. There was a fair supply of cows and bulls however not many other grown cattle. The quality of the offering was fair to good with some large lines of lightweight yearling heifers. Apart form cows the majority of the young cattle were on the plainer end of the condition scores. There was reduced buyer attendance both restockers and processors.

Demand for young cattle was down resulting in cheaper trends throughout. Restockers were active through the lightweight young cattle attracted by the lower prices while there was not a great selection of yearlings suitable to feed. The fortnight between sales contributed to some significant price change on a falling market. A large run of lightweight yearling heifers in store condition sold well in comparison to the heavier weights. 

There were insufficient heavy grown steers to quote. Well finished grown heifers to process sold to cheaper trends. Plain condition cows were least affected in a cheaper cow market that saw the well finished cows lose all of the last sales improvement with trends cheaper by 10c/kg. Heavy bulls also sold to cheaper trends with limited processor competition."
"There was a small increase in supply in what was a very mixed quality penning. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering along with the usual large offering of bulls.

Medium and heavy weights in limited supply sold to cheaper trends.
With the reduced processor competition market trends through the grown steers and heifers were cheaper for the most part. There were breed and quality related price changes in some to restock and feed. The well finished cows sold to cheaper trends while the plainer conditioned cows saw a slightly dearer trend when attracting restocker activity. Heavy bulls sold to cheaper trends."
"There was a small increase in supply as producers continue to offload in the face of poor seasonal conditions . The quality of the offering was very mixed with young cattle making up a large percentage. The condition of the offering varied greatly with large numbers on the plainer side. Conversely there were some very well finished grown cattle . The usual processors were in attendance along with some feedlot participation. A rain forecast saw restocker activity high.

The forecast increased demand for the young cattle and resulted in dearer trends through most classes. The majority posted strong gains. The lightly muscled yearling heifers in the light weight classes saw a breed related price change in the negative.

The quality and condition of the grown steers was generally plain with several pens of plain condition full mouth manufacturing steers penned. The majority were purchased by restockers and opportunity feedlotters. The few  well finished lots purchased by processors were a little dearer as were the well finished grown heifers. Quality contributed also. There were cheaper trends for the most part through the cow market with most showing slight falls. The best of the heavy weight cows were slightly dearer with some improved quality. A larger supply of bulls sold to cheaper trends."

The quality of the offering was mixed with some plainer quality lots alongside quite a few well breed high quality pens. Not all the usual processors were in attendance, however the return of another covered that absence.

Demand was high throughout with both restocker and feedlotters competing strongly. Light weight young cattle were keenly sought with very light weights reaching levels not seen before.

The quality of the offering was quite mixed, with condition fair to very good. There was an increased percentage of cattle in the medium and heavy weight classes.

There were varying trends in the young cattle. Restocker steer vealers sold to cheaper trends. The better quality medium and heavy weight feeder steers sold to a slightly dearer market trend, while the lessor quality lines met weaker demand to sell to cheaper trends. The cheaper trends carried through to the heifer yearlings to feed, breed and quality variations also contributed to the lower prices.

Grown steers to feed sold to a cheaper trend with a wide variation in age, breed and quality.

Demand from restockers waned somewhat over the fortnight. This resulted in cheaper trends for both steers and heifers. There was some significant price reduction. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers were in good numbers with quality showing improvement. The market trend for medium weight was generally firm, while the improved nature of the heavy feeders contributed to some strong price gains. Yearling heifers to restock and feed also saw a firm to dearer market trend.

A good quality offering of medium weight restocker steers sold to a dearer trend. Heavy feeder steers sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c/kg. Yearling heifers to restockers averaged cheaper however this was directly related to a substantial increase in weight, once again the trend was firm. The well finished trade heifers sold firm.

There was a good quality offering of heavy grown steers. There was also an improved quality penning of cows with this contributing to increase prices. Restockers were active on the plainer condition cows at firm to dearer rates with this flowing onto the plain cows to processors."
"There was a small increase in numbers. Plain quality light weight young cattle were well represented. The overall quality and condition of the offering was quite plain with only a few pens of well finished good quality cattle available. The usual processors were in attendance and there was extra feedlot competition.

Restocker demand for light weight young cattle representing lower $ per head values was very high. Comparing the market trend to the previous sale 2 weeks ago those light weight young cattle to restockers were cheaper, however the plain quality nature of those available should be taken into account. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed remained firm with breed related improvement in the heavy weights.

"There was a small increase in numbers. All categories represented in what was a mostly plain quality penning. There were some very good cows and a small number of well bred vealers and yearlings. The usual processors were in attendance along with an increased presence of restocker buyers. Demand was high throughout as restockers look to put something into paddocks to eat what looks to be an abundance of feed.

The high demand resulted in dearer trends for the most part through the young cattle. The variations in quality accounted for some large price changes, both positive and negative. Vealer steers to restock saw a firm to dearer market trend with large variations in quality. Light weight vealer heifers to restocks sold to a significantly dearer trend. Yearling steers under 330kg experienced significant price improvement with some of the very plain light weights attracted prices similar to those of the vealers.

Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed were up to 15c/kg cheaper with significant price reductions for heavy feeders. Yearling heifers struggled due to a lack of demand and the reduced competition to show significantly cheaper market trends. 

There were insufficient well-finished heavy grown steers for a market comparison. Three score grown heifers were up to 20c/kg cheaper in places. Plain conditioned cows attracted increased competition with a single lot feeder active and as a result, they experienced little change. Three and four score cows met weaker demand and sold up to 13c/kg cheaper."
"There was a small increase in numbers, with the overall quality of the offering very mixed. All categories were represented. There were some well finished yearlings, heavy steers and cows as well as a large percentage of secondary quality light weight yearlings.

Market trends varied through the young cattle, with light weight yearling steers to restockers selling to a dearer trend. There was no feeder steer comparison from the previous market.

"There was a small increase in numbers, with the condition of the yarding primarily plain. There were a few well finished cows and a very small number of well finished yearlings. The usual buyers attended.

Quality contributed to some quite large price variations through the young cattle. This was particularly noticeable in the vealer steers to restockers. Restockers were keen to purchase light weight vealer heifers, resulting in dearer trends. The heifer vealers suitable to the trade sold to a dearer trend, up to 12c/kg, with some quality related price change also. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw a similar story where quality was a factor in cheaper prices. The good quality feeder steers were least affected, with the best remaining firm.

"There was a small increase in numbers with young cattle making up the bulk. There were a few heavy grown steers and heifers alongside some well finished heavy weight cows. Once again there was a good percentage of bulls. The overall quality and condition was very mixed. The usual buyers were in attendance with a bit more export processor competition.

Demand was generally weaker for young cattle, in line with other centres, however some of the better quality yearling steers to restock and feed remained firm. The balance of the steers sold to a cheaper trend with variations in both breed and quality accounting for the great range in price. The yearling heifers also sold to a cheaper trend, up to 15c/kg in line with other centres selling on a weekly basis.

There were a few good quality heavy grown steers penned that sold to feedlotters at dearer prices. The cow market was cheaper by 5c/kg on the best of the heavy weights with quality accounting for greater decreases in averages."
"There was a small increase in numbers with yearlings well supplied. All categories, other than heavy grown steers, had fair representation.

The full field of export processors were in attendance and there were similar number of feedlotters, albeit some different orders.

Trends varied through the young cattle with vealers to restock mostly cheaper. Medium weight steers and heifers remained close to firm and there was some quality related price change. There was not the spirited competition for medium and heavy feeder steers, however demand was still high. Market trends were cheaper, averaging 6c on medium weights and up to 10c/kg on the heavy weights. There was increased restocker activity through all weight ranges with lightweights in particular selling to a dearer trend. Lightweight heifers sold to a cheaper trend. Medium and heavy yearling heifers to feed sold to a dearer trend with those destined for the short-fed market showing the strongest gains. There was also a lift in quality in the heavyweights.

Vealers to the trade sold to a cheaper trend, down 1c to 3c/kg. A smaller field of restocker buyers saw the yearling steers sell to a cheaper trend with values easing by 3c to 19c/kg. A drop in quality contributed to most of the fall. Heavy yearling steers to feed sold close to firm. There was a good supply of heifer yearlings suitable to restockers and feeders, the best quality heifers sold slightly dearer with the balance holding firm. Trade yearling heifers remained firm.

There was a very mixed quality offering of grown steers with a limited supply good enough to kill.

The better quality grown heifers showing permanent teeth sold firm with the plainer quality selling to a cheaper trend. There was little change in the cow market."
"There was a small increase in numbers with the overall quality of the offering very mixed. Plain condition light and medium weight yearlings made up the bulk of the offering. There were a few well finished grown cattle while medium weight cows were well supplied. The usual processors were in attendance less a bull buyer. There was increased restocker activity.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with yearling steers selling to cheaper trends. There were some substantial price changes recorded. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers sold on a firm to slightly dearer trend under strong local and southern competition. The medium and heavy weight feeder heifers sold to a significantly cheaper trend.

No market comparison for the well finished heavy grown steers to process. Grown heifers to feed sold to cheaper trends while the well finished lines were well received by processors. Breed and age was a factor in the considerable price increase for medium weight cows to restockers. The limited supply of well finished cows sold to a dearer trend of 10c/kg. The reduced competition in the heavy bull market resulted in a significantly cheaper trend."
"There was a small increase in numbers with all categories represented. The overall quality of the offering was quite mixed and well finished young cattle were in limited numbers. Lines of weaners were scarce as the main selling season winds down. The usual processors operated however feedlot competition was reduced. Restockers also showed more restraint with the first frost due soon. Overall demand was weaker.

Market trends were generally cheaper through the young cattle with the medium and heavy weaner steers 8c to 20c/kg cheaper. Average price changes were affected by quality variations. Heifer weaners also sold to a cheaper trend for the most part; however there were odd sales of better quality heifers lines that were dearer. The medium and heavy yearling steers took the biggest hit with the reduced competition, easing by 30c to 40c/kg. Heifer yearlings to restockers and feed saw a firm market on the light weights and a cheaper market trend for the medium and heavy weights.

A quality improvement saw price increases for heavy grown steers to processors while the grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend. The well finished cows to processors sold to a cheaper trend of 12c to 20c/kg as supply concerns ease. The plainer condition cows attracted restocker competition and were the least affected, while a reduction in quality affected prices for store cows to restockers."
"There was a small increase in numbers with all categories represented. Quality was quite mixed, and there was a large variation in weight and condition. There was a good supply of well-bred weaners and some very well finished heavy grown steers and bullocks. Cows were well supplied, while there was a large drop-off in numbers and quality in grown heifers. The usual buyers were in attendance, with demand varied throughout.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with isolated exceptional sales from local restockers. Weaner steers over 200kg saw a large increase in the top sales, however overall averaged 3c/kg cheaper. The corresponding weight range in the heifer portion sold to a dearer trend, while light weights were as much as 10c/kg cheaper. Light weight yearling steers to restockers sold to dearer trends with an improvement in quality. Medium and heavy weights sold to cheaper trends with an isolated sale dearer to a restocker. There were cheaper trends though all classes of yearling heifers.

Heavy grown steers and bullocks to process sold to cheaper trends, while heavy feeders were up to 5c/kg dearer. Quality and numbers were well down in grown heifers with this a factor in cheaper prices. The cow market saw cheaper trends of 5c to 13c /kg, with well-finished heavy weights least affected. The best heavy bull remained firm."
"There was a small increase in numbers with a good supply of vealers. Cows were in large numbers and there were a few very well finished heavy steers. The overall quality of the offering was fair to good and there were some well finished crop and grass fattened lots available. There was a full field of processors in attendance with all the regulars plus one operating, mostly on grown cattle.

The young cattle market was strong for steers but cheaper for the heifers. Steer vealers to restock sold mostly firm. The heifer vealers to both the trade and restockers sold cheaper, down 5c to 8c/kg. The quality of the light and medium weight yearling steers to restock was not as good as the previous sale, with this impacting on prices. A good quality offering of heavyweight yearlings steers sold to restockers at dearer rates, up 5c to 9c/kg. Heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 5c/kg.

A much improved quality offering of heavy steers sold at dearer rates, with the improvement in prices in line with quality. The increased competition contributed to the cow market regaining the previous sales losses to finish 4c to 12c/kg dearer. Restockers were well catered for with a good supply of plainer condition cows, both joined and unjoined. The bull market also benefited from the increased competition to be 16c/kg dearer."
"There was a small increase in numbers with 870 head penned. Young cattle well supplied along with greater numbers of well finished heavy grown cattle. Cows and bulls also well represented. Quality and condition was fair to good through all categories. The regular buyers were in attendance some armed with extra orders.

Quality variations accounted for the cheaper prices obtained for vealer steers to restockers. Demand for the better quality steers remained keen. The heifer portion followed a similar trend. Increased competition saw the medium weight yearling steers sell to a slightly dearer trend. Heavy feeders sold to a slightly cheaper trend with breed weight and quality contributing. There were cheaper trends through most classes of yearling heifers and significantly so in places through the light and medium weights. There was an odd dearer sale in the heavy weights.

Heavy grown steers to feed in excess of 500kg sold to dearer trends. An increased supply of well finished steers to processors also saw some improvement.
There was strong demand for grown heifers with increased feedlot competition also. This resulted in dearer trends throughout with both restockers and feedlots competing strongly with processors. The cow market saw a slightly cheaper trend with some price reduction related to quality. Bulls were significantly cheaper."
"There was a small increase in numbers with 595 head on offer. A good supply of well finished heavy weight cows along with a very mixed quality offering through most categories. The regular processors were in attendance along with strong support from restockers and feedlotters.

An increased penning of vealers suitable to restockers sold to dearer trends with light and medium weight steers showing significant improvements. Breed was a contributing factor in cheaper prices for the heavier weights. The heifer portion also attracted strong competition. There was little but quality related price change in the medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed. Limited supplies of yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends. 

Heavy grown steers to process in limited supply sold to a dearer trend. Well finished heavy weight grown heifers to process also sold to a dearer trend with some strong gains recorded. Well finished heavy weight cows sold on a firm to slightly dearer trend. Those carrying an excess of condition were a little cheaper."
"There was a small increase in numbers with 545 head penned. The quality and condition of the offering was mixed with some well bred young cattle and some very good cows a standout. The usual buyers were in attendance with some represented by different personnel.

Local restocker demand was high on the light and medium weight young cattle. Trends however were cheaper throughout. The vealer steers were as much as 22c/kg cheaper with the heifer portion showing greater falls. There were significantly cheaper trends on the lightweight yearling steers to restock with some of that quality and breed related. The medium weights suffered only slightly. Heavyweight yearling steers saw a cheaper trend of 10c to 40c/ kg on the back of limited buyer competition. Yearling heifers in all classes met weaker competition to show significant losses.

Heavy grown steers and heifers attracted limited processor competition to sell to cheaper trends. The cow market was strong with trends firm to slightly dearer. That was also the case in the heavyweight bulls."
"There was a small increase in numbers comprising a good supply of yearlings, along with a few vealers. There were not many heavy grown steers with cows, heifers and bulls in fair numbers. The quality and condition of the young cattle was quite mixed with a few lines of very well bred cattle standing out. Processor competition was restricted with operations winding down into the Christmas break for a few plants. Restocker activity was again strong.

Market trends varied through the young cattle where quality was also a factor in price change. Vealer steers to restock sold to a much cheaper trend with quality and lot size a contributing factor. The trend for the heifer portion was similar, while those to process were a little dearer. Lightweight yearling steers to restockers were firm to dearer with some quality related price change. Medium and heavy yearling steers to feed remained firm with quality the only factor in price change. Yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend with reduced competition. The better quality heifers were least affected.

Grown heifers with only 2 teeth and suitable to feed sold to a dearer trend, up to 20c/kg with an improvement in quality also. Well finished heifers to process sold to a slightly cheaper trend. There was good demand for plain condition cows from restockers, while processor activity was somewhat subdued on the better 3 and 4 score cows. The market for cows to process was 14c to 20c/kg cheaper with cows to restockers less affected. A large penning of bulls was also much cheaper."
"There was a small increase in numbers as more vendors took advantage of the high prices. There was a limited supply of vealers, however yearlings and grown cattle were in good numbers. The quality of the offering was fair to good while condition was quite mixed. Not all export processors operated and there was a reduction in feedlot activity. Market trends varied and there were various factors contributing to price changes.

Breed and quality contributed to the cheaper prices seen for light weight vealers to restock, both the steers and heifers, with the overall market trend firm to cheaper. Vealer heifers suitable to process sold to a dearer trend, up 3c/kg. Light weight yearling steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, with quality and lot size having a negative effect on prices. Demand for medium and heavy yearling steers to feed remained high, with the market trend up to 5c/kg dearer. There were some large price increases seen in the light weight yearling heifers to restock, with much of the rise attributed to weight and breed. The availability of straight lines in good numbers also contributed. The medium weight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold on a firm to slightly dearer market trend. There were some very well finished medium and heavy yearlings suitable to the trade penned and they sold to a dearer trend.

The well finished heavy grown steers included some milk and 2 tooth lots with this contributing to a dearer market trend of 5c to 7c/kg. Well finished grown heifers also sold to a dearer trend with premiums for 2 tooth lots suitable to domestic trade orders. Heavy cows sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 6c/kg with reduced processor competition. Quality variations were a factor in other price changes in medium weights."
"There was a small increase in numbers after the week off. The offering consisted of a large number of vealer steers, while all other categories were represented. Quality was fair to good, while condition varied. The majority of the well finished cattle were female with the odd better finished steer lots. A full complement of processors were in attendance, along with quite a few restocker orders looking to purchase at the lower market level.

Good quality lines of steer vealers held up reasonably well in comparison to recent levels, however secondary quality lines were cheaper. Vealer heifers were also cheaper with the better quality lines attracting the higher prices. Better quality lots of yearling steers to restock and feed held prices reasonably well, while the plainer quality cattle struggled for a lack of interest. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend, while there was a processor premium for the well finished lots.

There were age and quality variations in the heavy grown steers with the well finished younger steers remaining firm. The older steers not quite finished sold to a cheaper trend. With restockers entering the market for plainer condition cows. prices were reasonably good in comparison to what has been seen this week. This was also the case for the better condition cows to process."
"There was a small drop in numbers, with the quality and condition fairly mixed. Prime young cattle were in limited numbers with the majority suited to the restockers and feedlotters. All grades were once again represented with heavy steers and cows in lower numbers. All regular processors and feedlot orders were in place and operating. Restocker orders were also plentiful.

There was some variation in the young cattle market. Vealer steers, most to restockers sold generally firm although there were a couple of extraordinary sales, much dearer than we have seen for several weeks. Heifer vealers sold to a cheaper trend, down 2c to 6c/kg. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed were firm to slightly cheaper, down 2c/kg. The heavy yearling steers to feedlot orders sold firm. Heifer yearlings to all destinations sold to a cheaper trend, down 1c to 8c/kg.

The grown cattle market saw a cheaper trend through all grades. Heavy steers lost 12 to 14c/kg although overall the average quality was not quite as good. Grown heifers also sold to reduced levels. The cow market sold to a cheaper trend, down 1c to 5c/kg and more in places with restockers active on some of the better frame plain condition cows. Heavy bulls were firm to cheaper."
"There was a small decrease in numbers this week. Yearlings and cows made up the bulk of the offering. There was a fair supply of young calves, taken off cows due to the seasonal conditions. The quality of the offering showed great variation, as did the condition. Despite the poor season there were some well finished cattle presented. There was increased buyer competition, both from restockers and processors.

The better calves attracted strong competition when sold on a live weight basis. The very light weight calves sold on a $/head basis, made as little as $16/head. Vealers to restockers saw a market trend that was firm on the previous sale. Light weight yearling steers to restockers sold to cheaper trends with most falling into the plain quality and condition category. The limited supply of medium weights remained firm. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers also sold to cheaper trends, despite the extra competition. Again, both quality and condition was generally plain. The few well finished medium and heavy weight heifers attracted strong processor demand.

There were insufficient grown steers or well finished grown heifers to quote. Plain quality and condition grown heifers attracted restocker interest. Breed and quality accounted for a large variation in price, with the younger and larger framed heifers attracting strong premiums over the smaller and older lots. There was a good supply of light and medium weight cows at the lower end of condition scores. The plainest cows remained firm. Some of the better 2 score cows sold on a firm to dearer trend. Well finished cows remained firm. A very strong bull market saw heavy weights sell to a dearer trend with increased processor competition."
"There was a small decrease in numbers as the sell off period winds down. There was a good selection of vealers, however, the condition and freshness has deteriorated. Yearling steers and cows were also in fair numbers and there was an increased number of heavy steers penned. All regular processors were in attendance, however, restocker competition for yearling steers decreased.

Demand for vealer steers returning to the paddock was down, resulting in a cheaper trend. Prices were down 7c to 15c/kg. Heifer vealers also sold to a cheaper trend, down 11c to 13c/kg, with light weights showing a bigger fall. Yearling steers to restock in the light and medium weight classes improved in quality, however, the drop in competition saw a cheaper market, down 10c to 15c/kg. Well finished yearling steers to the trade sold to a dearer trend backed up by the improved quality. Heifer yearlings sold at dearer rates, up 4c to 6c/kg.

No quote on heavy grown steers due to the lack of a suitable comparison from last week. It was a strong cow market on a much improved quality offering with a greater selection of high yielding cows on offer. The market trend was firm to 4c/kg dearer. Restocker cows experienced little change, with only quality variations causes prices to differ."
"There was a small decrease in numbers after 2 to 3 inches of rain late last week. Once again young cattle made up the bulk of the offering and there were approximately 250 cows offered. All regular buyers were in attendance although not all operated to recent levels. The quality of the offering was fair to good and there was a fair supply of well finished cattle available.

The market for the majority of the young cattle was good with all grades evident. The light and medium weight vealer steers to restock sold firm while the heavyweights were slightly cheaper due to a slip in quality. Vealer heifers both to the trade and to restockers sold firm to dearer, up 4c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed were well supported to top at 191c with lightweights to restockers selling 12c/kg dearer. The medium and heavyweight steers to restock and feed sold mostly firm with odd sales dearer at 175c/kg. The medium and lightweight heifer yearlings to the trade sold firm while heavyweights were slightly cheaper. Yearling heifers to restock and feed remained firm with isolated sales showing a dearer trend.

There was little movement in the market for grown cattle. Heavyweights ranged from 147c to 156c while bullocks averaged 158c/kg. Grown heifers held firm with sales to 149c/kg. The cow market also held firm with an odd pen slightly cheaper. Medium weight D3â€™s eased 4c to average 113c while well finished heavyweights averaged 128c with sales to 131c/kg."
"There was a small decline in numbers this week, with young cattle making up the bulk of the offering and a large penning of steer vealers also present. Grown cattle were well supplied with an increased penning of well finished heavy grown steers. The overall quality of the offering was improved with more fresh and finished lines available. All but one of the regular processors were in attendance with the sheer weight of numbers putting kill space at a premium. Restocker activity was there at a reduced level, with both prices and enthusiasm diminished.

Cheaper trends were the norm through the young cattle. Steer vealers to restock sold to a cheaper trend with the medium to heavyweight classes 9c to 13c/kg cheaper. There was a little more activity on lightweights that saw them record a dearer trend. Heifer vealers also sold to a cheaper trend with limited demand from both processors and restockers, down 11c to 15c. Yearling steers to restock and feed attracted little interest, to record some large price falls. Good quality yearling heifers showing finish sold firm to slightly dearer to the trade, whilst heifers to restock were cheaper.

The quality and finish of the heavy grown steers improved, however there were still age related price variations evident. The best of the milk and 2 tooth steers over 500kg remained firm, while the older 4 and 6 tooth steers were cheaper. The cow market was cheaper throughout, with the better finished medium and heavyweights down 9c and the plainer condition cows back 18c and more in places."
"There was a slightly smaller offering of fair quality cattle that for the most part presented in plain condition. There were a few fresher cattle off crops, but few well finished lots. The low numbers saw a small number of processors in attendance however restocker demand was high.

The young cattle market saw restocker compete strongly for light weight steers, with both vealers and yearlings selling to a dearer trend, up to 8c/kg dearer. Medium weight yearling steers followed a similar trend. Heifer yearlings to restock sold to a cheaper trend with average prices well down. Quality was a contributing factor.

There were no heavy steers last week to make a market comparison to, while the cow market realised a cheaper trend."
"There was a slightly smaller offering as vealer numbers reduce. The quality of the offering was fair to good although there were less well finished cattle seen at previous sales. There was a good selection of young cattle and cows, while heavyweight steers were in limited supply. All regular buyers were in attendance. 

The market for young cattle showed some variation. Vealer steers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend, down 2c to 8c/kg. Restocker activity was slightly weaker on vealer heifers saw them also sell to a cheaper trend, down 6c/kg on average. There was strong competition on heifer vealers from the usual processor and butcher orders, with the market for these heifers showing a dearer trend, up 2c to 8c/kg. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold to a dearer trend, particularly the light and medium weights, up 4c to 9c/kg. There was a much smaller offering of heifer yearlings with heifers to the trade selling to a dearer trend, from firm to 5c/kg dearer.

The limited supply of heavyweight steers sold to a dearer trend, up by 7c/kg due to the younger average age of the steers. There were some good quality well finished grown heifers penned with the market showing a dearer trend. The offering of cows showed great variation in quality and condition. Plain condition cows to the restockers and processors sold firm to slightly dearer under increased restocker competition. The 3 and 4 score cows to processors experienced little change; however a few of the best cows were 2c to 3c/kg dearer."
"There was a slightly reduced penning brought about by forecasts of significant rainfall. Half of the offering was made up by cows, with bulls providing a further 10%. The condition was mostly plain with a few better pens throughout. The usual processors were in attendance. Restockers showing great resilience were extremely active.

Light weight young cattle to restockers sold to dearer trends with calves and light weight vealer steers improving by in excess of 100c/kg. Yearling steers to restockers experienced significantly dearer trends with some improvement in quality. Those dearer trends also carried into the heifer yearlings.

Lightly muscled grown heifers attracted strong demand from restockers with breed and age related price variation. There were dearer trends through the cow market with restockers and a feedlot order competing strongly. The 1 and 2 score cows attracted strong gains. Increased demand from processors saw the limited supply of well finished cows sell to a dearer trend of 10c/kg. Heavy bulls saw price improvements of between 30c and 50c/kg with some quality improvement and a larger processor presence."
"There was a slightly heavier yarding of 1,000 head of cattle an increase of 70 compared to last weeks sale. Light veal were in fair numbers as were yearling steers and heifers.  There was a heavier yarding of heavy steers and bullocks and a fair supply of cows.

Quality was mixed although there were some well finished cattle through the sale.   The market for young cattle eased slightly which has been the trend in most centers this week.  Yearling steers met strong competition from feeders and restockers with fewer steers going to the feeders this week.  Yearling heifers sold mainly unchanged with fewer light plainer types in the yarding.

The good run of heavy steers and bullocks sold to a dearer trend.  The cow market was strong for the heavier weights however some of the medium cows were a little easier.  Restocker demand continued to be strong on the light plain cows.  Heavy bulls sold on a cheaper market although quality was not as good."
"There was a slight reduction in numbers. All grades were represented in a fair to good quality offering. The regular buyers were in attendance for a market of variable trends, for the most part firm to cheaper.

The very light weight vealers steers to restockers sold quite a bit cheaper, related to breed quality. The medium weights were 2c to 10c/kg cheaper. The heavyweights were in demand and remained firm. Heifer vealers to processors sold to a cheaper trend, of 5c to 7c/kg, while those to restockers were firm with quality related price variations. The 3 score vealers sold firm to cheaper with the best least affected by the falling prices. Medium weight yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend with an improvement in average quality. There was a large offering of heifer yearlings with some good support from restockers, both to finish and join. The better quality cattle from a breed perspective were firm to slightly dearer with the balance firm.

Heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend of 5c to 7c/kg with a drop in average quality on the heaviest weight class. The cow market followed a similar trend with the fall in prices the same as that of the grown steers."
"There was a slight reduction in numbers with yearling steers and heifers well supplied. Grown steers were scarce with only a small number of cows. The regular processors were in attendance along with a large contingent of restocker buyers. The overall quality of the cattle was good; however the condition of the young cattle was more suited to the restockers. Some well finished heavy steers and cows were penned.

The market for yearling steers to restock remained firm for the lightweight categories. Substantial gains were made in the medium weight classes with the quality of those penned showing vast improvement. Yearling heifers sold firm to 6c/kg dearer with this trend carrying through those to processors and restockers.

The small number of heavy steers remained firm. Heavy cows sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 6c/kg."
"There was a slight increase in numbers with the rise shown in grown steers and vealers. The increase in calves and vealers was brought about by producers opting to wean early, in an effort to give their cows a better chance. All other grades were represented in a market that saw values ease in most cases.

Demand for young cattle was much weaker with calves to processors selling up to 27c/kg cheaper. The light and medium weight vealers sold 5c to 28c/kg cheaper, with odd sales of the freshest veal showing a smaller fall. Restocker demand for lightweight yearling steers was a lot less with the market falling by 16c to 20c/kg and more on the plainer quality lots. The medium and heavyweight yearling steers to restock and feed were less affected with values firm to 9c/kg cheaper. Lightweight heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend down 2c to 6c/kg on the better quality lines, while the plainer grades were as much as 13c/kg cheaper. The 3 scores to the trade also sold to a cheaper trend. 

The grown steer offering saw quality and condition very mixed. There were increased numbers of well finished heavyweights, most carrying 4 to 8 teeth. The market for these was 3c to 5c/kg cheaper. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 12c/kg. There was some feedlot competition on heifers with 2 or more teeth. The cow market was variable with cows to restock selling dearer. The balance of the cows with the exception of an odd pen of heavyweight, high yielding cows sold 3c to 5c/kg cheaper."
"There was a slight increase in numbers with quality mixed. Lightweight yearlings and cows made up the bulk of the offering, however all categories were represented. These sold to a similar gallery of buyers to the previous sale.

The market trends for young cattle were mostly cheaper with quality variations also playing a part in price changes. Lightweight yearling steers to restock averaged 3c/kg cheaper. Lightweight heifer yearlings also sold to a cheaper trend, with prices down 12c to 16c/kg with quality contributing to those price changes. Isolated well finished heifers to the trade were firm to dearer.

A small number of heavy grown steers sold dearer for quality. Cows to restockers remained firm, while those to process were firm to 5c/kg cheaper."
"There was a slight improvement in numbers with 685 head offered. Limited numbers of cows and grown steers were yarded. Weaner and yearling steers were in good supply, but there were reduced numbers in other classes. Restockers and feeders were active, with one processor out of the market .

Weaner steers were dearer, as were yearling steers and heifers. Weaner heifers were slightly cheaper. Many of the steers went to feeders or restockers.

Heavy steers were in short supply and sold firm and heavy heifers were cheaper. There werenâ€™t many cows through the offering and these were cheaper. Bulls sold firm on last week's prices."
"There was a similar yarding of cattle to last week, with vealers, yearlings and cows making up the majority. The young cattle offered were of mixed quality. The largest percentage of cattle went to restockers and feeders, with only an odd sale to the trade. 

Competition was stronger, with restocker vealer steers selling 5c to 8c dearer, topping at 325c, while restocker vealer heifers were up by 15c, for a top price of 295c/kg. Trade yearling steers sold to a high of 286c, while restocker and feeder steers were 4c to 8c/kg dearer, with some sales more. Medium weight feeder steers averaged around 300c and restocker steers sold to a top of 332c/kg. Trade yearling heifers topped at 300c, while feeder heifers averaged around 276c/kg.

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of medium and heavy weights, along with an odd pen of grown steers and heifers. Steers sold to a top of 263c and heifers to 261c/kg. Medium and heavy cows were 14c to 16c dearer, with medium weights averaging around 208c and heavy cows sold from 204c to 236c/kg. Restockers were active in the market, paying up to 205c/kg for PTIC cows."
"There was a significant fall in numbers despite the colder months just around the corner. The quality of the offering was very mixed with some good quality restocker and feeder cattle available. The regular buyers were in attendance.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with restocker steer weaners selling on a generally firm trend with some quality related price change. The heifer portion were less keenly sought with a cheaper trend throughout. Yearlings steers were well supported with the light and medium weights firm to slightly dearer. The heavy weight feeders also saw a firm to slightly dearer trend. There were cheaper trends through the yearling heifers with competition not as strong. 

Too few heavy grown steers to quote. The well finished grown heifers to process sold to a dearer trend while those to feed were cheaper. There was a substantial fall in the cow market with processor demand well down. Restockers however were again active in the plainer condition lines. The bull market followed a similar trend."
"There was a sharp rise in numbers with thw majority being vealers. The offering was dominated by vealers, particularly heifers, and yearlings. There was a fair number of cows and a small offering of heavyweight steers. All regular orders were in place with the regular buyers attending.

The quality of the young cattle was equal to last week with lines of good quality heifer vealers available to processors.The market for vealers to processors did not sustain the bouyancy of last week, resulting in a cheaper trend, down 7c to 8c/kg on steers and heifers. Vealer steers to restockers reversed that trend to sell 5c dearer with some good quality light and medium weight lines offered. Yearling steers of fair to good quality also sold to a dearer trend, up 9c/kg and more in places after more rain overnight. Trade yearling heifers sold firm for the best and cheaper on the plain quality grades, while heifer yearlings to restock remained firm. There were some lightweight plain condition heifer yearlings that sold much dearer with the buyers looking more at the dollar per head value.

A mixed quality offering of heavyweight steers sold at unchanged rates with a premium of about 10c/kg for 2 tooth steers. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. The cow market saw the plain condition cows sell to a cheaper trend, with quality a factor. Frame size restricted restocker activity also. The better condition cows to processors remained close to firm."
"There was a sharp reduction in numbers, particularly in the vealers with young cattle and cows making up the bulk of the penning. The quality and condition of the offering was very mixed. A full field of processors were in attendance and demand from restockers and feeder buyers was high for all classes.

Market trends were mostly dearer with the price gap between secondary and good quality cattle closing. Steer vealers to restock were 8c to 12c/kg dearer and more in places with an improvement in the quality of the heavy weights noticeable. There were greater price improvements for the light and medium weight heifer vealers to restock. The heavier weights to feed were cheaper in price for increased weight. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed attracted increased support, selling to a dearer trend of 7c to 13c/kg. The Straight bred Angus steers attracted premiums. There were strong gains in the light weight heifer yearlings to restock and feed, while medium weight feeders improved by 5c/kg.

The limited supply of well finished heavy grown steers and heifers sold to a dearer trend. There were quite a few plain condition cows penned, they sold to a dearer trend and attracted solid restocker competition. The well finished medium and heavy weights were 3c to 5c/kg dearer."
"There was a sharp reduction in numbers, almost half. Yearlings made up the bulk of the penning with limited supplies through the other categories and classes. The quality of the offering was quite mixed, however there were some good lines of young cattle available. There was restricted feedlot and processor competition as a result of the low numbers, however restocker activity remained high.

Most categories in the young cattle recorded cheaper trends as a result of the reduced competition, with breed and quality variations also contributing. The restocker and feeder cattle showed some significant price reductions. The restricted feedlot competition combined with the quality variations a major contributing factor to those price falls. Light weight yearling steers to restock however remained firm.

Grown steers to restock and feed attracted limited demand with the market trend much cheaper. The few heavy grown and manufacturing steers were up to 10c/kg cheaper. Cows ranged from 9c to 17c/kg cheaper, again due mostly to restricted processor competition."
"There was a sharp reduction in numbers in an offering that included a line of 300 store conditioned light weight Angus heifer yearlings. There were less than 150 steer in the penning. The overall quality of the offering was mixed while condition varied greatly. There were some very good cows showing higher yield potential. The usual processors were in attendance however not all got a start. Restockers were plentiful.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with light weight yearling steers to restockers selling to dearer trends. The medium and heavy weights were cheaper with limited competition. Those light weight yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend with breed a major factor in a strong price increase. The heavier weights up to 330 kg also sold to a slightly dearer trend. Medium and heavy weights in limited supply sold to cheaper trends with well finished lots suitable to process struggling under limited competition. 

There were insufficient heavy grown steers to quote. The well finished grown heifers to process sold to cheaper trends while those to restock and feed were dearer. A stronger cow market saw trends dearer throughout with the higher yields contributing to the improvement for heavy weights."
"There was a sharp increase in supply in the 2 weeks since the previous sale. The quality of the offering was fair to very good. There was plenty of weight available with limited supplies of light and medium weight young cattle penned. There was increased processor and feedlot competition along with strong restocker activity on the lighter weight classes. Demand was high throughout. 

Market trends were mostly dearer through the young cattle. There was however little to compare to from the previous sales low numbers in some classes. The increased supplies also brought quality variations into play. Vealer steers to restockers were cheaper, weight increases having an impact. Medium weight yearling steers to feed also averaged cheaper on an otherwise firm market trend. Similar weight steers to restockers saw a dearer trend, up to 8c/kg. A good supply of well finished and high quality heavy feeder steers experienced strong gains. The medium and heavy weight yearling feeder heifers also posted strong improvement. Grown steers to feed up to and over 500kg met keen demand to show a much dearer trend. Grown heifers also dearer. 

There was little change in the market for a very well finished penning of heavy weight cows. There was a large penning of heavy weight bulls with competition from processors strong. Nothing to compare to from the previous sale."
"There was a sharp increase in numbers. Most grades were represented with a greater supply of vealers and heavy steers in particular. Yearlings suitable to restock and feed were well supplied. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market with variable trends.

The trade vealer prices dropped 40c to 55c/kg. The steer vealers were underpinned somewhat by restockers, although they were still quite a bit cheaper though. Light and medium weight yearling steers sold to a cheaper trend of 5c to 8c/kg with most of the fall attributable to quality fluctuations. There were few heavy yearling steers offered. Light weight heifer yearlings suitable to the trade were affected by the drop in vealer values. The heifers suitable to restock remained firm for both light and medium weights. The quality of the medium weights improved as C3 trade heifer yearlings sold 4c/kg dearer.

An increased supply of heavy steers sold to a dearer trend of 6c/kg. The cow market varied a little with the general run of medium and heavy cows firm to slightly cheaper. The heavy cows with high potential yields were firm. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"There was a sharp increase in numbers. Large supplies of cows as producers offload core breeders. There was a good supply of vealers and yearling heifers, along with some very good quality heavy feeder steers. Overall, the quality of the young cattle showed great variation. The usual buyers attended and there was increased restocker activity on the plainer condition cows. Once again, there was a live export order for bulls.

The market trend for steer vealers to restockers was cheaper, with some of the price change quality related. However, the overall trend was as much as 30c/kg cheaper. The heifer vealers to both restock and the trade remained close to firm, again with some variation in quality. Medium weight yearling steers to feed sold to a slightly cheaper trend. A much improved quality penning of heavy yearling feeder steers sold to a dearer trend. Light weight yearling heifers sold to dearer trend. The medium and heavy weights to feed were up to 10c/kg dearer.

The majority of the heavy grown steers went to feed pens, with breed and increased competition accounting for much of the price improvement. With the large number of cows on offer, market trends were cheaper. The well finished cows met weaker demand to show a cheaper trend of 30c/kg and more in places. The increased restocker competition saw the plainer condition cows less affected, some sales remaining firm. The bull market was cheaper for a lessor quality penning."
"There was a sharp increase in numbers, with supplies almost doubling. Vealers and yearlings were well supplied and there was a good selection of grown cattle in all categories. The overall quality and condition of the penning was mixed. Regular orders were in place and there was extra restocker and feeder competition.

The young cattle market recovered all of the previous weekâ€™s losses. Vealer steers to restock sold to a dearer trend, with prices improving by as much as 35c/kg in some cases. Heifer vealers remained firm, although there was a slight drop in average quality causing a fall in average prices. There was a better quality penning of light and medium weight yearling steers, they sold to a dearer trend up to 10c/kg on the lightweights. Medium and heavyweights to restock and feed remained close to firm. There was very good support from all sectors for heifer yearlings with the trend dearer, up 10c to 20c/kg. Breed quality played a part in some prices at the lower end where less desirable breeds were presented.

The grown cattle section of the offering met strong demand from exporters with heavy grown steers dearer, up 10c to 12c/kg. Grown heifers also saw an improved market. Cows were well supported with the market dearer up by 6c to 7c/kg."
"There was a sharp increase in numbers, which is not unusual at this time of the year. All grades were represented although weaners and cows were in greater numbers. All the regular buyers were in attendance and operating on a fair to good quality offering that also included the usual run of lesser quality cattle.

The market for most grades realized a cheaper trend. The exception was the weaner steers to restockers that sold firm to 5c/kg dearer under some very keen restocker activity. Heifer vealers to the trade generally sold cheaper down 15c to 20c/kg although there were odd sales that experienced lesser falls. Heifer weaners to restockers also sold to a cheaper trend, although not as great as those to slaughter, down 2c to 8c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed were 7c to 15c/kg cheaper, with the quality only fair. Trade yearling heifers were down 6c to 15c while heifer yearlings going to the feed pens sold 2c to 8c/kg cheaper.

The best of the heavy steers sold firm, odd sales of the younger bullocks slightly dearer for quality. The plainer grades sold to a cheaper trend. The cow market sold cheaper, down 2c to 5c/kg odd sales slightly more."
"There was a sharp increase in numbers with vealers and cows dominating supply. The quality of the offering was mixed with very good quality lines scattered through the vealers and cows. The regular processors were in place and restocker demand was strong.

Despite the large numbers on offer, steer vealers sold to restockers at dearer prices with the trend up 10c to 12c/kg and more in places. With the exception of a single pen of outstanding 3 scores, heifer vealers to processors and restockers met weaker demand to sell to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 4c/kg. The quality of the yearling steers was a factor in the cheaper prices. There was little change to the market for heifer yearlings that was related to quality variations.

There were few well finished heavy grown steers with the market showing a cheaper trend, down 5c/kg with quality and condition a factor. Overall the quality and condition cows penned improved. The market trend was dearer throughout, up 8c to 10c/kg with quality adding a little more to average price increases. Restockers were active on plainer condition cows with those announced as joined fetching a premium. The bull market was very strong and showed significant improvement."
"There was a sharp increase in numbers with producers taking the option to offload earlier than the normal given the current market levels, despite an abundance of feed across the drawing area. There was a large offering of vealers and yearlings with a fair supply of grown cattle. The increased numbers brought extra competition, mainly in the form of feeder orders. The market was fairly solid despite the numbers.

Vealer heifers to process sold to a cheaper trend, down 6c to 8c/kg. The heifers to restockers sold to a dearer trend with extra competition in the market. Vealer steers to restockers sold at firm rates with some breed quality variation. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold close to firm through all weights and grades. Most of the price change evident was attributable to quality variations. Heifer yearlings attracted increased feeder competition and sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 6c/kg. Most heifers went to restockers with limited numbers bought by processors. Trade heifers remained firm.

Heavyweight steers sold to a firm market trend, while the grown heifers also saw little change.  There was little change in the cow market, with any price fluctuations due to variations in quality."
"There was a sharp increase in numbers as producers took advantage of the high demand for cattle of all descriptions and offloaded. This being the largest offering for several years. There was a large gallery of buyers in attendance including several not seen for sometime. The quality of the offering was generally good while condition varied to suit all buyers from restockers through to export processors.

Buoyed by a good season and the current state of the market restockers were active throughout the young cattle. Weaners returning to the paddock sold to a significantly dearer trend with both the steers and the heifer portions keenly sought. Light and medium weight yearling steers saw some of the greatest improvement with both restockers and feedlots competing fiercely. Strong gains were also experienced in the heavy weight feeders with the majority destined for Northern feedlots. Yearlings heifers in all weight classes posted strong gains however the increases were not as great as those of the steers.

With higher weights in demand the grown steers with 2 or more teeth were keenly sought to produce some of the larger price improvements. Well finished heavy weight steers to the processors sold to dearer trends with strong gains in place. Grown heifers also sold to much dearer trends with some good quality lines suitable to the feedlots and some very well finished lots purchased by processors.the cow market saw some variation with a few to restockers selling to a slightly cheaper trend however quality was a factor. The well finished cows were slightly dearer while those in the 5 score category were substantially dearer. A large offering of bulls were keenly sought by processors to show a firm to dearer trend."
"There was a sharp increase in numbers as producers get back in to the swing. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering with only a small number of grown steers and grown heifers. There was a fair supply of early milk vealers and a large offering of yearlings suitable to restockers. The regular processors were in attendance and there was extra trade and feedlot competition. Restocker activity was once again high.

The young cattle market showed varying trends with lightweight steer vealers to restock selling at much cheaper prices. This however was weight and quality related. Heifer vealers sold to a cheaper trend under a big increase in supply. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed attracted strong competition to sell firm to 8c/kg dearer with an improvement in quality accounting for some price increases. Heavy feeder steers also sold dearer by 2c to 3c/kg. A good supply of lightweight heifer yearlings attracted keen demand from restockers, selling strongly. Medium weights to feed sold to a dearer trend of 6c/kg while there was little but quality related change to the medium and heavy trade heifers.

Heavy grown steers sold cheaper with most of the fall in prices related to age and yield potential. Grown heifers also sold to a cheaper trend. The large offering of cows included a good supply of heavy weights. Yield potential was also improved. The market trend was firm to 3c/kg dearer with quality a contributing factor to the improved prices."
"There was a sharp drop in supply on the back of some very useful storm rain over the past fortnight. It was a very mixed quality penning where condition also varied greatly. There was more processor competition this week however the ranks are still not at capacity. Restocker and feedlot competition was also down.

Lightweight young cattle to restockers saw the steers sell to a dearer trend with some breed and quality related price change. The heifer portion mostly firm with quality also affecting price change. The medium and heavy weights sold on a firm to cheaper trend with the good quality lots least affected.

A very mixed quality penning of grown cattle to suit processors. The well finished heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend under the extra competition. Well finished grown heifers also sold to dearer trends however the plainer quality lots were cheaper. Demand was high in the cow market with processors competing strongly. All classes showing strong gains. Heavy bulls sold on a firm to cheaper trend with quality variations accounting for positive price change."
"There was a remarkable improvement in quality following last weeks very plain yarding. All categories were represented by greater numbers of well finished stock.  For the first time this season  vealer and weaner calves were yarded in some numbers.

All the usual regular buyers attended the sale.

The good rain appears to have created a shortage of cattle in the north with both vealer and yearling heifers showing considerable price improvement averaging 4c/kg.

Yearling and grown steers to restockers and to slaughter sold at firm rates with the only variation being caused by that quality improvement. Enquiry for restocker steers remains at a high level .

The cow market showed considerable strength with numbers of quality cows dropping away in all northern saleyards in recent weeks. Values were consistently dearer in the range of 3c to 6c/kg although the quality rise was responsible for a portion of the improvement."
"There was a remarkable drop in the yarding size following some very effective falls of rain earlier in the week. Over 1000 cows were yarded and of the balance light vealers and yearling cattle were in the greatest numbers. In the cow yarding, manufacturing cows were best represented. There was very few trade weight yearlings available while the bullocks mostly lacked real finish. The usual regular operators were present and they were complemented by an increase in restocker orders.

The trend in the market for steer weaners and light calves and yearling steers was dearer, with restockers driving the increase in price. The heifer light calves and light vealers were only just firm with restocker interest limited. Yearling heifers were sought after by restockers and sold at firm rates.

The bullock pens sold at fully firm rates considering that the yield was not high. The manufacturing cows met a steady demand with some added restocker competition and the prices were firm for most with just an occasional pen marginally dearer. Feeder steer prices showed very little alteration.

The best sale price obtained was 179.6c/kg paid for a single fat bullock."
"There was a reduction in the numbers as sales revert to a weekly basis. The offering was made up of mostly plain quality and condition along with a fair supply of plain grown heifers and a very mixed penning of cows. There were limited numbers of cattle showing a higher degree of finish. Most of the usual export processors were in attendance, while there was strong restocker activity. 

Market trends through the young cattle were generally dearer with restockers attracted by the light weights. There were very few cattle to suit the feedlotters. Light weight yearling steers under 330kg sold to a significantly dearer market trend. There was however a large range in price due to quality and breed. The small number of medium weight steers averaged cheaper for quality on a firm market trend. The light weight yearling heifers were only slightly dearer. Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers suitable to the trade attracted strong competition, however there was little in the way of a market comparison to last week.

Plainer quality D muscle grown heifers attracted strong competition with this resulting in a much dearer market trend. The majority being purchased by restockers and feedlots. Well finished grown heifers to processors sold to a dearer trend. The plainest quality and condition cows sold to cheaper trends. The better medium weight 2 scores remained firm with an odd quality related price improvement. Heavy 3 and 4 score cows saw little change. Heavy bulls sold to cheaper trends with some quality related change."
"There was a reduction in supply. An influx of empty females brought on by the pregnancy testing season being in full swing. The quality of the offering was very mixed with few good lines penned. The condition varied greatly with quite a few of the cows down in condition after having reared calves. There were very few weaners penned with upcoming weaner sales holding them back. The regular processors operated however there was reduced restocker and feedlot competition.

That reduced competition combined with a drop in quality saw the weaner steers to restockers sell to a considerably cheaper trend while the heifer portion suffered greater losses. Light weight yearling steers to restockers followed a similar trend. Medium and heavy weight yearling feeder steers while cheaper were a lot less affected than those to restock. There was a quality related positive price change on medium weight yearling heifers however the market trend was generally cheaper with the secondary quality lots greatly affected. The good quality lots held up reasonably well.

Heavy grown steers to process met with weaker demand to sell to a dearer trend of as much as 17c/kg. Grown heifers also sold to cheaper trends. The cow market was substantially cheaper weaker processor demand and an increased supply. The plainer condition cow market was underpinned somewhat by several restocker orders. Heavy bulls sold to a much cheaper trend. There were not many very good sound bulls penned."
"There was a reduction in supply, not uncommon at this time of the year. A very mixed quality penning was presented to a reduced field of buyers. Young cattle were well supplied as were cows while there were limited numbers of export cattle.

Very good overnight rain provided a boost in the young cattle market with restockers almost guaranteed an outstanding season. There was significant improvement in the light and medium weight yearling steers. The better quality light weight yearling heifers sold on a mostly firm market trend. There was an odd slightly dearer sale while the plainer quality lots lost a little ground. The medium and heavy weights saw attracted less competition to sell to a slightly cheaper trend.

The small numbers of heavy grown steers suitable to process sold to a cheaper trend with the well finished grown heifers following a similar trend. There was a reduction in the cow market in line with what has happened at other recent markets with all but a few restocker cows much cheaper than the sale of a fortnight ago. A large offering of bulls sold to a slightly cheaper trend."
"There was a reduction in supply with wet weather over the weekend contributing. The quality of the offering was very mixed with a greater percentage of plain and secondary quality cattle penned. There was a full field of buyers in attendance. Demand was high through most categories.

Restocker demand was high on the back of the recent rain event with a bumper Spring almost assured. This resulted in the light and medium weight yearling steers selling to a dearer trend with most of the good quality lots showing considerable improvement. Heavy weight feeder steers  also attracted strong competition to also show a dearer trend. Restockers were also active in the heifer classes as were feedlotters, trends dearer. There were limited supplies of well finished heifers suitable to the trade, no comparison from the last sale available.

There were too few good quality grown steers to quote with the majority down on quality and falling into the manufacturing steer category. They sold strongly given the quality on display. There was less competition on the well finished grown heifers with the market easing. A strong cow market saw trends dearer with the heavyweights improving by as much as 13c/kg."
"There was a reduction in supply by 600 head. The quality and condition of the offering was generally not as good as the previous sale. The exception being some very good heavy weight cows. There were limited numbers of well finished cattle to suit processors. Processor demand was weaker and there were less participants. The usual feedlot orders were in place along with some extra competition. 

The quality of the young cattle was a major factor in the significant price changes that were mainly in the negative. Market trends through the young cattle to restock and feed were generally cheaper. There were however isolated sales in both the steers and the heifers that held up reasonably well.

There were odd pens of grown steers and heifers suitable to feed that also held up close to levels of the last sale. Generally however market trends were cheaper. Limited availability and a lack of competition saw well finished grown steers and heifers to process much cheaper. Significantly cheaper trends through the cow market with limited processor competition. Heavy bulls were also much cheaper."
"There was a reduction in overall numbers with young cattle well supplied. The quality of the offering was very mixed with the majority of the cattle presented in plain to fair condition. This is a reflection of one of the toughest spring seasons in sometime. There were some well-bred lots available to restock and feed orders. Buyer activity was limited with reduced restocker competition and restricted processor activity. Market trends were generally cheaper.

Vealers to both the trade and restockers sold to a substantially cheaper trend with reduced competition. The quality of the vealers was also down. Lightweight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend with quality also contributing. There were odd pens of certain breeds that remained firm. Medium weight yearling steers to feed remained firm. Good quality C muscle heifer yearlings to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend of 6c to 10c/kg. Secondary quality lightweight yearling steers and heifers experienced some quite large discounting with restockers not prepared to take on cattle for the longer term.

There was a limited supply of heavy grown steers with the market trend 1c to 6c/kg cheaper. Grown heifers with 2 or more teeth were more plentiful, however there were limited numbers of well finished lots.Plain condition heifers to restock sold firm to dearer with the availability of straight lines a benefit. The cow market saw a firm to cheaper trend with the plainer condition medium weights least affected. The bright spot in the market was the dearer trend for heavy bulls with prices as much as 33c/kg dearer."
"There was a reduction in overall numbers with weaners and yearling heifers well supplied. Quality and condition was fair to good with a few well finished lots throughout most categories. There was reduced processor competition from the regular buyers, however a new buyer operated on export cattle. Feedlot competition was also restricted while restockers were active.

Demand was weaker due to recent downturns in prices. This resulted in cheaper trends through most classes of young cattle. The light and medium weight weaner steers to restockers were significantly cheaper, some of that change was breed and quality related. The heavier steer weaners remained close to firm. There were similar trends through the heifer weaners to restock. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend of 15c to 25c/kg. Yearling heifers to restock and feed saw  a cheaper trend with the large price reduction in medium weight feeder heifers due to the joining status of those heifers. The good quality heifers to restockers saw a firm to cheaper market trend.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. The cow market was generally cheaper with the well finished heavy weights down by 4c to 6c/kg. The medium weight cows saw greater price falls. The single pen of plain condition light weight cows attracted strong competition from restockers to record a much dearer price."
"There was a reduction in numbers, with producers opting to add weight to cattle given the very good seasonal conditions. All grades were represented with young cattle and cows best supplied. Not all regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market saw trends vary. Vealer steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 5c to 29c/kg. The heifer vealers to the trade suffered under less competition to also sell to a cheaper trend, the low numbers however saw the average quality improve with this accounting for the increase in price change. Light and heavy yearling steers sold to a dearer trend, while the medium weights suffered from both a drop in quality and a reduction in competition to show a cheaper trend, down 5c to 6c/kg. Heifer yearlings experienced little change in the market trend.

Heavy steers sold cheaper, down 3c/kg with age a factor. Grown heifers remained firm. The cow market saw a dearer trend with some processors struggling to fill kill requirements. The average increase was 4c with an isolated pen of very high yielding cows selling at 164c/kg."
"There was a reduction in numbers, with forecasts of useful rain events for the week, however these did not eventuate. The quality of the offering was very mixed and consisted of large numbers of plain condition, light weight young cattle. There were some good quality and well finished lots scattered through most categories. The usual buying orders were in attendance, along with some extra restocker competition.

A drop in quality contributed to the cheaper prices recorded for vealer steers returning to the paddock. Vealer heifers to the trade sold to a dearer trend for an improved quality offering, while those to restock remained firm. There was greater demand for yearling steers to restock and feed, with trend 6c to 9c/kg dearer, and more in places. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed sold firm to dearer with some quality variation.

There were too few well finished heavy grown steers to quote. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, up to 5c/kg. Plain condition light weight cows sold to a cheaper trend, with a large variation in quality through the class. Medium and heavy weight cows sold to a dearer trend, with the 1 and 2 score medium weight cows showing an improvement in quality and also attracting increased restocker competition."
"There was a reduction in numbers, with a little vendor reluctance after the previous weaker market. Plain condition, lightweight yearlings made up a big percentage of the offering with cows also well supplied. There were very few well-condition young cattle, this reflecting the poor seasonal conditions. In contrast there were some well finished heavy cows and a few good heavy steers. There was reduced export processor competition, while restocker competition increased quite a bit, no doubt drawn out by the previous drop in prices. The increased competition saw the plain lightweight cattle sell to a dearer trend. Export cattle sold firm to dearer also.

Plain condition lightweight yearling steers averaged 8c to 17c/kg dearer with the plainer quality lightweights showing the greatest improvement. Medium and heavy yearling steers were up to 1c/kg dearer. The dearer trend continued into the heifer yearlings with averages up 5c to 18c/kg. Once again the plainer quality lightweights experienced the biggest increase. It was obvious restockers were keen to purchase the lower priced cattle in the face of the season, hoping to gain a greater advantage should the weather change and market improves.

Despite the reduced export competition the market for grown cattle was firm to dearer, with heavy grown steers seeing little but quality related price change. Competition between cow buyers was strong with the market for the best of the heavy weights remaining firm, odd sales slightly dearer. A bit more competition for plain condition and medium weight cows saw all grades in the light and medium weight classes sell to a dearer trend."
"There was a reduction in numbers, not uncommon for this time of the year on the Tablelands. All categories represented with a good supply of young cattle. Overall the quality and condition showed a great variation. Some very well bred yearlings and quite a few mixed breed pens. The usual processors were in attendance, however given the low availability of suitable cattle not all operated to capacity. There was good restocker and feedlot activity.

Trends varied through the young cattle, mostly cheaper however. Quality and breed accounted for some of the larger price changes. Light weight yearling steers to restock saw trends from 16c to 30c/kg cheaper. Medium and heavy weights in limited supply saw a cheaper trend of 15c/kg. The better quality yearling heifers in all weight classes sold to cheaper trends, both breed and quality contributing. Demand and competition from restockers not as strong with some significant price falls. The plainer quality light weights, representing lower dollar values attracted stronger competition and sold to a dearer trend.

The limited supply of heavy grown steers saw a cheaper trend as demand weakened. There were also a few manufacturing steers penned, no market trend available. The cow market was from 14c to 25c/kg cheaper, with processor demand well below the previous sale. The bull market took the biggest hit with limited processor competition, they were as much as 55c/kg cheaper on heavy weights."
"There was a reduction in numbers, more so in the grown cattle section, with a good supply of vealers and yearlings. There were no heavy steers to speak of while cows made up the bulk of the export offering. All of the regular export processors were in attendance, although there was reduced trade competition and a couple of last weeks restocker orders were absent. The quality of the yarding was fair to good with a few well finished young cattle and cows alongside runs of well-bred vealers and yearlings.

Trends varied through the young cattle with very strong demand for the lighter weight steer vealers from restockers. This resulted in a dearer trend of up to 20c/kg. Good demand from the heavier end saw the trend 5c to 8c/kg dearer. Demand for heifer vealers was not as strong with the market trend firm to slightly cheaper. There was little change in the market trend for light and medium weight yearling steers to restockers, the lightweight class including weaned cattle. A premium was paid for the weaned steers. Heavy yearling steers attracted strong feedlot demand to sell to a dearer trend. A plainer quality penning of light and medium weight yearling heifers in condition to suit restockers sold to a cheaper trend with the drop in quality contributing to the lower price change. There was a very good quality penning of heavy yearling heifers suitable to the trade and they sold to a dearer trend.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote a trend. There was little change in the cow market with hardly any restocker competition on the plainer condition cows. Any price variation was quality related."
"There was a reduction in numbers, although vealer numbers remained high. There was also a good supply of cows, while there were few heavy grown steers suitable to processors. The overall quality of the offering was good, with condition variable. There was an extra trade order in place alongside all the usual buyers. Overall the market showed signs of easing as supplies start to catch up with demand.

There was a very good quality offering of heavy steer vealers, while the light and medium weights were up to the usual standard. The market was firm to slightly cheaper, down 2c/kg. Heifer vealers also sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 4c/kg, with an odd sale slightly more. There were only a small number of yearling steers penned and quality was mixed, contributing to cheaper prices, down 6c to 8c/kg. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed saw little change, while those good enough for the trade sold firm to dearer, but only on the very best heavily muscled lots.

The majority of the grown steers sold to feedlots at firm to slightly cheaper rates. The cow market eased throughout all classes, down 5c to 7c/kg."
"There was a reduction in numbers with young cattle predominant. There were a few cows and very few grown cattle. There was limited processor competition, however there was good restocker support. There were a few vealers penned coming off cows, however at this time of the year most of the young cattle were weaned. There were some good quality lots alongside secondary cattle, yet condition was mostly plain.

Quality was a factor in the cheaper average prices for the vealer steers to restock. Vealer heifers to the processors generally showed a firm trend. Lightweight yearling steers to restock saw the good quality lines of sought after breeds sell to a dearer trend, up 3c/kg. The medium weights sold to a cheaper trend with breed quality a factor. Yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend throughout with limited competition, while quality was a major contributing factor.

There were too few grown steers and heifers to quote a market trend. The cows averaged dearer for quality on what was a generally firm market trend."
"There was a reduction in numbers with young cattle making up the majority. There were a few grown steers and heifers alongside a handy line up of cows. The overall quality of the young cattle was mixed, and this had an effect on some price variations. The regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market experienced cheaper trends throughout all grades. Vealer steers to restock were down by 16c to 18c/kg. Heifer vealers to the trade sold firm to 9c cheaper with the better quality lots least affected. The plainer quality seen in the lightweight yearling steers to restock contributed greatly to a large fall in average prices on a cheaper market trend. The medium weight yearling steers sold firm to slightly dearer as buyers were looking for cattle with enough weight to finish before winter. Heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend through all grades trends down by 5c to 18c/kg. There were some very well finished heifers to the trade that were least affected.

Heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, down 2c to 3c/kg. Plainer condition cows sold to a cheaper trend. Some intense competition saw the better medium and heavy weight cows sell to a firm trend, while quality contributed to price variations also."
"There was a reduction in numbers with young cattle making up the bulk of the offering. There were a few heavyweight manufacturing steers and cows made up 20%. The quality was mixed and condition tended toward plain. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market that showed varying trends.

Lightweight vealer steers sold to restockers up to 20c/kg dearer. Lightweight yearling steers to restockers sold firm to cheaper, with a drop in quality playing a major role in the price variations. The trade and heavyweight yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold to a cheaper trend. Buyers are showing a preference for the medium and heavyweight steers. Yearling heifers sold firm to slightly dearer for lightweights while the C3 trade weights were 4c/kg dearer.

Grown heifers with 2 or more teeth sold up to 5c/kg dearer. Most of the older steers carried their full mouth and fell into the manufacturing steer category with nothing to compare them against. The cow market saw good restocker demand for the plain condition 2 scores which made 5c/kg dearer. Medium weight 3 score cows to processors sold to a dearer trend up 9c/kg. There was little change in the heavyweight cow market."
"There was a reduction in numbers with yearlings and cows making up the bulk of the offering. There was a fair supply of grown heifers and bulls, while calf numbers declined. The quality and condition of the offering was on the plainer side. There were odd pens of well bred young cattle showing the effects of the drought. There were limited supplies of well finished cattle apart from cows and bulls to suit processors. There was reduced export processor competition. Restockers were active and there was some feedlot competition. 

The best of the calves remained firm with the plainer calves much cheaper. There were increased supplies of vealers with the best of them selling strongly to restockers. Quality and breed were major drivers in price change through the yearlings. The better quality lots saw a firm to slightly dearer market trend. The secondary and very plain quality and condition light weight yearlings attracted weaker demand and competition to show cheaper trends.

The plainer condition grown heifers to feedlotters sold to cheaper trends of around 7c/kg. Restocker and feedlot competition underpinned the plain condition cow market somewhat. The plainest of the cows were much cheaper however. The more suitable cows only slightly cheaper. The reduced processor competition resulted in the well finished cows selling to a cheaper trend of as much as 15c/kg. Heavy bulls were also impacted by the reduced competition with the best as much as 8c/kg cheaper."
"There was a reduction in numbers with weaners and cows well supplied. On average the quality and condition of the offering showed improvement with very few secondary and plain quality young cattle penned. The regular processors were in attendance, demand increasing. The usual restocker and feedlot orders were also in place.

Demand for the good quality young cattle increased with medium weight weaner steers to restockers dearer, up to 5c/kg. The heavier weights experienced strong gains aided by an improvement in both quality and supply. Heifer vealers to the trade sold to a dearer trend, up to 7c/kg. There were limited supplies of light and medium weight yearling steers, while heavy weights were well supplied. The market for those heavy feeders was dearer by as much as 20c/kg with some of the improvement attributable to breed. Medium and heavy yearling heifers to feed saw a firm to slightly dearer market trend. Those to the trade were up to 7c/kg dearer.

Demand from export processors was high with good rain in the north a factor. Well finished heavy grown steers and heifers saw dearer trends of 5c to 6c/kg with some age related improvement in the steers. Well finished cows also sold to a dearer trend, up to 9c/kg. A good supply of plainer condition medium and heavy weight cows sold to a cheaper trend with few purchased by restockers. There was little change in the bull market."
"There was a reduction in numbers with the overall quality of the offering very mixed. All categories were represented with a limited supply of well finished young cattle available to the trade. A number of well finished pens of cows and heavy manufacturing steers were also offered. There was less restocker and feedlot competition however the regular export processors were in attendance.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with quality also contributing to some price variations. Steer vealers to restockers were substantially cheaper however there were none of the lightweight Angus cattle of the previous few weeks. That was also the case in the heifer vealers to restock with prices also substantially cheaper. Limited processor competition for vealers saw the heifers up to 8c/kg cheaper. The good quality medium and heavy yearling steers to feed saw little change in the market trend. Plain quality lightweight steers to restock were much cheaper however the better muscled steers remained firm due to a slight improvement in quality. The better quality yearling heifers also saw little change, while the plainer quality heifers to restock sold to a cheaper trend.

Heavy grown steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend with reduced competition. Steers to processor were also cheaper. Full mouth manufacturing steers sold to a cheaper trend of 12c/kg with a drop in quality accounting for the greater price fall. The cow market was cheaper throughout, down 13c to 17c/kg with demand weaker. There were some plainer condition cows to restock that remained firm."
"There was a reduction in numbers with some good follow up rain to last weekâ€™s falls. Half the offering was comprised of vealers, with all other categories represented. Cows made up the bulk of the grown cattle. The quality of the offering was mixed, with the steer vealers well below the previous week. There were a small number of good heavy steers, however there were few well finished trade cattle. All regular processors were in attendance, while despite the rain there was less restocker competition.

It was a market of irregular trends, with weaner steers to restock generally cheaper. There was the odd dearer sale, while breed quality had an effect on price change.
Heifer vealers sold to a dearer trend, up 7c to 9c/kg and more in places to both the processors and restockers. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend, with reduced competition and quality reductions contributing to the fall. Heifer yearlings also saw a large drop in supply and quality.

Supply issues due to wet weather contributed to dearer trends through the grown cattle. Heavy steers also showed a quality improvement, both age and finish related. There was little change in the market trend for plain condition cows to restock. Cows to the processors generally sold to a dearer trend with the best heavy weights up 2c/kg, while quality variations accounted for other price changes."
"There was a reduction in numbers with none of the larger lines that have seen in the past couple of weeks. There were cattle in all categories, including a large number of dairy bred steers. Overall the quality and condition was mixed. There were a few well finished cows alongside some good quality weaners and yearling heifers. There was reduced competition on feeder cattle, however there was increased export processor participation.

There were varying trends through the young cattle. Weaner steers to restock sold to a slightly dearer trend. Increased numbers of heifer weaners were also dearer, with quality improving. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to cheaper trends with the reduced competition. Quality was a factor in price change, heavy weights improving, while the quality of the medium weights declined. Despite there being reduced competition, medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to feed sold firm to dearer with some quality related price changes.

Grown steers to feed experienced little price change. The big increase in the market was in cows. The extra processor participation, brought about by shortfalls in supply, saw average prices improve by 17c to 39c/kg with quality improvements accounting for some of the biggest price increases. Heavy bulls sold to a cheaper trend."
"There was a reduction in numbers with females making up a large percentage of the yarding. The quality and condition of the offering was mostly plain, however there were odd better quality and condition lots throughout. There was a similar buying group in attendance when compared to the previous sale. Market trends were generally cheaper, however there were some exceptions. Restockers showed some concern for the prevailing weather conditions, while processors are not lacking supply.

Some of the better quality yearling steers to restockers remained firm with the balance cheaper. The small number of medium weight yearlings saw prices improve in line with a quality improvement. Light weight yearling heifers saw variations in trends with the better quality C muscles up to 15c/kg cheaper. Some of the lightweight D muscles managed to remain firm, while all others sold to a cheaper trend.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote a trend. Grown heifers were presented in larger numbers with the market for well finished C muscles to process up to 7c/kg dearer. The balance of the heifers sold to a cheaper trend, some average prices improving from a quality perspective. The cow market sold to a cheaper trend with heavy weights down 3c to 6c/kg. The medium weight 2 and 3 score cows were hardest hit, falling 10c to 18c/kg. Bulls sold much cheaper with quality contributing to some large price reductions."
"There was a reduction in numbers with cows with young cattle well supplied. There was limited offering of good quality grown steers and heifers. The overall quality of the yarding was fair and the majority of the well finished cattle were female, either cows or yearling heifers. The regular buyers were in attendance.

Steer vealers to restock sold at cheaper prices, down 5c to 12c/kg, however there was a drop in average quality. Light and medium weight vealer heifers to the trade sold firm with variation is quality, while those to restockers were cheaper, down 4c/kg. Quality was an issue in the yearling steers to restock and feeder buyers with prices cheaper across most weights. Medium and heavy heifer yearlings to the trade were firm to slightly dearer.

The majority of the grown steers penned were older with 6 or more teeth and went back to the paddock. The cow market was solid throughout with prices generally firm, odd sales 2c to 4c/kg dearer."
"There was a reduction in numbers in what was a very mixed quality penning. Young cattle were well supplied while cows and older heifers made up the bulk of the grown cattle offering. The regular processors were in attendance however there was reduced feedlot competition. There were some well finished young cattle suitable to the trade while restockers were well catered for.

Restockers were active on the lower dollar value cattle, with light and medium weight steers vealers remaining close to firm. Heifer vealers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 9c/kg. The reduced competition combined with a drop in quality saw medium and heavy feeder steers sell to a cheaper trend of 20c to 30c/kg. A little more competition for heifer yearlings suitable to feed reduced the fall in the market, the trend cheaper by 9c/kg. Well finished medium and heavy heifer yearlings to the trade remain firm.

There were no heavy grown steers to quote. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend. There was less competition from restockers on the plainer condition cows with trends through all classes cheaper, down by 6c to 7c/kg."
"There was a reduction in numbers however young cattle and cows were well supplied. The majority of the offering was good quality while there were some secondary cattle through most categories. There was a large contingent of buyers present that included all the regulars and extra feedlot and processor competition.

Market trends varied through the young cattle. Vealer steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend, with the light and medium weights up 2c/kg. The average quality lifted prices by more. Heavyweights were well sought after by feedlots and backgrounders, selling to a dearer trend of as much as 20c/kg. Heifer vealers to restock generally remained firm while very few sold in the price range of processors. Medium weight yearling steers benefitted from the extra competition, selling to a dearer trend of up to 11c/kg, while limited feedlot activity and a drop in quality saw heavyweights sell to a cheaper trend, with most going back to the paddock. Good quality heifer yearlings to restock and feed sold firm to slightly dearer. Secondary quality heifers met weaker demand selling to a cheaper trend. 

There were no milk and 2 tooth heavy steers penned and the 4 and 6 tooth steers remained firm. Competition and demand for plain condition cows from both restockers and processors increased, with the market showing a firm to dearer trend. Improved quality contributed to the better 3 and 4 score heavy weight cows also recording a firm to slightly dearer market trend."
"There was a reduction in numbers following useful rainfall. Vealers were well supplied in an offering where all categories were well represented. Cattle suitable to restock and feed were plentiful. The overall quality of the penning was good and there was a good supply of well finished cattle. The full complement of regular buyers was in attendance and there was extra feedlot competition.

Demand was high through all categories, resulting in dearer trends throughout most. Vealers steers to restock were 12c to 25c/kg dearer. There was similar improvement in vealer heifers to both the trade and restocker orders. Quality variations accounted for price changes outside these quotes. Medium and heavy yearling steers attracted increased feedlot competition to sell up to 20c/kg dearer. There was an increased percentage of Angus and Angus cross steers penned, with this impacting on price change also. Yearling heifers to feed also attracted keen demand to sell to a dearer trend of 6c to 10c/kg. The quality of this weekâ€™s offering differed somewhat to last weekâ€™s from a breed perspective. Well finished yearling heifers suitable to the trade followed a similar dearer trend.

There was an increased supply of feeder steers carrying 2 or more permanent teeth, with the majority being of the Angus breed. Prices were significantly dearer as a result along with increased demand. Well finished heavy steers sold to a dearer trend, with some age related price change. Buyers prepared to pay more for steers with 4 teeth or less. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, up to 17c/kg. The market for heavy cows was very strong, up 4c to 5c/kg, and more on a few high yielding lots. Medium weight 2 score cows were firm to slightly cheaper. Restockers were active on the better quality lots."
"There was a reduction in numbers following good rains across the district. All categories were represented, yearling steers having the largest percentage. The quality was mixed through all categories , with condition also showing great variation. A reduced gallery of buyers with export processor activity restricted. There was strong restocker demand in places.

Breed and weight were factors in a substantially dearer market trend for light weight yearling steers to restockers where competition on some lots was extreme. The heavier weight classes sold to substantially cheaper trends with reduced competition. The high dollar outlay stopping some restockers. The light weight yearling heifers to restockers also sold to a much dearer market trend with odd pens posting significant improvement. Well finished heavy weight yearling heifers to the trade sold to a dearer trend of as much as 30c/kg with a quality improvement.

Limited supplies of grown steers sold to cheaper trends with most usually purchased by feedlots purchased by a local restocker. Despite restricted processor competition the heavy weight cow market was slightly dearer. Heavy bulls sold to cheaper trends with little competition.

Market reporter, James Armitage"
"There was a reduction in numbers despite a 2 week layoff due to public holidays. All categories with the exception of grown steers were well represented. The quality and condition of the offering was very mixed, tending towards plain. Well finished cattle were scarce. Most of the usual buyers attended. There was reduced feedlot competition on yearling heifers, but increased restocker competition for cows.

Market trends varied through the young cattle. Plainer quality and condition vealers to restockers were significantly cheaper, with quality contributing to some substantial price decreases. The good quality steer vealers to restock sold firm to slightly dearer. A single heavy vealer steers destined for the show circuit was a standout sale. Heifer vealers to processors attracted limited interest to show a much cheaper trend. A small number suitable to a local butcher were as much as 16c/kg dearer. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a slightly dearer trend. There was some breed and quality related price change. The reduced competition for feeder heifers resulted in significantly cheaper trends for those suitable.

The cow market experienced cheaper trends, despite the increased restocker competition. The majority of the offering were 1 and 2 scores, with the plainest condition lots failing to attract much demand. The few well finished cows saw a cheaper trend of 6c/kg, with the exception of a single cow. The bull market saw a dearer trends with a strong live export order in place. The plainer quality and condition bulls showed the greatest improvement."
"There was a reduction in numbers brought about by the weekend rainfall. Young cattle were well supplied with limited supplies in all other categories. The quality of the offering was very mixed and there were limited supplies of well finished young cattle. The usual buyers were in place and demand was strong for all classes.

Market trends through the young cattle saw light and medium weight steer vealers to restockers sell to a dearer trend, while the heavier weights to backgrounders were firm to slightly cheaper. Heifer vealers to both restockers and the trade were generally dearer however there was some quality related negative price change in those to the trade. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed sold on a firm to dearer market trend with most of the price movement in the medium weights. There was an improvement in the average quality of the heavy feeders. Yearling heifers to restock and feed were 3c to 10c/kg dearer.

Well finished heavy grown steers and heifers sold to a dearer trend. There were strong price gains for all classes of cows with an improvement in the quality of the best heavy weights."
"There was a reduction in numbers as the heightened level of turn-off leading into winter starts to slow. Vealers and cows were well supplied, but there was a reduced penning of yearlings. There were fair numbers of grown steers and heifers, although there were not many good quality and conditioned lots available. Overall the quality and condition of the offering was mixed. The usual processors were in attendance however there was less feedlot and restocker competition. 

Light and medium weight vealer steers to restock sold firm to dearer, with medium weights improving up to 11c/kg. Heavier weights sold to a dearer trend, despite reduced competition. Vealer heifers sold to a dearer trend of 1c to 3c/kg. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, again despite reduced competition, with breed also a factor in price improvement. Well finished yearling heifers to the trade sold to a dearer trend, up 1c to 9c/kg.

The quality of the grown steers was fairly plain and was reflected in the price variation. Well-bred steers sold to restockers and lot feeders at dearer prices. The better quality grown heifers were firm to dearer, however the plainer grades sold to a cheaper trend. The cow market was firm to cheaper, with the well finished medium and heavy cows most affected. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"There was a reduced, mixed penning of 350 today, back 340 head on last sale. Weaner numbers were much reduced as were yearling cattle. Cow numbers increased to 128 head. All regular processors and restockers were active.

Steer weaners showed a cheaper trend while the heifer portion was slightly dearer. Both yearling steers and heifers were marginally cheaper.

There were no numbers of grown steers and heifers yarded for a reliable quote. Better cows showed a cheaper trend, while the plainer types held firm. Bulls were firm."
"There was a reduced penning, with quality fair to good. The overall condition of the offering improved, with an increased supply of well finished yearling heifers, grown steers and cows. The improved condition and quality of the grown cattle saw an increase in processor competition. Market trends were mixed.

Vealer steers to restockers saw little but quality related price change. There were too few yearling steers to quote. Yearling heifers to restockers sold to a dearer trend while there was no market comparison for well finished heifers.

Heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, despite a lift in weight and quality. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, with increased numbers of 2 tooth cattle. Cows were dearer, with processor active on the better cows. Restockers competed on the plainer condition lots."
"There was a reduced penning, however all categories were represented. Weaners, heavy yearling steers and cows were well represented, while there were no good quality well finished heavy grown steers penned. Overall the quality was fair to good with condition mixed. There was a little less processor competition on heavy cattle while the same restocker and feedlot buyers were in place.

Market trends varied throughout the young cattle sale and quality variations also impacted some prices. Weaners to restock sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend with both steers and heifers affected. The total numbers being marketed through the system and some quality variation were a factor. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed remained firm. Medium and heavy yearling heifers purchased by restockers sold to a cheaper trend, averaging 6c/kg easier.

No quote was possible for well finished grown steers to process, with most falling into the manufacturing category. There was little change in the cow market for those to process. Restocker cows sold to a slightly dearer trend. Heavy bulls were firm to slightly dearer also."
"There was a reduced penning with wet weather about. Once again vealers were well represented along with yearlings and cows. The quality was mixed with a greater number of plainer cattle penned. The regular orders were in place for a market of cheaper trends. There were some variations attributable to quality.

Steer vealers to restock were 4c to 19c/kg cheaper with an odd sale firm as quality and breed were a factor. Heifer vealers to the trade and restock fell by 13c to 18c/kg with quality adding more in some cases. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw lightweights sell dearer due to an improved average quality, while the medium and heavy weights were cheaper by 1c to 7c/kg. Heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend, down 7c to 12c/kg, with quite a bit of restocker and feeder activity at the reduced prices.

Heavy grown steers struggled with the market trend 10c to 12c/kg cheaper. Grown heifers sold at dearer prices with feedlot competition on improved average quality. The cow market eased with the trend 1c to 3c/kg cheaper on average."
"There was a reduced penning with weaners and cows making up the bulk of the offering. There were limited supplies in all other categories. The quality of the offering was mixed with a fair supply of well bred weaners and some well finished cows. There was restricted processor competition, while restockers were still active.

Market trends varied in the young cattle with the lighter weight weaner steers to restockers selling to a cheaper trend, breed was a factor. The heavier steer weaners sold to a dearer trend with restockers looking to take more weight into winter. Heifer weaners to restock attracted keen demand selling to a dearer trend. The limited supply of yearlings attracted reduced competition to sell to a cheaper trend and substantially so in places.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. Well finished grown heifers and cows suffered from the restricted processor competition, selling to a cheaper trend. The plainer condition cows attracted strong competition from restockers with that market 10c to 15c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"There was a reduced penning with weaner and yearling steers in good supply. Cows had a strong representation and there were more well finished grown steers than in recent sales. The quality of the penning was quite mixed, particularly through the yearlings. There were quite a few well finished cattle penned, mostly in the grown section. The usual processors were in attendance as were the usual restocker and feedlot orders.

Market trends varied along with quality through the young cattle with this factor contributing to price changes. Light weight weaner steers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend. The medium and heavy weaner steers sold to a dearer trend with lower numbers available this week. Light and medium weight heifer weaners to restockers sold to a cheaper trend while the heavy weights were dearer. Breed quality was a major factor in price improvement in the good quality medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed. The market trend for the secondary quality steers was cheaper. A mostly plain quality penning of heifer yearlings sold to cheaper trends to restockers and feed.

An improvement in quality saw heavy grown steers to processors sell to a dearer trend. There was plenty of restocker competition for plain condition cows, either joined or preg tested empty, this resulted in a dearer trend. The well finished medium and heavy weight cows saw demand ease with a cheaper trend the result. Heavy bulls remained firm."
"There was a reduced penning with the quality very mixed. There were quite a few very plain quality and conditioned young cattle showing the effects of a tough winter. There were conversely a few pens of very well-finished yearling heifers and some very good cows. The regular processors were in attendance, along with good localised restocker competition. There were varying trends through the market.

The plain quality and conditioned lightweight vealer steers sold very well to restockers, with the market trend up to 10c/kg dearer. Similar vealer heifers also sold to a dearer trend. Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold firm to slightly dearer, with some quality related price changes. The plain lightweight yearling heifers experienced quality related price variation. Well-finished yearling heifers attracted both trade and feedlot competition, to sell to a dearer trend, up to 10c/kg.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. Well-finished grown heifers were up to 5c/kg dearer. The cow market was generally cheaper, with plain conditioned cows down 4c/kg. Heavy 3 and 4 score cows were as much as 8c/kg cheaper. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend, with the best lines selling up to 4c/kg dearer."
"There was a reduced penning with numbers falling by more than 50%, not uncommon at this time of the year with the large early sell-off. There were limited numbers in each category with cows best represented. The quality and condition of the offering was plain for the most part. There were odd pens of well finished, good quality yearlings. The usual processors were in attendance. Restocker and feedlot participation was similar to the previous week.

Quality variations were the main factors in price change through the young cattle. The well bred and better quality young cattle were well received by restockers and feedlot buyers, however the plain quality and condition young cattle struggled to attract much competition from restockers. Vealers to restockers sold to varying trends with the good quality lots dearer and the plain and secondary cattle cheaper. Medium weight yearling steers to feed attracted strong competition and sold to a dearer trend of 6c/kg and more in places. Heavy feeders also attracted strong competition on breed specific lots. Trends varied for yearling heifers to restock and feed, while the few that were good enough for the trade were cheaper.

Breed was a factor in varying trends through the grown heifers, where condition was mostly plain. There was limited demand from restockers for the plain condition cows, this and quality resulted in cheaper trends. The lightweight cows were greatly affected. The limited supply of well finished heavy weight cows were up to 5c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls sold to a cheaper trend, up to 6c/kg."
"There was a reduced penning with cows, vealers and yearlings making up a large percentage. There was an increase in the number of bulls penned, making up almost 10% of the total. From all reports the quality was quite mixed. There was similar processor and feedlot competition, a couple of returning orders replacing some absenteeâ€™s. Local restocker activity was strong.

Light and medium weight vealer steers to restockers sold on a firm to dearer market trend, up 10c to 16c/kg. The heifer vealers to restockers sold to cheaper trends. There were cheaper trends also through the yearling steers to restock and feed. Quite a large price range depending on breed and quality. Odd better quality pens of yearling heifers were dearer, the plainer quality lots selling to a cheaper trend.

Cows were again cheaper with medium weights down around 6c/kg. The heavy weight cows were as much as 13c/kg cheaper."
"There was a reduced penning this week, with yearlings well supplied but a limited number of suitable export cattle. There was limited processor competition, both trade and export, however there was more competition for restocker cattle. The quality of the young cattle was very mixed and there were very few well finished yearlings. There were no heavy grown steers to quote, however there were some very good cows penned.

A variable market trend was seen through the young cattle, with the better quality light weight yearling steers to restock selling to a slightly cheaper trend, while the very light weight secondary quality steers sold to a dearer trend as buyers looked for the low dollar cattle. There was a better quality penning of medium weights that also sold to a dearer trend. The better quality yearling heifers sold close to firm.

There were not enough heavy grown steers to quote. Despite the restricted competition the cow market was firm to slightly dearer."
"There was a reduced penning this fortnight. Yearling cattle made up the bulk of the offering with a few in each of the other categories. The quality and condition of the penning was mixed with some very good quality and conditioned cattle penned. There was increased export processor competition, however not all regular buyers were in attendance.

Restocker and feedlot demand was high, this resulting in dearer trends through the yearlings. Light weight yearling steers to restock experienced a moderate increase. Medium and heavy weight feeder and restocker steers saw a dearer trend of 18c to 20c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers attracted keen demand to sell to a dearer trend of as much as 25c/kg with breed also contributing. Medium and heavy weight feeder heifers also posted strong gains. There was little change in the market for the limited supply of trade yearlings.

Heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, with the well finished heavy heifers also slightly cheaper. The increased competition in the export cattle saw the cow market as much as 17c dearer, while a very strong heavy bull market saw a trend as much as 18c/kg dearer."
"There was a reduced penning this fortnight. Autumn drop vealers and weaners were in fair numbers with limited supplies of yearlings. Cows, grown heifers and bulls made up the export section and no heavy steers were penned. The overall quality of the offering was fair to good with most of the weaners and a few heavy yearling steers presenting very well. The usual buyers were in attendance, however feedlot competition was limited.

Demand for young cattle returning to the paddock was very strong with the current season and rain forecast. Whilst there is no market comparison on the weaners from a fortnight ago, local restocker interests competed strongly to elevate values to levels not seen recently for similar cattle. The few heavy yearling steers sold to a restocker at a firm market trend with breed being a price variance. There were too few yearling heifers to quote.

Well finished grown heifers to process sold to a dearer trend with prices showing significant improvement. There was a line of PTIC grown heifers and cows that attracted strong competition from restockers. The cow market was also much dearer, with the best of the heavy weights as much as 18c/kg dearer than the previous market. The bull market was also much dearer with processor competition very strong."
"There was a reduced penning that saw all categories represented. A good supply of cows and vealers was penned, while there were limited numbers of grown steers. The quality and condition of the offering tended towards plain, which had an impact on prices. There was reduced processor competition that was selective at times. Restocker and feedlot competition was weaker.

The weaker demand and quality of the offering resulted in cheaper trends through the young cattle. Steer vealers to restock sold to a cheaper trend of as much as 40c/kg. There were greater price falls where quality was a factor. The drop in the market for heifer vealers was greater, with very few suitable to the trade, while restockers showed limited interest. The best of the heavy weight yearling feeder steers were cheaper, while the light, medium weights and secondary quality steers saw a cheaper trends from 20c to 30c/kg. The heifer yearlings to restock and feed sold to cheaper trends from 7c to 45c/kg. The smallest of the price change was breed related, with the larger reductions having a combination of breed, quality and weaker demand.

There were too few well finished heavy grown steers to quote. The large range in price for well finished grown heifers was in part related to the selective processor competition. Weaker demand for well finished cows resulted in cheaper trends from 15c to 30c/kg, with selective processor competition. Increased demand for light weight cows to restock and feed saw the lightest of the cows sell to a dearer trend."
"There was a reduced penning that comprised a good selection of vealers and cows. The majority of the vealers were purchased by restockers with limited numbers suitable to the trade. Around a quarter of the penning were cows showing a large range in condition with all 6 fat scores represented. Both quality and condition was mixed throughout. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Demand varied through the young cattle, strong on odd pens of weaner steers and not so on others. Trends varied with the medium weights averaging dearer on the back of isolated sales as much as 16c/kg dearer. Overall, however market trends were cheaper with the plainer condition light weights most affected. A slightly improved quality penning of heifer vealers saw a firm to slightly cheaper market trend with the majority purchased by restockers. The better quality medium and heavy weight yearling feeder steers remained firm, however a drop in quality saw average prices decline by 16c to 17c/kg. Odd sales of very good quality yearling heifers purchased by feedlotters were as much as 8c/kg dearer, however overall the market trend was cheaper. Throughout the young cattle market the good quality lots attracted the most competition while the plain and secondary cattle failed to attract much interest.

Well finished grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend to average between 8c and 19c/kg cheaper. There were significant reductions in the cow market with numbers through the system starting to take effect. Plain condition cow numbers are starting to out weight those carrying a fat score of 3 or better. There were a number of very high yielding heavy weight bulls penned, they contributed to a dearer market trend."
"There was a reduced penning that again featured a large penning of cows. This is a reflection of the deteriorating seasonal conditions and pre-winter, post weaning selloff. There was a fair supply of vealers and weaners, while yearling numbers retreated. The quality of the offering was fair to good as was the condition. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with weaner steers to restockers selling mostly firm with an odd dearer sale. It was a similar trend for heifer weaners and vealers with some sales to restockers up to 9c/kg dearer. A good supply of heavy yearling feeder steers sold to a dearer trend with breed a contributing factor. Yearling heifers to restock and feed saw medium and heavy weights sell to a 5c/kg cheaper market trend with limited numbers purchased by the trade.

There were too few well finished heavy grown steers to quote, however feeder steers over 500kg were dearer, and significantly so with breed and quality a major factor. The cow market was 5c to 10c/kg cheaper with restocker cows least affected. There were quite a few large framed cows in store condition penned. Heavy bulls were 4c/kg cheaper."
"There was a reduced penning overall with a large supply of vealers and yearlings, particularly steers. All other categories were represented, with cows once again making up the biggest percentage of grown cattle. The quality of the offering was fair to good with increased numbers of well finished cattle. The regular processors were in attendance and there was increased restocker competition, however feedlot activity was limited.

Quality contributed to an improvement in average prices for steer vealers to restock, on what was also a dearer market trend. Heifer vealers also sold to a dearer trend, 5c/kg with quality also contributing. Heavy yearling steers to the trade and feed were dearer, with the quality of those to feed showing a marked improvement. Heifer yearlings to the trade also sold to a dearer trend, up 3c to 4c/kg. The secondary quality young cattle also sold to a dearer trend.

Heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend with some prices back 9c/kg, however part of that fall was quality related. The cow market was dearer with increased demand from both processors and restockers, the trend for the better medium and heavy cows was 5c to 8c higher, while the plainer condition cows attracted greater increases. Once again there was a quality component in the average price changes."
"There was a reduced penning of very mixed cattle. Quality and condition was only fair in the young cattle, with some well finished cows. Not all regular processors were in attendance.

The market for young cattle saw lightweight vealers sell to a cheaper trend with the quality contributing to some big falls in price. The cheaper trend carried through to the lightweight yearling steers, were an odd sale was firm. Quality also contributed to cheaper prices. Lightweight yearling heifers reversed the trend to be dearer, up 4c to 9c/kg with restocker orders underpinning prices.

There were too few heavy grown steers to frame a market trend. Grown heifers were plentiful while the well finished heifers to the processors sold to a dearer trend. A single pen showing a little too much fat cover realised a cheaper price. The cow market was strong with heavyweights selling firm to slightly dearer, while there was little but quality related change on medium weights with average prices reduced."
"There was a reduced penning of 865 head. A large percentage were cows along with fair representation in most of the other categories. The quality of the offering was mostly good with condition varying greatly. There was a reduced field of the regular buyers however several new cow orders emerged.

Demand was weaker through the young cattle with the onset of some very cold weather and an over supply in the system. Market trends for young cattle to restock and feed were cheaper and considerably so on all but the very best quality lots. Those better quality lines were only moderately affected. Well finished heavy yearling heifers to process attracted little competition.

Well finished heavy weight grown steers and heifers to process were considerably cheaper. Plainer quality grown heifers to feed were only slightly cheaper for the 2 and 4 teeth lots. There was a restocker order operating on the better conditioned cows as well as a couple of new processors. Despite the new competition market trends were considerably cheaper throughout. Heavy bulls to process were also much cheaper."
"There was a reduced penning of 770 very mixed quality cattle, 380 less. Good drafts of well-bred weaners came forward and a large reduction of yearling cattle. Not many grown steers and heifers were available and there was an increase in cow numbers. The regular gallery of buyers attended, with feeder buyers competing on the better bred categories.

Well-bred steer weaners sold to dearer trends of 15c, with some drafts of plainer quality types showing a reduction in prices of up to 40c/kg. Heavy weights to feed on saw substantially dearer trends of 30c/kg. Variation in quality saw a mixed market for medium weight heifers with these grades selling to cheaper trends of 12c/kg. Heifers to the trade were slightly dearer at 6c/kg.

A few grown heifers on offer and these sold to a dearer market. Light 1 score cows sold to dearer trends to restockers, with processors underpinning those categories. The trade was also strong on 2 and 3 score medium weight cows, improving 7c/kg. The best 3 score cows were 10c dearer, while bulls sold to cheaper trends of 8c/kg on the heavy weights."
"There was a reduced penning of 655 head following a rain event. The majority of the offering were of good quality and presented in fair to good condition. Cows were well supplied. The usual buyers were in attendance along with the return of a major processor after a very long absence. Restockers were active throughout.

A very mixed quality penning of vealers suitable to restockers saw the steer portion remain firm while the heifers sold to cheaper trends. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers attracted good competition from both restockers and feedlots to sell to dearer trends also. Quality variations accounted for a large range in price for medium weight yearling heifers with the better quality lots firm to slightly dearer.

Heavy grown steers to processors sold to a dearer trend with increased competition with the well finished grown heifers following a similar trend. Competition and demand increased in the cow market where a line of PTIC cows reached 274c/kg to a restocker. The cows to process sold to a dearer trend with well finished heavy weights improving by 5c/kg. Improved quality and increased competition resulted in the heavy weight bulls selling to a significantly dearer market trend."
"There was a reduced penning for the final sale of the financial year with some carried over. Yearlings well supplied as were cows with all other categories limited in supply. The quality was quite good, while condition was very mixed. The usual processors and a bit more restocker and feeder competition were in attendance. It was a solid market throughout.

Light weight young cattle to restockers sold to a dearer trend. Medium and heavy yearling feeders saw a quality and supply increase in the steers, prices firm to dearer. The heifer yearlings to feed were up to 20c/kg dearer. A few well finished heifers suitable to the trade also sold to a dearer trend. 

There were too few heavy grown steers to process to quote. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend taking age into account, with quite a few of the well finished lots carrying 4 and 6 teeth. The cow market was slightly cheaper with limited numbers of well finished high yielding cows available. The increase in price for cows to restock was related to the PTIC and scanned in calf status of the cows."
"There was a reduced penning following some large rainfall over the past week and more forecast. All categories were represented in a mixed quality yarding. The condition of the cattle was fair to good and most of the regular buyers were in attendance.

Restockers showed great confidence in the market and with a large body of feed, bid strongly on most of the young cattle. This resulted in dearer trends throughout with significant improvement through the steers. There was some breed and quality related price change in light weight yearling heifers, however trends were dearer through all weight classes.

Heavy grown steers to process sold to dearer trends of 10c to 15c/kg under strong competition. Well finished grown heifers to process mostly sold to a slightly cheaper trend, quality was a factor. There was an isolated dearer sale. The cow market was firm to slightly dearer with some variation for quality. The heavy bulls met very strong competition resulting in a significantly dearer market trend.

Market Reporter, James Armitage."
"There was a reduced penning despite there only being one sale left before the Christmas break. It was a very mixed quality penning that saw quite a few very plain quality cattle penned. Yearlings and cows made up the bulk of the offering, along with a few in each of the other categories. Condition was on the plainer end, with limited numbers of well finished cattle available to processors. There was reduced processor competition, although restockers and feed lotters were active.

Market trends varied through the young cattle, with quality a factor in price changes. Light weight yearling steers were significantly cheaper. The better quality medium weights to restock and feed were least affected, easing 8c to 10c/kg. Heavy weight feeder steers were as much as 13c/kg cheaper. Yearling heifers sold to dearer trends, with some well bred, but out of condition light weights, available to restockers. The better quality heifers carrying sufficient weight to attract feedlot competition sold to a dearer trend of up to 6c/kg.

Well finished grown heifers to processors sold to a slightly dearer trend. There were cheaper trends through all classes of cows, with a great variation in quality. The well finished 3 and 4 score cows were as much as 24c/kg cheaper than a fortnight ago. The heavy bull market experienced little change."
"There was a reduced penning comprising some very good quality vealers along with quite a few plain condition cattle. There was restricted processor and feedlot activity however restockers were active.

Cheaper market trends were evident through all classes in the young cattle. No market comparisons are available on the vealers. Yearling steers and heifers to restock saw prices fall by 15c to 30c/kg and more in places.

The cheaper market trend carried through to the grown cattle, with heifers and cows experiencing similar price reductions to those of the young cattle. Heavy bulls saw the least of the price corrections."
"There was a reduced penning at Armidale cattle sale this week, with the quality fair to good. There was variation in condition, with the majority of young cattle suited to restocking and feedlot purposes. The grown cattle were well finished in the main lines with some cows carrying an excess. There was a similar gallery of processors in attendance along with good support from restocker and feedlot buyers. 

Strong restocker demand resulted in substantially dearer market trends for vealer steers. Lighter weight heifer vealers to restockers also sold to a much dearer trend. The few heavier weights were cheaper with quality contributing. Yearling steers to restock and feed also sold to dearer trends, however there was a large price range with breed and quality a factor. Yearling heifers also sold to dearer trends with the increased demand. 

Well finished heavy grown steers to process sold on a firm to slightly dearer market trend. There was little change in the cow market with some classes showing an improvement in quality. Restocker demand was high for a small number of PTIC cows. 

Market Reporter, James Armitage."
"There was a reduced penning as last season's production stocks wind down and producers look ahead to the upcoming change in season. Light weight yearlings transitioning from vealer status were well supplied. Both quality and condition through all categories showed quite a bit of variation. There was a fair supply of well finished cattle. The regular processors were in attendance, however there was a reduced presence of feedlot orders. Restockers were again active showing a preference for lighter weights.

The high restocker demand for light weight young cattle resulted in dearer trends of up to 8c/kg on steers. There were premiums paid based on the colour of the coat. The heifer portion followed a similar trend. There were large price changes also based on the transitioning. The reduced competition for heavier feeder cattle saw medium and heavy weights sell to cheaper trends of as much as 20c/kg on both steers and heifers. Well finished trade heifer yearlings sold to cheaper trends also.

Heavy grown steers sold to a slightly cheaper trend, as did the grown heifers to process. There were discounts applied to those heifers carrying 6 teeth. The cow market saw a firm to slightly cheaper trend. Bulls attracted strong competition to sell to a dearer trend."
"There was a reduced penning although young cattle, particularly vealers well supplied. Cows made up the bulk of the grown cattle offering. Quality and condition was mixed through all categories. The regular buyers were in attendance.

Restocker demand for steer vealers remained high with quality contributing to dearer average prices for the medium weights. The heavy weights were slightly cheaper. There was also increased demand from restockers for heifer vealers which gained up to 15c/kg. Heifer vealers to the trade and processors were 5c to 8c/kg cheaper. There was less weight in the yearlings and this was the contributing factor to the increased prices in the light end of the yearling steers. Medium and heavyweights also sold to a dearer trend. There were varying trends for yearling heifers with mixed quality contributing.

The improved quality run of grown steers sold to a dearer trend. All cow buyers were catered for with prices firm to slightly dearer. Restockers were active on the plain condition and PTIC lots. Bulls sold to a cheaper trend."
"There was a reduced offering that also saw an overall drop in quality. Vealers were well supplied and there were some very good heavy steers. Cows were in fair numbers although quality was not great. All but one of the regular buyers were in attendance although there was little feedlot activity.

The market trend was cheaper throughout all the young cattle. The only exception being a small lot of good quality heifer yearlings. Trade vealers were 4c to 6c/kg cheaper. There was little change on vealer steers to restockers. Yearling steers, all of which went to restockers sold cheaper, down 5c to 9c/kg. Heifer yearlings experienced similar falls with plainer quality lots showing greater falls.

The quality of the heavy steers contributed to a firm to 1c/kg cheaper trend. The top rates being for 2 tooth steers with the premium 10c to 12c/kg over the older steers. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend, down 7c to 9c/kg. 

There was restocker activity on the plainer condition cows, the trend firm to 3c cheaper, while the cows to slaughter were 1c to 5c/kg cheaper. Heavy bulls also sold to a cheaper trend."
"There was a reduced offering of mixed quality cattle. The condition of the yarding varied with a few well finished yearlings and cows alongside quite a number still showing the effects of winter. The regular export processors were in attendance, however trade competition was restricted. Once again restocker activity was strong.

The market for lightweight yearling steers to restock was cheaper, while medium weights remained firm with quality related variations. Light weight heifer yearlings to restock sold to a dearer trend, up 3c to 4c/kg. Well finished trade heifers sold well, however there were no similar heifers from the previous sale to make a market comparison.

There were insufficient heavy steers to quote a trend. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 9c/kg. A lack of restocker competition on plain condition cows saw them sell to a cheaper trend, down 5c to 10c while medium and heavy 3 and 4 score cows were firm to 5c/kg dearer.

Included in the offering were about 30 plain condition cow and calf units that sold from $750 to $970/unit."
"There was a reduced number yarded with the quality varying from plain through to very good. There were some well finished heavyweight steers in limited numbers and a few good cows. The young cattle offering consisted mostly of restocker grades with steers in limited supply. All regular processing and feeder orders were in attendance as well as the usual local restocker orders.

The limited numbers of yearling steers saw little change in the market. The heifer yearlings to restockers sold to a dearer trend as buyers changed preferences due to the lack of suitable steer lines. Values increased by 7c to 10c/kg. The limited numbers of heifers suitable to the trade remained firm.

The improved quality of the heavyweight steers brought with it an increase in value, the trend dearer. The grown heifer market was firm for the better quality grades and cheaper for the plainer quality lines. Medium weight cows sold to a dearer trend, up 1c to 5c while the heavy cows sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Heavy bulls sold firm to 4c cheaper."
"There was a reduced number this week, with the condition of the offering mostly plain. Quality was very mixed. Cows and grown heifers made up 45% of the penning. There was restricted processor competition with limited availability of suitably finished strock. There were also less restocker orders in place for the young cattle, while there were some good restocker and feeder orders for cows.

A fair supply of young calves mostly sold to cheaper trends, premiums for the male portion. In the heavier calves, the plainer D muscles recovered some of last week's losses, while breed was a factor in some price change. The majority of the yearling steers fell into the light weight class. Quality was mostly plain with this playing a role in price change. The market trend was firm to cheaper. Conversely, the market trend for the light weight yearlings was firm to slightly dearer, the quality and breed similar to that of the steers.

There was good restocker and feeder competition for grown heifers with 2 and 4 teeth, while the older heifers were discounted. The majority were D muscle 1 and 2 scores with the market trend dearer under increased competition. Plain condition cows sold to cheaper trends despite some good restocker and feeder competition. The quality and condition were also factors. Cows to process sold to dearer trends as buyers competed strongly on the limited supply. Reduced processor competition and a drop in quality resulted in a much cheaper trend in the bull market."
"There was a reduced number on offer with cows and vealers making up almost 80% of the yarding. Quality was fair to good, although the condition and freshness of the cattle is diminishing quickly. The yearling and grown steer offering was very mixed in quality. A full compliment of buyers was in attendance for a market that saw cheaper trends through most grades.

Vealer steers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend with values down by 14c/kg on medium weights, while the heavier pens showing a bit more quality were less affected. Heifer vealers also sold at cheaper rates, down 8c to 10c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend, down 5c to 8c/kg through all weight classes. Heifer yearlings were down 10c to 12c/kg with quality also deteriorating.

Heavy steers and bullocks were cheaper by 10c/kg, with full mouth steers experiencing greater falls. There was plenty of restocker competition for plainer condition cows. The market for the plain cows to both restock and process saw little change. The better condition cows to slaughter sold to a cheaper trend, down 7c to 11c/kg."
"There was a reduced number of fair to good quality cattle offered. Young cattle were well supplied, while cows made up 40% of the yarding. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market generally showing firm to dearer trends. 

Restockers were once again active on vealers and yearlings with some feedlot competition on steer yearlings. The market for steer vealers was dearer by 6c to 10c/kg on medium weights and while the heavier weights averaged cheaper it was quality related. Heifer vealers to restock followed a similar trend, with those to the trade firm to 4c/kg dearer. Medium weight yearling steers to feed sold much dearer, pushed along by restockers. Those going to restock remained firm. Heavy yearling steers to restockers suffered for breed quality and sold at cheaper prices. Medium weight yearling heifers to restock sold to a dearer trend of 2c to 9c/kg under increased demand. The limited supply of well finished trade heifers also sold to a dearer trend.

There were insufficient heavy grown steers to quote. The cow market showed variable trends. Heavy cows improved in quality and sold dearer by up to 3c/kg taking the quality improvement into account. There were a few pens of EU accredited cows offered with these attracting a premium from a particular buyer. The light and medium weight cows sold firm to 5c/kg cheaper with the plainer condition cows most affected."
"There was a reduced number of cattle penned. The overall quality of the offering was fair with a limited supply of finished cattle in any grade. All regular processing orders were in place for a market that remained strong.

The quality of the young cattle combined with an increase in average weights were the main contributing factors in the cheaper prices received for yearling steers in the light weight classes. Overall however the trend saw little change. The medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed also saw the trend remain firm with quality accounting for any other variation. There was an improved quality offering of lean, light weight heifer yearlings suitable to the trade with the market trend firm to dearer. Well finished medium and heavy 3 score heifer yearlings also sold at strong rates although a market comparison is not possible due to the absence of comparable cattle last sale.

The only heavy steers in the offering sold to a feedlot at dearer rates. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, while the cow market was firm to 2c/kg dearer. An increased number of bulls also sold to a dearer trend."
"There was a rain reduced penning of 460 mostly good quality cattle, although there was an increase in cow and weaner steer numbers. Most averages saw an upward trend, but the highest price in most grades was firm to slightly cheaper. Most operators and restockers were active.

Interest was centred on feeder steers and steer weaners, with the yearlings showing better averages in the secondary lines. Yearling heifers were quite a bit dearer than last week.

There were no numbers of grown steers to quote, grown heifers were dearer by 6c to 8c/kg. Cows prices were generally firm on last sale."
"There was a rain affected yarding of cattle with a reduction in numbers for most classes of cattle. Vealers and yearlings were well supplied, while cows dominated the grown cattle section. Quality of the young cattle was very mixed with several pens of well finished yearlings, especially heifers, while there was some good runs of well-bred cattle suitable for feeder and restocker buyers, however there was some plain conditioned cattle through the sale.

Competition was much keener for most young cattle with restocker and feeder activity very strong, acquiring the largest percentage of vealers and yearlings, with the exception of the well finished trade cattle. Restocker vealer steers were up by 6c selling to a top of 305.2c/kg. Trade yearling steers topped at 256c, while feeder and restocker yearling steers were up by 5c to 10c, reaching a top of 287/kg. Trade yearling heifers were 20c dearer with medium weights selling from 229c to 268c, while heavy milk tooth heifers sold to a top of 272c/kg.

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows, along with a few pens of heifers. Grown heifers sold to a top of 257c, while the cow market was 4c dearer for the medium weights to average around 184c, and heavy cows gained 13c to top at 215.2c/kg."
"There was a quite remarkable drop in the average condition of the yarding, following a run of heavy frosts and variable daytime temperatures. It was obvious that most cattle had lost body weight to a considerable degree. The bulk of the yarding was cows and heifers and it appears that the large runs of weaner cattle being yarded have come to a sudden halt.

All regular buyers attended the sale together with increasing numbers of mainly local growers keen to buy lightweight replacement cattle before spring, even though pasture conditions are far from ideal. Most pens of feeder heifers were 4c/kg cheaper, but the balance of the young cattle yarding sold at firm rates considering the drop in weight and condition. Demand for trade cattle was very strong but there were very few suitable cattle available. 

The young bullocks yarded were not high yielding cattle but they sold at firm prices. A few pens of quality older heifers sold steadily as did medium and heavy cows. A number of pens of lightweight cows attracted restocker competition to sell at slightly higher prices. Feeder steers were not in great numbers but the price was firm. Bull prices were marginally higher.

Top sale of the day was 218.2c/kg paid by a restocker for very light steer vealers."
"There was a plain yarding both for condition and breed quality. The bulk of the yarding were two score yearlings with both sexes sharing the numbers. There are very few true vealers left to sell at this time of year. There were a few pens of better finished bullocks and a greater number of cows most of which were medium weights. Bulls were in very much greater numbers.

The same buyers attended and the trend in the market was firm or cheaper. Some very light splitter veal sold at firm rates though as they got heavier the rate fell back. Yearling heifers were very light in weight and the lightest sold firm while the heaviest sold at cheaper prices. Feeder steers were plain condition and they and the restocker yearling steers sold at firm prices. There was only one pen of  C3 trade steers yarded.

There were only a few pens of bullocks available and as there were none yarded last week the firm quote must apply to that sale of a fortnight ago. Cows sold strongly at fully firm prices as did the good numbers of bulls."
"There was a plain quality yarding, but it was a little better than last weeks sale, however fat young cattle are still scarce. The usual number of operators bid on the fat stock, but restock demand was much weaker, particularily on light yearlings. 

Last sales extreme values for very light cattle to restock were not repeated, and the average fall on these types was in the vicinity of 10 cents per kilogram. Trade cattle on the other hand were 3 cents dearer.

There were few export cattle yarded, but values were fully maintained for these descriptions. Bulls were yarded in extraordinary numbers, considering the size of the yarding."
"There was a percentage of better quality cattle yarded, but there was still a high number of lighter conditioned cattle. As has become the regular pattern, cows were in the greatest numbers followed by weaners and plain yearlings. There were a few pens of quality bullocks available, but trade cattle were very poorly supplied as were the restocker steers and feeder steers.

The trends in the market for young cattle were difficult to follow with the best steer weaners to restockers selling to a considerably cheaper market. There were exceptions on three pens of stylish weaners that sold to a slightly dearer trend to a special order. The light and plainer steer weaners sold at marginally dearer rates to restockers. Heifer weaners and vealers were dearer while trade cattle showed little change.

The bullocks sold very strongly under a very keen demand but a quote is difficult as there have been none yarded in the past two sales. There was a genuine variety in the market trends with cows. All slaughter cows sold to a cheaper market, but the light restocker cows were slightly dearer. The heavier type of restocker cow was cheaper in the over 400kg weight category. The bull market again lost some value.

The top sale price was 215.2c/kg paid for heavily muscled steer weaners bought by a restocker."
"There was a much smaller offering to start sales in the new financial year. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering with quality mixed. The condition of the yarding was on the plain side with finished cattle in limited numbers. All regular buyers were in attendance and restocker competition was good.

The market showed varying trends with steer vealers to the restockers selling to a cheaper trend with an isolated sale of lightweights dearer by quite a bit. Heifer vealers to restock sold firm to slightly dearer with those to processors firm. Yearling steers to restock and feed in greater numbers sold firm to dearer with the inclusion of the fully weaned steers. Heifer yearlings sold up to 5c/kg dearer to both the trade and restockers.

There were insufficient heavy steers to quote with the quality fairly plain. Grown heifers generally sold at firm rates while the cow market realised a cheaper trend, down 3c to 5c/kg."
"There was a much bigger yarding and an improvement in the average quality. Most of the cattle yarded were carrying more condition and the breed quality was better. There were big numbers of restocker yearling steers available, some good lines in quality cows and some bigger pens of lightweight yearling heifers. There were no finished bullocks yarded but there were a few lines of heavier steers.

The usual buyers attended together with an increased presence of local restocker buyer following some weeks of beneficial rain. Restocker yearling steers were very much in demand and sold to a dearer trend while the heifer portion was fully firm in price. Trade heifers were light supplied but they sold at fully firm rates. There were only a few pens of vealers in the yarding and most were bought by restockers. 

There were no bullocks to quote but the few heavy steers sold at firm rates. Export weight heifers were dearer under a strong demand and most of the better cows in the offering sold at firm prices as did the few bulls."
"There was a minor improvement in quality but the numbers remained restricted and they are not likely to improve too much in the near future.  Some very good lines of cows were yarded, all of which were suitable for restocking.  Yearling heifers, both trade weights and restockers, were in fair numbers.  Steers were short supplied and the export cows were of fair quality with most off oat crops.  There were no bullocks, feeder steers or vealers yarded.

Restocker demand was again very strong and the market trend in young cattle was steady or dearer.  The few steer weaners and yearlings were dearer as were the heifer yearlings, the bulk of which were bought by restocker to fatten or to feed on.  The limited number of trade weight heifers yarded was cheaper under less competition from the trade.

Restocker cows were in numbers and sold strongly to a fully firm market.  Export heifer prices were steady but no other export suitable cattle were available."
"There was a lot less competition in front of a slightly reduced penning. Both young cattle and grown cattle were evenly represented with a great variation in quality and condition. Differing from the previous sale was the lack of good quality straight lines. The regular processors were in attendance with the reduced attendance coming from the large field of feedlot and restockers present at the previous sale.

Trends were cheaper through all classes of young cattle with a fortnight of falling markets contributing to some large price changes.there was also quality related change. Crossbred yearling steers heading to Northern paddocks and feed yards held up reasonably well. In a falling market the secondary quality yearling heifers attracted some of the larger price corrections.

Despite all being in attendance processor demand was weaker through all classes of grown cattle with the well finished heavy steers down by 16c to 20c/kg. The well finished grown heifers were less affected. Cows and bulls felt the brunt of the cheaper market with the well finished heavy weights as much as 35c/kg cheaper while the plainer conditioned cows experienced greater falls. Heavy bulls were also significantly cheaper with falls in excess of those of the cows."
"There was a light yarding of cattle although quality improved this week with some better types of feeder steers, a few pens of well finished grown steers and some good heavy cows through the sale. The yearling heifer were in lighter numbers.

The market was again stronger for all classes of cattle with all the yearling steers going to restockers and feeders.  Best of the yearling heifers were 2c/kg dearer and more in places and the light plainer types made the greatest gains.

The yarding of export cattle was down in numbers however the market was dearer with steers 6c/kg dearer.  There was only an odd line of cows sold with most being sold in single lots and gaining 5c to 6c/kg.  The heavier yarding of bulls consisted of some high yielding types that attracted keener competition.

Top price of the sale was for light weight veal at 256.2c/kg."
"There was a larger offering of fair to good quality cattle penned, with increased supplies of vealers and well finished yearling heifers. There were a fair number of yearling steers, while heavy grown steers were in numbers too small to quote. All regular buyers were in attendance for a strong market.

Vealers sold to levels not previously seen at this centre with supplies in the north and traditional vealer centres restricted due to flooding. Lightweight yearling steers experienced little change in the trend with the price variation due more to quality and weight than anything else. The medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, up 7c to 15c/kg. Lightweight yearling heifers to the trade sold to a dearer trend, up 20c to 30c, while those to restockers were the only category of young cattle to show a cheaper trend, down 5c/kg. Medium and heavy C3 trade heifers were 2c to 8c/kg dearer.

Grown steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend. Grown heifers also dearer with the 2 tooth heifers improving significantly. The cow market was firm to 4c/kg dearer with the quality of the well finished medium and heavyweights also showing improvement. Bulls sold to a cheaper trend."
"There was a large penning of weaners for this late in the season, along with quite a few cows. Yearlings and grown cattle were in reduced numbers. Good lines of weaners suitable to restockers were available and this contributed to a lift in quality. There were a few well finished young cattle, however most of the condition was reserved for the grown cattle. The usual processors were in attendance and there was strong restocker competition for weaners. There is a reduction of feedlot and restocker competition for the small number of yearlings.

High demand and the improvement in quality saw weaners sell to a dearer trend, both steers and heifers of all weight ranges, this, despite some recent heavy frosts. The light and medium weight steers were as much as 18c/kg dearer. Similar weight heifer weaners to restock improved by as much as 28c/kg with quality contributing. There were strong gains in the well finished heifer vealers suitable to the domestic trade market. The limited supply of yearling steers and heifers attracted restricted competition and sold to cheaper trends throughout.

Well finished heavy grown steers and heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 5c/kg respectively. Demand for well finished heavy weight cows increased with the market trend up to 10c/kg dearer. The plainer condition and medium weight 3 and 4 scores sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Restockers were active in the market for plain condition cows and any that were joined. Strong competition and some very good quality bulls saw that market up to 6c/kg dearer."
"There was a large penning of vealers in an increased offering. Yearling numbers were down and there were very few well finished grown steers and heifers, while cows were well supplied. The quality of the yarding was very mixed with large numbers of lean young cattle. Conversely there were some very well finished vealers available. The regular buyers were in attendance and there was extra competition for steer weaners from the west.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with the extra restocker competition seeing light and medium weight steer vealers sell to a dearer trend, up by 2c to 14c/kg with the bigger price rise breed related. There was limited restocker competition for light and medium weight heifer vealers with that market trend considerably cheaper. Once again there were premiums paid for specific breeds. Feedlot competition limited price falls on the heavier heifers. An improvement in quality saw well finished heifer vealers to the trade sell to a dearer trend. The reduced supply of yearling steers suitable to feed sold to a cheaper trend. Heifer yearlings to feed improved in quality and sold to a dearer trend, up to 4c/kg on the medium weights and much more for heavyweights.

There were too few well finished grown steers and heifers to quote. The cow market sold to a cheaper trend with medium and heavyweights down by 1c to 5c/kg. The plainest condition cows experienced greater price falls with limited restocker competition."
"There was a large increase in numbers this week, consisting mostly of vealers and yearlings, with a fair supply of cows. The quality of the offering was very mixed, tending plainer. All of the regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market trended cheaper throughout, with secondary quality lots experiencing significant discounts. The good quality steer vealers to restock were down 2c to 3c/kg, these being the sought after breeds. Secondary quality and the less attractive breeds experienced greater falls. Heifer vealers to both the trade and restockers eased by 3c to 15c/kg, with weaker demand from processors in the face of increasing supplies. A very mixed quality penning of yearling steers saw trends for the better quality lines firm to 3c cheaper, with the secondary grades more. Heifer yearlings were 6c to 16c cheaper with a mostly plain quality offering.

Heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend with prices down 1c to 6c/kg. The best prices were reserved for high yielding lots. The cow market saw a large correction with the trend 9c to 14c cheaper. Very plain condition and a few overdone lots experienced greater falls."
"There was a halving of numbers with cows and vealers making up the bulk of the offering. There were limited supplies of yearlings and grown cattle. The quality and condition was very mixed. There were some very well presented vealers along with a few well finished yearlings. Cows varied from very plain through to some high quality, high yielding heavyweights. The usual buyers were in attendance, along with extra restocker competition. There was a different live export order operating on heavy bulls.

Both competition and demand was very high through the vealers with both restockers and processors competing strongly. This resulted in dearer trends. Steer vealers returning to the paddock saw a trend that was upwards of 50c/kg dearer, more in places with a quality related component also. There were similar trends through the heifer portion and more, particularly those vealers to processors. Yearling steers to restock and feed were quite mixed in quality, they saw a dearer trend of up to 35c/kg. The better quality heifer portion experienced a similar trend. The plainer quality and condition heifers saw a vastly improved market trend.

There was an increased supply of well finished grown heifers, they attracted strong demand from processors. Little from last week to make a comparison. Restockers were active on the plainer grown heifers with that market showing significant improvement. The cow market was 20c/kg dearer and more in places for the well finished medium and heavyweights as processors competed strongly to secure requirements. The plainer condition cows experienced strong gains also. That live export order pushed the bull market to a much dearer trend, however those purchased by processors experienced a moderate price rise."
"There was a greatly reduced penning this week. It was a mostly plain quality and condition penning that saw quite a few grown heifers penned. There were limited supplies of good quality forward condition young cattle available. The condition of the cows was also on the plainer end of the scale, with limited numbers of well finished cows penned. The usual buyers attended.

Market trends through the young cattle were mostly dearer. Steer vealers to restock saw breed contribute to some significant price change to the positive. An improved quality penning of heifer vealers suitable to the trade sold to a dearer trend of as much as 35c/kg. There were a small number of very well finished vealers suitable to the local butchers that attracted very strong competition, lifting prices sharply. Heifer vealers to restock and feed also sold to dearer trends, however improvement was not as great. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers attracted less competition and sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, with both breed and quality affecting price change.

Breed was a major factor in significant price improvements through the plain condition grown heifers. Well finished grown heifers to processors, in limited numbers sold to a dearer trend, up to 8c/kg. There was increased restocker competition on the plain condition cows. This resulted in the 1 and 2 scores going to dearer trends. The plainest condition cows saw higher price gains. Well finished cows to processors sold to a cheaper trend, easing 5c/kg. There was a good supply of bulls penned with both processors and live exporters active, as market trends were firm to slightly dearer."
"There was a good yarding of cattle consisting of a fair number of vealers, while yearlings were well supplied and cows dominated the grown cattle section. Quality of the young cattle was mixed with the largest percentage of steers and heifers suitable for feeders and restockers, with only an odd pen that was suitable for the trade. There were some good runs of well-bred cattle that attracted keen competition from feeder and restocker buyers.

Prices were compared to the sale two weeks ago. Restocker vealer steers toped at 209.2c, while vealer heifers to slaughter were up to 20c dearer toping at 184c/kg. There was large numbers of Angus steers that went to feeders and back grounders at prices that were 5c to 10c/kg above the previous sale. Most steers ranged from 180c to 222.2c/kg. Feeder heifers were 10c dearer and up to 20c dearer for light weights selling to a top of 200c/kg. Trade yearling steers toped at 198c and the heifers sold to 180c/kg. 

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows, along with a small penning of grown steers and heifers. Grown steers were 10c dearer selling to 194.2c and heifers gained 5c selling to 183.2c/kg. Medium and heavy cows struggled to hold firm, while 2 score cows were 5c/kg dearer."
"There was a good quality offering with a small increase in numbers. Young cattle were well supplied and there was a very good quality offering of heavy steers and cows, all of which were in fair numbers. All regular buyers were in attendance with good restocker and feedlot competition.

The young cattle market was strong through all grades with trade vealers selling firm. Vealer steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend, up 6c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed were very strong through all weight classes and sold up to 10c/kg dearer. The majority of the yearling heifers were well sought by all sectors to sell to a dearer trend, up 3c/kg. There was an odd pen of plainer quality heifer yearlings that struggled to maintain their rate.

The improved quality of the heavy steers and bullocks contributed to the dearer market, the trend was up by 7c/kg. There were some very good grown heifers on offer with the market also showing a dearer trend. The cow market was 3c/kg dearer throughout, with a good line up of high yielding cows penned. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend with yields increased."
"There was a good increase in numbers with the quality of the offering fair to good. There was an increased supply of well finished cattle. Yearling heifers were well supplied and there were some very good cows penned. A full field of buyers were in attendance with strong orders and restockers were active. This contributed to a very strong market with most grades showing improvement.

Vealers sold to a dearer trend, up 1c to 15c/kg to processors and restockers who competed strongly for both lightweight steers and heifers. Yearling steers to restock and feed met high demand to show improvement of 9c to 20c/kg through all weight classes. The increased competition saw heifer yearlings to restockers sell to a dearer trend, up 15c to 20c/kg. The medium weight C3 heifers to the trade also sold dearer, however the heavyweights eased.

There were some very good heavy steers penned with the market showing a dearer trend. The best rates were for milk and 2 tooth cattle. Restockers and feeders were active on plainer condition steers with rates improving. Grown heifers also sold to a dearer trend. The increased numbers and quality of the offering saw the well finished cows show significant price improvements. Restockers were active on the plain condition cows with rates dearer. Heavy bulls also sold to dearer trend."
"There was a further reduction in numbers. Vealers were in reduced supply, while yearlings and cows made up the bulk of the offering. The quality of the penning was very mixed and tending to plain. There were some handy yearlings suitable to the restockers and some good cows. There were a number of pens of cow/calf units as well as splitter calves in the face of poor seasonal conditions. Not all regular processors were in attendance.

The market trend for vealers was firm to cheaper. There was little but quality related price changes for yearling steers to restock and feed. Yearling heifers were firm to cheaper with the better quality lots least affected. Once again quality played a big part in price change.

A small but much improved quality penning of heavy steers sold at dearer prices. There was little but quality related change in the cow market."
"There was a further reduction in numbers, with vealers and cows well supplied. There were limited numbers through the other categories. The quality of the offering was mixed, with good quality light and medium weight vealers along with large numbers of plain condition cows. There were a small number of well finished vealers, yearlings and cows penned. Once again, export processor competition was restricted, however there was increased restocker activity for vealers and plain condition cows.

Light and medium weight vealer steers attracted solid demand from restockers, selling firm to slightly dearer. Vealer steers weighing over 280kg saw reduced competition and sold a little cheaper, down 2c/kg. There was stronger competition from both restockers and trade buyers for heifer vealers, with a dearer market trend resulting. Strong gains in some classes with the 3 score trade vealers up to 22c/kg dearer. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend with very few good quality lots penned. Well finished trade yearling heifers sold firm to 3c/kg dearer, with the plainer lots selling to a cheaper trend.

Grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, with very few heavy weights available to processors. There was increased demand from restockers for plain condition cows, with more buyers operating. Dearer trends resulted with gains of 15c to 16c/kg, and more in places. The increased restocker activity also lifted prices for plain cows to process. Limited demand for well finished cows resulted in cheaper trends, down 9c to 15c/kg."
"There was a further reduction in numbers, with quite a few cows and a reduced supply of weaners. There were reduced supplies in all other categories. The quality of the offering was mixed as was condition. There was increased processor competition with a noticeable absentee from last week returning. There was a larger gallery of restocker buyers in attendance.

Weaner steers to restock saw a mostly firm market trend, with odd sales cheaper and some a little dearer. Breed and quality were a factor in quite a large price range. The light and medium weight heifer weaners to restock sold to a cheaper trend, while the heavier weights remained firm. The limited supply of medium and heavy weight yearling steers sold to a dearer trend with increased competition. Yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend with reduced supply.

A small number of heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend, up to 5c/kg. Demand and competition increased for cows from both processors and restockers. Market trends were 10c to 20c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls also sold to a slightly dearer trend."
"There was a further reduction in numbers, not uncommon at this time of the year. Most categories were represented with the quality of the offering very mixed. There were a few young cattle showing the benefit of crop and some well finished cows. The usual processors were in attendance. There was increased restocker and feedlot competition for steers and less competition for heifers.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with steer vealers to restock selling firm to cheaper. Heifer vealers to restock sold to a dearer trend with an improvement in quality. Those to the trade also sold to a dearer trend. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, with medium weight feeders up to 6c/kg dearer. Yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend with a drop in the overall quality of the offering contributing to price changes.

The quality of the grown heifers was plain with restockers active on a dearer market trend. The cow market saw dearer trends with extra competition on the plainer condition cows. Overall trends were 10c to 16c/kg dearer. Stronger competition for bulls saw the market much dearer than the previous week."
"There was a further reduction in numbers, however this is not unusual at this time of the year as vendors look forward to the onset of spring. Young cattle, cows and bulls made up the bulk of the offering. There was limited processor competition, with increased restocker activity. The quality of the offering was mixed and well finished cattle were in short supply.

There were varying trends through the young cattle and quality contributed to some significant price variations either way. Steer weaners to restock sold to a cheaper trend for a plainer quality penning. The trend was firm for heifer vealers to both the trade and restockers. There was a great deal of variation in the quality of the yearling steers to restock and feed with the good quality steers selling to a dearer trend. There was little change on the secondary quality steers. Yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend under increased competition from restockers.

There was little change in the market for the few heavy grown steers. Cows and bulls sold to a dearer trend with cows up by 5c to 10c/kg. Heavy bulls attracted spirited bidding from a limited buying group to show increases of as much as 40c/kg."
"There was a further reduction in numbers, for what was a very mixed quality penning. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering, although bulls accounted for around 10%. The young cattle varied from very plain lightweights through to a couple of pens of good quality medium weight yearling steers, with most cattle in condition best suited to restocker orders.

With spring just around the corner and the forecast for rain this weekend, restocker confidence was boosted. Dearer trends were seen through all classes of young cattle returning to the paddock. There was, however, some quality related price changes.

There were a small number of cows penned, with most presenting on the leaner side. Restockers were active on lightweights showing a decent frame, with dearer prices resulting. Two extra buyers in the bull market helped to lift prices by 30c to 40c/kg."
"There was a further reduction in numbers, down to 715 head. This was the lowest autumn number for this selling centre that can be remembered. The quality was very mixed throughout with the majority of the cattle in plainer condition. The usual buyers were in attendance; however demand was much weaker for the plainer condition cattle.

Market trends were generally cheaper through the young cattle as restocker demand wanes with the prospect of going into winter with little feed or water. Steer vealers to restock saw a market trend up to 20c/kg cheaper. The heifer portion was as much as 25c/kg cheaper. The few well finished 3 scores to the trade were slightly dearer, up to 7c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend of 12c to 23c/kg with very few good quality lots available. Yearling heifers to feed were less affected, down 8c/kg.

There were no good quality heavy grown steers to quote. A very plain quality and condition penning of grown steers sold reasonably well, with premiums for 2 teeth heifers and large discounts for those carrying 6 teeth. Plain condition cows sold to a cheaper trend of 5c/kg. The well finished heavy weight cows sold to a dearer trend with quality also improving."
"There was a further reduction in numbers, as the progeny of last year run out and producers prepare for next yearâ€™s offspring. The quality of the offering was quite mixed, with a few well finished heifers and cows. For the most part, the cattle looked like the end of production. There was a limited buying group in attendance. Due to the low numbers, after next week, the centre will be holding sales on a fortnightly basis until further notice.

There were not really enough cattle in each category for a quote on market trends. Medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed saw price improvements. Yearling heifers to restock and feed were cheaper with limited competition.

Grown heifers sold to cheaper trends, with limited supplies of well finished lots. Cows also sold to cheaper trends, with limited supplies to satisfy processor requirements, while some very good quality bulls sold to a slightly cheaper trend."
"There was a further reduction in numbers and vealers, yearlings and cows made up the bulk of the offering. Quality was mixed throughout, with some very good quality cattle penned. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance and there was an extra buyer in the market operating on high quality heifers. Trends varied throughout.

Light weight vealer steers to restock were 20c to 30c/kg cheaper, however quality was a major factor in the price fall. Medium and heavy vealers to restock remained firm with some quality related price change. The C muscle yearling steers to restock and feed under 330kg mostly sold to a cheaper trend, although an improvement in average quality lifted prices in one weight range. Breed quality contributed to significant price change on the lightweight D muscles. Medium and heavy yearling steers attracted strong competition from both restocker and feeder orders to record a dearer trend of 6c to 9c/kg. The market trend for heifer yearlings to restock and feed was firm to dearer, with breed quality again lifting some prices significantly. An outstanding quality line of heavy heifers attracted strong support from both feeder and processor orders.

There were no heavy grown steers to quote. Grown heifers to processors sold to a cheaper trend. Restockers were active in the cow market, with the trend for plain condition cows returning to the paddock dearer. Well finished cows to process sold to a cheaper trend, with heavy weights down 7c to 9c/kg. Heavy bulls were as much as 10c/kg cheaper."
"There was a further increase in numbers, with cows and vealers making up the bulk of the offering. There was a fair supply of yearlings, mostly in the lighter weight classes. The quality of the offering was very mixed, with some very well bred lines of vealers, but conversely quite a few secondary and plain quality lots. Condition throughout varied greatly, from very plain through to some cows showing no effect from the conditions of the season. The usual buyers attended.

Demand from restockers was weaker, while feed lotters struggled to find sufficient numbers of cattle within specifications. Market trends through the vealers to both restock and the trade were cheaper. Secondary quality cattle in both the steers and heifers were most affected. The good quality steers to restockers were up to 8c/kg cheaper, however an isolated sale of very good quality steers achieved a dearer price. A very mixed quality penning of yearling steers saw light weights sell to a much cheaper trend. The medium and heavy feeders sold firm, with the odd quality related dearer sale. Light weight yearling heifers saw odd sales slightly dearer, however the plainer quality heifers sold to cheaper trends. The cheaper trend was also evident in medium weight feeders.

Too few well finished grown steers and heifers for a market quote. The large volume of cows met subdued competition from processors. The better conditioned cows experienced the greatest decreases. There was more competition for the plainer condition cows from processors, with the better end of those cows only slightly cheaper. The plainest of the cows were much cheaper."
"There was a further increase in numbers with young cattle suitable to restock and feed plentiful. Well finished young cattle suitable to the trade were in limited supply. Cows made up the bulk of the export cattle. The overall quality of the offering was fair to good with quite a few still showing the effects of the poor seasonal conditions through last year. The usual processor orders were in place however there was a little less feedlot competition.

Varying trends were evident through the young cattle to restock and feed with the better quality light and medium weight steer vealers to restock selling to a cheaper trend. There were some very strong sales in the plain condition lightweights with breed quality having a major impact on price variation. Heifer vealers to restock followed a similar trend to that of the steers. Vealers to the trade sold to a cheaper trend down 10c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend with the light and medium weights most affected. Quality also played a part in cheaper prices. Heavy feeder steers were least affected, down 4c/kg. Yearling heifers to restock and feed could not sustain the high levels of the previous sale with market trend 6c to 20c/kg cheaper. Well finished medium and heavy heifers to the trade were also as much as 20c/kg cheaper.

There was a limited number of well finished heavy steers sold to processors with the market trend dearer. A lift in average quality saw prices improve by as much as 9c/kg. Grown steers to feed sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Well finished grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend, down as much as 20c/kg on a plainer quality offering. The cow market also experienced cheaper trends with the well finished medium and heavy weights least affected. Plain condition light and medium weights saw the greatest price falls with quality impacting. The better medium and heavyweights were down 9c to 10c/kg."
"There was a further increase in numbers with young cattle and cows well supplied. No well finished heavy grown steers were penned, however there were a number of pens of older feeder steers. Well finished grown heifers were in limited numbers. The quality of the offering was mixed, featuring some very good young cattle suitable to restockers and feedlotters. The condition of the offering was also mixed, however there were limited numbers of well finished young cattle. Less than a full field of buyers were in attendance with both processors and feedlots absent.

The reduced competition from feedlotters had little effect on the market for young cattle with market trends for vealers and yearlings mostly dearer for the good quality cattle. Vealer steers to restock were up to 3c/kg dearer. Heifer vealers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend of as much as 8c/kg. Lightweight yearling steers to restock were dearer, while medium and heavyweights to feed were 12c to 15c/kg dearer. Heifer yearlings to feed sold to a dearer trend with prices improving by as much as 20c/kg for medium weights. The quality of those heifers also improved. Similar weight heifers returning to the paddock sold to a cheaper trend with a drop in quality also. Secondary quality yearlings met with restricted competition and demand to sell to a cheaper trend.

The reduced processor competition impacted heavy grown cattle with heifers selling to a cheaper trend. The cow market was up to 20c/kg cheaper for those to process. There were some strong restocker orders in place for an improved penning of plainer condition cows with the market showing a dearer trend of 5c to 10c/kg."
"There was a further increase in numbers as producers continue to take advantage of the current market level rather than the option to improve the condition of stock on hand. The overall quality of the offering was very mixed and there were limited supplies of well finished cattle available to processors. Coming out of a tough winter, condition was generally on the plain side. There were, however, some very good condition milk vealers and crop finished heifers and cows. The same processor and restocker orders were in place.

The young cattle section of the sale saw a great variation in quality, weight and condition. Cheaper trends were evident in most cases, with some exceptions. The mixed quality of the offering also played a large role in price change. Both vealer and yearling steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 15c to 16c/kg, and more in places. Light weight yearling heifers also sold to a cheaper trend in most cases, the exception being the plainest condition lots to restockers, which were dearer. The well-finished medium and heavy heifer yearlings attracted increased feedlot competition, however no comparison from last sale was available.

There were too few heavy grown steers for a quote. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 5c to 7c/kg. The cow market suffered some of the largest falls, down 16c to 30c/kg, with both processors and restockers much more subdued. The bull market continued its recent upward trend, lifting 15c to 30c/kg on a fairly plain quality penning."
"There was a fair improvement in the quality on most categories, with the bulk of the yarding being heifer veal and yearling heifers. There were some numbers of high yield cows available compared to last sale, but only a few pens of male cattle on offer. This week all the regular buying strength competed.

Heifer vealers and yearlings to slaughter sold between 2c and 6c/kg dearer, with the demand much more concentrated. Yearling steers sold to a cheaper trend due to restockers running against recent trends.

Demand for all export cattle was strong with the few steers over 500kg selling at firm rates. Cows were in demand and sold to an average of 5c to 6c/kg dearer with the better yields available having been taken into account."
"There was a decrease in numbers, despite a few dry days in the lead up. Quality was mixed with most grades represented. There was a fair supply of young cattle with cows and grown heifers also in reasonable numbers, heavy grown steers were in limited supply. All regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market was solid however quality variations played a major role in price changes. There was an increased supply of milk vealers and they sold very well both to the processors and restockers. Yearling steers to restock and feed lost the gains of last week due to a drop in quality, with the market trend close to firm. A small number of heavy yearling steers sold to a dearer trend. It was the same for heifer yearlings to restock with the trend near enough to firm with quality accounting for most price change. The well finished trade yearling heifers sold quite a bit dearer although supplies were limited. 

Grown steers to feed sold to a dearer trend with the average quality also showing an improvement. Well finished grown heifers sold firm to 4c/kg dearer. Plainer quality light conditioned heifers were cheaper. The cow market was firm to 3c/kg dearer with a strong restocker presence."
"There was a considerable downward trend in the quality of the cows in the yarding while steer weaners averaged more weight than the last sale. Heifer vealers were in fair numbers but there are signs that they are weaning and therefore they have a dryer look in the coat. Heavy steers and bullocks were not in any numbers while the quality of the yearlings left something to be desired. Feeder steers were in less numbers than last sale but their quality was up to standard generally.

There was a weakening market for most descriptions as the winter season deepens. The restock demand has diminished, as it often does at this time of year. Good rain would probably halt the cheapening trend that we are experiencing. Steer weaners sold to a reducing market with the numbers in the last month seeming to be taking the edge off the demand. Heifer vealers to slaughter were slightly easier due to the heavy supply. All the yearling steers went to feedlots or restockers and that demand is fairly stable. Trade heifers were few and their values stayed close to firm for the best but was marginally weaker for plainer lots.

The heavy steers and bullocks showed just a slight weakening in price but there was not a lot of yield evident in the offering. The cows made up 25% of the yarding again and the majority were older plainer types. That oversupply was responsible for a drop in values and the lack of restocker competition had a marked affect also. Even the better cows were easier in price but there were very few yielding cows in the whole yarding. The ending of the weaner selling season will probably see a drop in the numbers of cows available as most are culled following the sale of their calves in late autumn and early winter."
"There was a big drop in vealer numbers, making up the majority of the fall in numbers. Once again vealers, cows and yearlings made up the bulk of the offering. Overall the quality was fair to good although vealer quality dropped a little. All regular buyers were in attendance and operating.

The young cattle market was generally good with exception being Vealer steers to restockers and the plain quality yearling cattle. Vealer steers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend, down 6c to 8c/kg on the sale a fortnight ago. Heifer vealers to processors were well sought, particularly the light weights, they sold to a dearer trend, up 15c to 20c/kg Medium and heavy heifer vealers to the trade sold firm to 8c dearer while those to feedlots sold firm to 5c/kg cheaper.

There were few well finished yearling cattle in the offered. Most steers went to restockers and feedlot orders at rates firm to 6c dearer than the last sale. Heifer yearlings saw the best quality grades firm, plainer quality grades selling to a cheaper trend.

There were very few well finished heavy steers offered, the market firm to slightly dearer. A good selection of cows in all weight and condition ranges met keen demand with the market showing a dearer trend, up 4c to 6c/kg."
"There was a  better quality yarding of yearling cattle off oat crops, in a total of 695 head. There were a few pens of fair to good heavy steers and light bullocks, but vealers were in low numbers, and the cows didn't reach last sale standards for quality.                                  
With numbers decreasing in the Northern areas, the market for all the better finished cattle in particular, is strenghthening. This sale was no exception. Bullocks are in much stronger demand and have been dearer each week, as are the well covered trade cattle, heavy bulls, and the export feeder steers,. The cows, however showed little change this week due to a drop in quality."
"There has been no sale in Armidale since December 17th. This report compares with that sale.

Trade cattle were very short supplied, but bullocks and cows were yarded in fair numbers and were of excellent quality. The usual regular buyers attended the sale. It is still too early in the season for any numbers of genuine veal to be yarded.

Most trade cattle sold at firm rates, but restocker yearling steers were 3 c/kg cheaper.

Bullocks were met a strong enquiry.  There have been very few of these types of cattle yarded recently in Armidale, but the prices received were similar to those in adjacent saleyards.

The cow market continues at the consistent levels from pre Christmas,  with just a slight sign of weakening in odd sales.

The bull market is weakening slightly, with prices 3 c/kg cheaper than before the break."
"The yardng  was  smaller by 240 head for a total of 405 cattle. Quality was well below last sale, but even so the market for all types was cheaper, in keeping with the recent trend. The majority of the yarding were cows and light restock yearling steers and heifers which met a weaker demand to be 4 to 6 cents cheaper. It should be noted that approximately 50% of the falls in value shown can be attributed to the considerable drop in the quality of most descriptions."
"The yardings continued with small numbers, a normal situation in New England at this time of year. Not a lot of quality cattle for the buyers to pick from,  other than a number of pens of excellent young,  high yielding cows, and export weight heifers. Yearling trade cattle were very short in numbers,  as were heavy steers and bullocks.

The market for the few yearlings to slaughter, or to restock, was unchanged, even though the demand exceeded supply.

Cows sold at firm to slightly dearer rate, with a heavy percentage of a perceived rise,  attributed to the much better product on offer.  The heavy heifers to export, however,  sold at an improved set of values."
"The yardings are falling back in numbers each week, as mid-winter approaches. The quality was similar to the last sale, but there were pens of well finished cattle scattered throughout. Cows, again, made up one third of the total, with weaners totalling a fair percentage, also. The usual operators were in attendance.

The stronger enquiry for restock steer weaners and yearling steers, was a feature of the sale, with these cattle well supplied. Price increases on all young cattle under two years, varied between 2c and 5c/kg, with a 3c average rise across the board.

Heavy steers and bullocks showed little change, though the quality was fair only.

There are cattle in the market that are, obviously slipping in condition, as the winter feed reduces, and the cold weather becomes even more severe.

There were not as many high yield cows available, but all weights and fat scores sold at firm rates, under a very consistent enquiry."
"The yardings are expected to get even smaller in August and September with growers choosing to hold some young cattle to value add for next season. The severe winter has dropped condition off most young stock and fat stock are mainly seen only in the older cattle. Yearling steers and weaners were the bulk of the yarding and their breed quality was quite respectable while there were a few small pens of good heavy steers and light bullocks. There were probably no more than 20 cows in the whole yard.

There was continuing strength in the market for the light splitter heifer vealers and yearlings with quite considerable price increases recorded. Weaner and yearling steers to restock sold well again with the weaners fully firm on last sale rates. The yearling steers sold at quite well improved prices. Trade cattle were few but they sold at firm prices.

The few bullocks available sold at fully firm rates while the cows showed little change on the very average selection available. There were not enough bulls yarded for a market quote."
"The yardings are decreasing weekly but the quality seems to be maintained on most of the yarding. The bulk of the cattle were vealers or yearlings with some crop fed steers and bullocks and a fair number of cows of a lesser quality than last week.

The numbers of young cattle buyers were down slightly but it did not affect the market to any extent. All the young cattle from light vealers through to the heavier yearling trade cattle stayed at fully firm rates and the solid market carried through to the store steers also.

There have been a number of high yielding cows offered recently but they were not available this week. The market for the cows however held firm with demand again very keen.  The lighter cows were snapped up by store buyers trying to hold back the recent rapid growth of grain crops. There were a number of bullocks over 500 kgs yarded and in keeping with the overall market trend they sold to a firm and consistent market."
"The yarding was well down in the average quality as the colder weather is starting to strip some condition off all but a few cattle. There were over 1000 cows included in the yarding of which 250 were sold at open auction to restockers. There were many less weaner cattle available as that season draws to a close. The heavy steers and bullocks were two and three score cattle with no four score cattle yarded for the first time for months. Restocker cattle apart from cows were in the majority and trade weight cattle were hard to find.

The general drift of the market across almost all descriptions was cheaper with many types losing very considerable price as the weather worsens. Restocker demand weakened for that reason and even though there were less quality steer weaners yarded the price dropped severely. The bright spot in the sale was in heifer vealers, which sold right up to last sale rates. Trade heifers also cheapened but quality was very plain.

The heavy steers and bullocks also sold at cheaper prices with the drop in quality having been taken into account in the quote. There was a variety of quotes in the cow market with some of the best cows losing 6c/kg from last weeks price while there were plenty of plainer pens where the price loss was over 10c/kg. The very few top bulls were firm but plainer and lighter cattle were cheaper.

The top price in the sale was 157.6c/kg paid for middle weight steer vealers to slaughter."
"The yarding was very mixed for quality with the bigger lines of cattle not evident this week. Weaners and vealers were in much smaller numbers indicating that the end of that season is in sight. Coinciding with the drop in vealer numbers was an increase in cow numbers, which is a regular occurrence at this time of the year.

Grown steers were in much increased numbers, but the quality was well back compared to earlier weeks. Yearling steers were well supplied, but again quality dropped and trade cattle are still in short supply.

One company usually buying heavy steers and cows was not competing, otherwise all the regular buyers attended. The market trend was firm or cheaper. The best quality steer weaners and the trade cattle were fully firm while all other weaners, vealers and plain steer yearlings were 3 c/kg cheaper.

The reduction in competition resulted in a 2c to 3 c/kg fall in the price of heavy steers and light bullocks to slaughter. This in turn caused a drop in some of the plainer types of grown restocker steers. A similar price fall was seen in most off type young cattle as well.

The success story of the day was in all grades of cows which sold on a fully firm market under some keen bidding."
"The yarding was the smallest for a number of years and was probably a true indication of the trend in the next few months. Yarding was mainly yearlings with a few pens of older bullocks and only a dozen cows. The average quality of the yarding was fair.

Restockers were very keen but were disappointed by the lack of numbers. Prices for all the young stock showed little alteration with yearlings to restock and heifers to feed, varying a little but the market quote remained firm.

The few cows, older bullocks and export weight heifers sold at unchanged rates as did the two pens only of plain quality older feeder steers."
"The yarding was slightly smaller,  but the quality was well below recent sales,  with few pens of fat cattle available. This is surprising in itself,  when the quality and quantity of feed is considered. The bulk of the yarding were plain yearlings and cows.

The market trend was cheaper,  almost across the spectrum of young cattle with the exception being the firm rates paid for restock steers.

Heavy steers and the light bullocks sold at last sale prices,  and in a few cases,  just a bit stronger. All cows and the bulls were at a lower value."
"The yarding was only small, but there were some fair quality cattle in all types, an improvement on last week s average quality. The bulk of the yarding were young cattle, mostly light weight. The usual regular Buyers operated.

The market was fairly regular, with little alteration in price on  young cattle, the improved quality having been taken into account. Restock demand for light cattle, continues to strengthen.

Cows sold to a strong market for the better yielding descriptions, but the bull market showed a weakening tendency. There was only one pen of genuine bullocks yarded, and they sold right up to recent Northern values."
"The yarding was one of very few selling centres to see an increase in numbers during the week. There was a good selection of vealers, cows and well finished yearling heifers, while there were limited numbers of heavy steers. Overall the quality of the offering was good with the condition variable. All regular buyers were in attendance and operating on a good market. All grades firm to dearer.

Vealer steers to restock sold firm. Heifer vealers to restock sold dearer, up 2c to 3c/kg with increased competition. Trade vealer heifers experienced little change for those to processors while the 3 scores to butchers sold slightly dearer. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold firm with the only price variation quality related. The highlight of the market were the well finished yearling heifers. Competition for these increased following very little competition last week and a much dearer market resulted, up 9c to 14c/kg. Yearling heifers to restockers and feeders remained firm.

The small number of heavy steers improved slightly for the quality improvement and sold to a dearer trend of 2c to 7c/kg. The plain condition cows sold to a dearer trend of 4c to 6c/kg while the well finished cows saw little change, with an odd better quality lot slightly dearer. The quality of the heavy bulls was plain and the market a little better."
"The yarding was once again in light condition with the breed quality well down on the previous sale. There were good numbers of yearling and two tooth feeder steers together with a limited number of cows, which varied from extremely light weights to well finished cattle. Weaners and yearlings made up the greatest percentage of the offering. Bullocks and heavy steers were short supplied and were mainly sold in single sales.

The greatest majority of the young cattle were bought by restockers under a very strong enquiry from mainly local growers. The trend in the market was either fully firm or dearer. Steer weaners and yearlings were fully firm as were the backgrounding steers and domestic feeder steers. Heifer weaners and yearlings varied up to an average price increase of 10c/kg with strong competition from both abattoirs and restockers. Trade heifers sold at firm rates for the few offered. 

No bullock or heavy steer quote is possible. Cows and export heifers sold at firm to slightly dearer values while the bull price was fully firm. Export feeder steers were in strong demand and sold at 6c/kg dearer."
"The yarding was mainly yearling cattle with 300 yearling steers offered, suitable for restocking, coming forward from a recently sold local property. There were also a number of pens of heavy steers and light to medium weight bullocks which were well finished, together with a number of pens of slightly older steers. Cows were in light supply but their quality was good, while the yearling heifers available were light in both bone and condition. Bull numbers were increased.

There was a strong and increased demand from restockers, mainly local, following some very good rain over the past three weeks. The better quality yearing steers were slightly dearer but the keenest enquiry was reserved for the very lightweight yearlings which were dearer by up to 25c/kg. There were no trade weight yearlings available.

Heavy steers and the bullocks, provided they were well covered, sold at dearer rates as did the plainer steers bought by restockers. There was little change in the price of cows or heavy heifers, and any percieved increase was the result of a better yield potential. Bull prices were cheaper."
"The yarding was equal in quality to last sale, but there was a much bigger percentage of cattle over two years and a shortage of young cattle. Cows were in fair numbers as were feeder steers and heavy steers and bullocks, but buyers were unable to obtain their requirements in vealer or trade cattle due to the drop in numbers available. There were reasonable numbers of light veal under 200kg yarded, but not as many as in recent weeks.

The same regular buyers attended the sale creating a market which varied between firm and cheaper. Light vealers were only just selling at firm rates. Yearling heifers on the plainer side were 3c and 4c/kg cheaper, but restocker and feeder yearling steers stayed at last sale levels. The numbers of restocker buyers has dropped, but some of the larger orders are keeping the market firm.

There was another strong market for all export cattle, except the heavy heifers which lost groung under reduced competition. The heavy steers and bullocks were unaltered for price and demand well maintained for the fairly good quality offering. The cows have been very consistent for price since the start of the new year with the comparative lack of numbers sustaining the market. Cows in store condition are hard to find as the season has layed on plenty of condition to most calf rearing cows. The demand from fatteners therefore continues to be very keen."
"The yarding was down only slightly, consisting of increased numbers of vealers, yearlings were well supplied and cows dominated the grown cattle.  Quality of the young cattle was very mixed with several pens of prime milk veal offered, along with some well bred yearlings suitable for feeders and restockers however, there was some plain condition cattle through the sale.

The market varied with vealers to slaughter selling 2c to 3c/kg dearer, while restocker vealer steers held firm. Few yearlings went to the trade with the largest percentage being acquired by feeders and restockers. Feeder and restocker yearling steers and heifers sold firm to cheaper with plainer conditioned suffering the greatest loss. 

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of cows with only a few pen of grown steers and grown heifers. The cow market varied with heavy weight cows 3c to 6c cheaper however, some price loss was quality related. Medium weights sold firm with the odd sales a little dearer, while 2 score cows held firm."
"The yarding was down considerably compared to the sale two weeks ago.  There was a large yarding of vealers, yearlings were well supplied, and there was a good yarding of grown cattle.  Quality of the young cattle was good with some good runs of outstanding heavy vealer steers and heifers and well bred yearlings.

A large percentage of the well bred vealer steers and heifers went to restockers and backgrounders, with a small number of vealer heifers destined for slaughter. Restocker vealer steers met keen demand selling 5c dearer and heifer portion was up by 6c to 10c dearer, while vealer heifers to slaughter were up by 6c/kg. Feeder steers sold firm to a dearer trend with the better bred cattle making the premium prices and feeder heifers were 4c/kg dearer.

The yarding of export cattle consisted of several pens of grown steers and heifers and a good yarding of cows.  Most of the cows were medium and heavy 3 and 4 scores.  Bullocks and steers were 4c/kg dearer, while heifers gained some ground.  The strong cow market improved for all grades with restockers competing hard for suitable store cows."
"The yarding was down by nearly 900 head consisting of a fair number of vealers, while yearlings made up a large percentage of the yarding and cows dominated the grown cattle section. Quality of the young cattle was fairly mixed with some good runs of well-bred vealer steers and yearlings suitable for feeders and restockers, along with a fair number of plain conditioned cattle.

The market varied considerably with well-bred vealer steers attracting keen restocker interest toping at 181c/kg, while the plainer steers struggled to hold firm. Restocker vealer heifers lost ground selling from 75c to 126c/kg. Well-bred yearling feeder steers sold firm to slightly dearer toping at 187c/kg for medium weights, while light steers were a little cheaper. Medium weight feeder heifers were slightly dearer selling to 160c/kg however, the trend throughout the sale was easier for the plain conditioned cattle.

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows along with a few pens of grown steers and heifers. Quality of the cows was mixed with several pens of well finished medium and heavy cow, however there was large numbers of plain 1 and 2 score cows offered. Grown steers and heifers held firm. The cow market varied with medium and heavy weights selling 2c to 3c/kg dearer. A large number of light 1 and 2 score cows went to restockers at firm to slightly cheaper prices."
"The yarding was both small and plain conditioned, with just a few pens of quality fat cattle. The bulk were store and yearling off cattle which are suitable for restocking. The usual meat buyers attended together with an increased number of restocker buyers.

Cows, as well as a few heavy steers and the yearling trade heifers were fully firm, but light yearlings to slaughter were up to 10c/kg dearer. Restocker cattle showed rises of up to 25c and averaged close to 15c/kg dearer under extremely strong demand."
"The yarding sizes are at consistent levels following recent rains but are expected to rise sharply closer to Easter.

Quality was again fairly plain with the bulk of the yarding taken up by light yearling heifers and restocker yearling steers. Cow and heavy steer numbers have fallen off in recent sales but their numbers may well increase in the coming weeks.

Restocker steer yearlings again demonstrated a strong demand and sold to a firm and solid market price. This market has been at the same level for weeks.

Light yearling heifers sold to  a much stronger enquiry to average a price improvement of 4c to 6c/kg. The better finished trade heifers did not alter. The light heifer market appears to indicate a considerable shortage of supply.

There were only just enough finished steers and bullocks available to quote a market .

The heavy high yield cow market was strong with the best yielding types rising in price under keen demand.

Bulls were much better types than last sale and this is indicated by the higher prices paid."
"The yarding sizes appear to be remaining steady on the run up to mid winter. There were some very good cattle available in yearlings from both a fat and a restocker viewpoint. The cow quality was high as most cows have fattened quickly since the rain earlier provided fresh feed. The heavy steers and bullocks were disappointing quality, while the weaners and vealers were mainly lighter weights. Feeder steers were in fair numbers as were the restocker steer yearlings, most of which are rising one year old at this time of the year.

The usual buyers attended the sale, and all were active to one degree or another. Most of the young cattle yarded met good competition and sold at fully firm rates either to slaughter or to restockers. Just a few pens of the best quality yearlings sold at marginally higher prices. The bulk of the restocker competition was from local growers. The younger feeder steers sold at firm rates provided they were best quality, but plainer and older types were cheaper by up to 10c/kg.

The export cattle again met less demand and most types lost considerable value on the day. The bullocks and heavy steers were cheaper by up to 10c/kg, but quality and yield were lacking. Cows were much cheaper as they have been on each of the last six weeks, and prices for light to medium yield cows varied between 8c and 14c/kg cheaper. There were some outstanding heavier cows yarded and they were cheaper by 6c to 8c/kg. The bull price did not vary from the previous sale.

The top sale price recorded was 200.8c/kg paid by a restocker for very light steer weaners.

Please note that cattle purchased by feedlots are now categorised within their respective age and sex categories. This data will now be represented on cattle reports by a FD precursor inside the respective age/sex section."
"The yarding size was maintained, with the quality improved both in breed and condition on the prime cattle. Some good lines of fat bullocks were yarded together with bigger lines of weaner steers and vealer heifers and some good runs of yearling steers. The percentage of cows yarded was unchanged and the quality was similar to the previous sale with very few high yield cows available.

There was a good field of buyers in attendance and the trend in young cattle was either fully firm or dearer. Steer weaners sold strongly to restockers with the improved quality creating a steady market price. Heifer vealers and weaners sold at dearer rates with keen bidding coming from restockers as well as wholesalers. As the quality improved through the sale, the prices for heifer vealers increased. A keen demand for yearling steers from restockers was responsible for a 3c to 4c/kg price rise.

There were a number of pens of quality bullocks yarded and these sold at firm rates with most ranging from two tooth to six tooth cattle. Cows sold steadily for all descriptions which included 250 PTIC cows and heifers offered as a clearance sale. These cows sold to $900 and the heifers to $805. The bull price was steady even though quality was no better than average."
"The yarding size remained level although the average quality of the offering appears to be slightly plainer as each week goes by. Most of the cattle were very plain with light conditioned weaners and yealings.   There were a few pens of older bullocks and fairly well conditioned cows.

There was plenty of restocker competition at the sale but buyers of trade or export cattle had limited numbers to select from. Restocker demand for weaners and yearlings was again very keen and even though the quality was barely maintained, the prices were. There were no trade cattle offered and all the young stock, with few exceptions, was bought by restockers.

Older bullocks sold at firm rates but there was a cheaper trend of 3c/kg on all cows, while the bull price remained unaltered. Heavier and older heifers were steady in price but the average weight and condition was below the previous sale standard."
"The yarding size remained fairly static but the quality was down both in condition and in breed quality. The worsening seasonal conditions are prompting growers to reduce the cow numbers and consequently there was a big increase in the yarding of plain, lightweight cows. Weaner cattle were well supplied but the majority were heifers with the bulk of the steer weaners having been sold in the past two months as the feed situation deteriorated. There were no bullocks or finished trade-weight cattle in the yarding mainly due to the fact that there are very few oat crops in the area on which to fatten young stock.

Most of the usual young cattle buyers attended but the lack of trade cattle meant that some of the orders could not be filled. The trend in the market was mainly cheaper but the pick of the steer weaners were firm. Secondary types were 10c/kg cheaper. As reported in earlier northern sales, the heifer weaner and vealer demand weakened considerably and most were between 15c and 20c/kg cheaper. Yearling feeder steers of the best quality were close to firm but plainer yearlings in both sexes were cheaper once again. A trade cattle quote was not possible.

No bullocks were yarded but export weight heifers were firm to slightly easier under a fair enquiry. Light, out of condition cows were cheaper by up to 20c/kg as the weight of numbers put pressure on the market. Better yielding cows were cheaper by 5c with bull prices weakening by 7c/kg."
"The yarding size is maintaining but the overall condition of the cattle has worsened each week recently. There were numbers of cows, weaners and plain yearlings yarded but there were very few fat stock available. This applied particularly to trade weight cattle and to heavy steers and bullocks. There were only three pens of well covered vealers available. Feeder and restocker yearling steers were in fair numbers and the breed quality was mostly fair.

The general trend within the market was cheaper with very few descriptions remaining on the firm level. An average fall in price over the whole yarding would have been 10c/kg but there were plenty of cattle that sold to 20c/kg cheaper and more in places. Among the few types that stayed at last sale levels were the few pens of quality vealers, the two and three score bullocks, export heifers, and restocker yearling steers of the better breed quality.

The bullock yarded were in small lots only with the best only in single sales. The cow market was much cheaper with manufacturing cows selling mostly at 10c/kg down, but there were pens that lost more value with restocker competition restricted. Feeder steers were cheaper under much less competition while the bull price remained firm.

The top sale price was 217.2c/kg paid for an outstanding pen of B muscle steer weaners bought by a restocker."
"The yarding size decreased again as it almost always does at this time of year. The average standard of the yarding showed a remarkable improvement with a much higher percentage of yearlings and cows coming forward off green oat crops. Restocker young cattle were well supplied but cows and heavy steers and bullocks were in lesser numbers. Quality slaughter vealers were also very difficult to source.

The demand for all descriptions was exceptionally strong with local restockers very keen to buy quality light young stock. Some of the heifer weaners with low body weight and the same in yearling heifers, recorded as much as 30c/kg rise although the average rise was not as high. Steer weaners and yearling steers attracted strong restocker competition and values were therefore considerably dearer. Demand for trade cattle created a dearer market with the lower numbers available being the reason.

The heavy steers and bullocks available were generally low yielding, and the prices struggled to remain firm. Demand for all cows improved as did the quality and the bulk of cows were 7c to 12c/kg dearer, but the better yields were responsible for a portion of the rise.

The top sale price of 206.2c/kg was paid for a pen of very light restocker weaner steers."
"The yarding size continued to hold at around 2000 head with winter not too far away. The condition of the yarding was plain but after so long in drought, the cattle are recovering lost condition remarkably quickly. Weaner numbers were down but there was a big yarding of yearlings and cows. The bullocks yarded were all plainer quality while feeder steers and yearling steers were in fair numbers and were fair to good breed quality.

The overall trend in the young cattle market was cheaper. The better steer weaners bought by restockers held firm but secondary types were cheaper. Heifer vealers were considerably cheaper but yearling steers held value for those bought by restockers. Yearling heifers were also cheaper with the plain bred cattle receiving the greatest price fall. The drop in price over all young cattle was probably in the area of 8c to 10c/kg on average.

The price falls continued on all export cattle with earlier prices not being sustained in the face of an escalating Australian dollar value. The bullocks yarded were low yielding and they sold at up to 10c/kg cheaper. Export heifers and light weight cows lost between 10c and 15c/kg from last sale values. The better cows, which were limited to medium weight two and three score types, were cheaper by 10c/kg. Bull prices receded by a further 6c/kg.

The top sale price recorded was 200.2c/kg paid by a restocker for light weight steer weaners bought by a restocker."
"The yarding size continued the recent downward trend and the numbers are unlikely to recover much before early December.  It was a particularly plain conditioned yarding with the great majority of the cattle showing the signs of a very cold winter.  There were mainly yearlings suitable for restocking, along with steers and heifers. Young bullocks were in short supply consisting of only one pen, cow numbers were restricted to around 70 head.  There were also a few pens of better quality feeder steers but most of those were in lighter condition. 

Demand for restocker yearlings and weaners was exceptionally strong with both steers and heifers increasing in value averaging 5c/kg, and more in some better quality cattle.  There were very few trade cattle available and 90% of the offering was bought by restockers.

A quote on export cattle was difficult due to a lack of numbers but the general impression was for an unchanged market, the exception being bulls which appeared cheaper by up to 10c/kg.  The few quality heavier feeder steers sold to a dearer trend for the best quality, but firm for plainer types."
"The yarding size continued at the lower levels for the season, with the availability of local cattle at normal numbers for this time of the year. There were some very well bred cattle yarded particularly in the young cattle section with restocker and feeder yearlings in good numbers. The were no trade cattle available and only a few pens of older bullocks. In the cow section, there were 50 head only yarded. The yarding of heavily muscled bulls was the best of the season.

Demand for all young cattle, weaners and restocker and feeder yearlings, was at the highest point for the year, with values for most up to 6c/kg dearer. A portion of the price rise was caused by the improvement in breed quality over most descriptions. With a considerable amount of winter yet to be experienced, most growers are buying earlier with the probable shortage of cattle closer to spring being the reason for the unprecedented demand.

There were not enough export cattle yarded to provide a reliable quote on bullocks and the cow and export heifer prices were fully firm. The bulls met a very strong demand to record values up to 12c/kg dearer."
"The yarding quality was generally plain with a greater number of cows yarded, most of which were two score fat measurement. Yearlings were also in larger numbers and most were light conditioned. There were only a few pens of bullocks available while trade weight cattle were in very short supply. There were greater bull numbers available.

There was a strong demand again for all young cattle with restocker steer yearlings and heifers and plain yearlings to slaughter selling at firm prices. Some of the light heifers that were bought by restockers and feed lots were dearer by a few cents per kilogram.

The few bullocks yarded sold to a stronger demand to record a slight price increase. The cows sold at firm rates for the slaughter portion while some of the lighter descriptions that went to restockers were marginally cheaper. The bulls sold to stronger demand to record a 5c/kg price rise.

The top sale price was 172.2c/kg paid for a single fat bullock."
"The yarding of only 280 was down from 820 last week, due to two major factors. Firstly,  the fall in values last sale discouraged Vendors while secondly,  good heavy rain over  the last two days prevented any major sell off. Quality was medium, with most of the yarding dry cows and weaners. Due to the low numbers, there were rises in all descriptions. Restockers were very keen but of course had little to work on."
"The yarding of cattle was down slightly, which appears to be the trend as numbers decrease a little each week. Weaners, yearlings and cows made up the biggest percentage of the yarding, although there was a few more pens of well finished and higher yielding grown steers through the sale. 

Overall quality of the young cattle was plain with the biggest majority showing the effects of the continuing dry and cold weather.  There was only an odd special lot that was well finished and they met good trade competition.  A fair percentage of the plain vealer heifers and all but a few of the weaner and yearling steers went to restockers who were prepared to buy, but at reduced rates.  The market was cheaper for all the young cattle however; the falls were not to the extremes of last week.

The yarding of export cattle consisted of several pens of well-finished steers and an improved penning of cows compared to last weeks yarding.  Bullocks and steers ranged from 3c to 7c/kg cheaper, while the cow market faired reasonably well with price falls not to the extent of last week.  Buyers showed a little more keenness with the market down by 5c to 9c/kg for the better cows, while some of the very plain cows held their value. 

Top price of the sale was for heavy vealer heifers at 138.2c/kg."
"The yarding of cattle was down significantly in comparison to the number of cattle that have been coming forward over the past weeks.  There is no sign of a break in the weather so only time will tell if numbers are actually starting to slow down.  Vealers and cows were once again well supplied while there was not the number of feeder cattle, yearlings and grown steers.  The number of plain cattle in the yarding continued to be the majority with the exception of a few special trade cattle and cows.   

There were some good runs of well-bred steer weaners, which attracted stronger competition from restockers to sell 6c/kg dearer.  It is becoming quite evident that the limited supply of well finished trade cattle are at last attracting increased demand resulting in higher prices with the heavier vealers and yearlings gaining 15c to 20c/kg.  Plainer vealers were also a little dearer.  Feeder cattle were in lighter numbers and sold according to quality.

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of cows with only an odd pen of steers and heifers.  Quality of the cows was fairly mixed with the biggest percentage in the plainer grades.  The market strengthened for most cows with heavy weights 4c/kg dearer and the plainer types selling firm to a dearer trend 

Top price of the sale was for heavy vealer steers to the trade at 167.2c/kg."
"The yarding of 1180 cattle represents a heavier offering than is usual for September. Quality was little changed, with most categories represented by reasonable numbers. Cows and export steers were the only cattle in lower numbers. There is still some feed in the area, and this accounts for the fairly regular quality standard.

Values for all the top yearling trade cattle showed little alteration, but the plainer types were cheaper by 2c to 3c/kg, with restock demand falling away on these cattle.

Heavy steers and light bullocks sold at firm rates for the few top quality pens but, the cattle just off the top quality were 3c/kg cheaper. Cows of all weights sold at very firm rates, while bulls and export feeder weight steers were just firm."
"The yarding of 1015 cattle, just a few more than last sale showed a slight quality increase, however there are still plenty of unfinished cattle about and the market continues to cheapen. Most descriptions were well represented but cows were in low numbers. The trend in the market was again cheaper for all stock, except perhaps for odd pens of the very best finished which were closer to firm. Yearling heifers and cows, showed the biggest loss in value.

Feedlot cattle were in very low numbers with little enquiry shown and Restockers were very quiet this week, probably hesitant as the values recede."
"The yarding numbers falling off is probably an indication that the last of the heavy sell-off is in sight. Quality was very plain, with  vealers and weaners of a lesser quality, and trade cattle very short supplied. There were over 600 cows offered, the bulk of them being light weight and plain condition. The usual Buyers attended the sale.

Values, almost in every category remained fully firm, and the only variations were caused by an improved quality article, or a drop in quality. 

Restock competition was restricted to the better breed quality types, but was nonetheless very solid."
"The yarding included some numbers of well bred weaners and yearlings together with a larger offering of medium weight cows as the auctions settle back into a regular pattern following a series of short weeks. Heavy steers and light bullocks were not plentiful and their fat quality was low. The normal number of weaner cattle were yarded for this time of the year.  

The usual number of fat stock buyers were in attendance but buyers of restock weaners and yearling steers were not as dominant in the bidding as they were earlier in the late summer and early autumn.

The trend in the market for steer weaners and yearling steers was considerably easier with all but the very few best breed types selling at between 5c to 7c/kg cheaper. The heavy supply of these types currently available in the north, has led to a market weakening through sheer weight of numbers.

Heifer vealers eased back in price and it is reported that abattoirs have large supplies of light cattle on hand.

On the other hand yearling heifers with any quality sold at relatively firm levels and it appears that their may be a temporary supply problem with trade heifers.

The yarding of heavy steers and bullocks was not well supplied but neither was the quality at a high level. Both these and the cows sold at firm levels compared to last sale.

Bulls were fair quality but sold to a cheaper trend with not much interest being shown by buyers."
"The yarding included over 300 cattle which were an advertised dispersal and were sold under the open auction system at the end of the market. There were some excellent lines of quality weaners steers and vealer heifers as well as a few pens of quality yearling restocker steers. The cows and trade cattle were plainer and bullocks were mainly in single sales. Export and older heifers were in fair numbers but trade steers were once again short supplied. Overall, the young cattle quality was better but the older cattle were down in quality.

There was quite a mix in market trends in young cattle with steers weaners 10c to 18c/kg dearer, selling to a generally local demand. Heifer weaners and vealers were 3c/kg dearer to restockers withy the slaughter portion firm to 3c/kg dearer. Yearling restocker steers were to 9c/kg dearer while the balance of the plainer young stock herld value.

No bullock quaote is possible but the plain  and lighter weight cows met a keen demand to be dearer by 10c/kg. The better yield cows were almost firm on average but there were a number of individual pens which were cheaper by a few cents. The demand for bulls was strong and values were 5c/kg dearer."
"The yarding comprised mainly of cows and plain store cattle this week, with no bullocks yarded,  and only small lots of heavy steers and trade yearlings available. The quality was fair to good on cows,  but the remainder were below the expected average quality.

The trade yearlings sold to a cheaper trend for steers, but the heifer portion,  while cheaper,  did not lose as much ground as the steers. Restockers were keen to buy lighter steers,  but the supply was severely limited.

The few pens that held heavy steers sold at cheaper rates, and the cows while selling at a very consistent market, were still cheaper. Bulls were the bright spot,  selling at dearer prices."
"The winter placed its stamp on most of the yarding, with very few offering or carrying more than 2 score fat.  There were numbers of 1 brand cows in light condition, which had been recently joined and therefore suitable for restockers.  Steer yearlings and heifer yearlings were in fair numbers, again most were suitable for restockers.  Fat stock was limited to a few pens of cows and heifers.  There were no bullocks, feeder steers or trade cattle apart from one pen of heifer yearlings.

The restocker market was strong with steer and heifer yearlings selling at firm to dearer rates for the heavier end, and up to 12c/kg dearer for extremely light weights.  There were not enough trade cattle to frame a market.

The restocker cows met a keen demand to sell at dearer rates to restockers. Older heifers were also steady as were bulls, while the very few pens of export cows showed no market difference."
"The wet weather during last weeks sale was not repeated and numbers increased accordingly. Quality was generally plain with the bulk of the cattle being lightweight yearlings suitable for both slaughter and restocking. There were limited numbers of heavy steers, bullocks and cows yarded, while export heifers were in fair numbers.

The regular buyers attended together with numbers of prospective restockers. Yearling steers to restock sold at firm rates while the heifer portion was also firm to marginally cheaper. Trade heifers were dearer but there were no trade steers on offer.

The few older feeder steers were firm but the heavy steers and bullocks to slaughter sold at dearer rates. Heavy heifers sold at similar prices to last week, while all cows were again up to 6c/kg dearer. The bull market price was unchanged.

Top sale price was 257.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight steer yearlings."
"The wet weather and subsequent high prices of last week were responsible for the heavy increase in numbers. With so many markets cancelled due to wet weather growers correctly anticipated another strong showing and increased their numbers. There were good numbers of splitter calves under 200kgs yarded as growers would rather take the price offering for light calves rather than anticipate a later market. Yearling heifers and steers were fair quality and in reasonable numbers while heavy steers and bullocks were not in great numbers. Cows were in much greater numbers following the very strong cow market last week. Feeder steers and heifers were reasonable quality and in fair numbers while bull numbers were much heavier than at any recent sale.

There was the anticipated strength in the young cattle market with all vealers and yearlings selling at a significantly higher rate. Feeder steers were included in that dearer trend but demand was greater than supply once again. Restocker demand was centered around the lighter yearlings and vealers which sold to a new level.

Following the extremely strong export cattle of last week some of the higher yielding cows sold at a cheaper rate as prices leveled to a more consistent rate. The medium and lightweight cows showed very little price change under a strong demand. Bullocks sold well with some of the better pens selling to dearer prices. But with the slight rise in yield taken into account there was really little change. The bull prices rose once again with the strongest demand yet evident."
"The was a wide variety of weights and quality in the yarding which varied from some well fattened crop fed cattle, down to a number of very light weight weaners under 200kg.The yearling numbers were again the greatest percentage of the offering while the cow supply is weakening each sale as calving draws closer. There were a number of pens of heavy steers and bullocks yarded, and feeder steers were again well supplied.

There was no sign of any market weakness in any of the young cattle, with restocker demand getting stronger with each week. Very light weaner steers and the yearling steers sold to a dearer market while the heifer portion of both remained firm. Yearling heifers to slaughter also met a steady but firm market. Trade cattle were very short in numbers but the few sold at firm rates.

Heavy steers to slaughter sold at unchanged values but the few pens of heavy weight bullocks met a quieter demand to be 4c/kg cheaper. Feeder steers were fully firm under the same competition as the last sale. The light weight cows available met steady demand from both exporters and restockers and prices were firm. Any better covered cows sold at a small price increase while the bull market was steady and unaltered.

The top sale price of 229.6c/kg was paid by a restocker for extremely light weight steer weaners."
"The was a larger yarding, with the increased numbers made up by young plain conditioned cattle. The quality of the yarding varied with some reasonably well finished cattle scattered throughout.

The young cattle market was fairly solid with heifer yearlings remaining mostly firm, the yearling steers to the trade however, lost 1c/kg to 2c/kg. Restocker cattle made up the bulk of the yearlings, the quality showing a fair variation. The better quality steers showed a dearer trend of upto 6c/kg while some of the plainer types lost a similar margin.

The export section saw cows and heavy steers sell to a firm trend, the bullocks however lost 6c/kg to 8c/kg, the older heifers sold at firm to slightly dearer rates. Heavy bulls sold 1c/kg to 2c/kg."
"The very strong market of last week saw producers look to take advantage, increasing numbers by over 600 head. All grades were represented with quite a few autumn drop vealers. Restockers were once again well catered for with a good supply of plain conditioned yearlings. There were only a small number of heavyweight steers while there was a good supply of grown heifers and cows. All regular buyers were in attendance as well as good local restocker competition.

There was quite a bit of variation in the young cattle market. A shortage of genuine milk vealers saw those sell well, particularly lightweights. Restockers were active on the steer grades. The yearling steers to restockers saw the most variation market trends. The better quality C muscle lightweight grade sold to a cheaper trend in the main, there were odd sales that were close to firm, however the trend was 14c to 18c/kg cheaper. Breed quality was also a contributing factor. The plain quality D muscle grades sold firm to dearer with restockers more concerned with the lightweights. The trend was similar for the heifer yearlings to both the trade and to restockers. Very lightweights sold to a dearer trend while the better quality trade heifers cheaper.

The grown cattle offering could not sustain the levels of last week with all but the heavy slaughter bulls showing a cheaper trend. There were only a small number of fair quality heavyweight steers penned with nothing to compare to from last week. The grown heifers sold cheaper, down 3c to 4c/kg on the better shaped grades. The cow market saw a drop of 4c to 10c/kg with the plain condition 2 score cows least affected. Heavy bulls to slaughter sold to a dearer trend with restockers paying to 198c/kg."
"The very small Armidale yarding is not unusual at this time of year and the forecast is that numbers will increase in November. Quality was fairly plain and the yarding consisted of very light heifer yearlings together with good pens of restocker steers and cows. There were a few pens of crop fattened heavy steers, but there were no bullocks available. The usual buyers attended and the market trend was firm to dearer.

Very light yearling heifers sold particularly well to record significant price increases. Yearling steers all to restockers sold strongly again to be fully firm, while the few trade heifers were improved in price.

There were enough heavy steers to show rises of 4c and 5c/kg. There were few extra heavy cows yarded, but the medium 4 scores sold at fully firm rates. The bull market made a sudden improvement in prices due to extra competition which was not available at earlier sales."
"The very low numbers continued with the end of the previous production cycle and the new on just beginning. The quality of the offering was generally fairly plain with only a few head in each category. There was a limited buying group and this combined with the quality impacted most prices.

There were insufficient numbers for a quote on market trends, however prices for all classes of young stock were cheaper, and significantly so in places.

Cows held up reasonably well for a limited supply. The bull market suffered from a drop in quality and reduced competition to see prices again significantly cheaper.

Due to the low numbers a decision has been made to hold sales on a fortnightly basis until the end of the calendar year."
"The very big increase in numbers was anticipated as the weather gets dryer and the feed is now deteriorating quickly. Quality was fair with some very big numbers of yearling feeder steers and heifers available. The light splitter vealers and cows were also well supplied while heavy steers and bullocks were in sufficient numbers to quote a market. Overall the quality of the yarding was improved.

The usual buyers of young cattle were in attendance but the market was again cheaper for most young cattle. The very light vealers and the feeder steers were down marginally but the plainer quality were cheaper by 7c and 8c/kg. The same situation applied to the heifer feeders. There were only a few restocker steers yarded but they sold at almost firm prices. 

One major exporter was not operating but the balance of the usual buyers were in attendance. The bullocks available were good yielding types and they sold at 6c/kg cheaper than the sale before the break as there were not enough to quote in last weeks sale. Plain heavy steers were again cheaper while the cow market lost 10c from the price that has now aggregated a loss of 45 to 50c/kg in just a few weeks.

The top sale price was 257.2c/kg paid for light vealers to slaughter."
"The usual downturn in numbers continued with another small yarding. Most categories were represented with quality very mixed. There were some well finished yearlings, heavy steers and cows, however, for the most part, condition was on the lower end of the scale. The usual processors were in attendance however, given the low numbers, there was no feed lotter activity.

Trends varied through the young cattle, with steer vealers to restock selling to a cheaper trend, breed and quality a factor. Very light weight yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend while the lack of feedlot competition saw medium and heavy weights sell to a cheaper trend. Yearling heifers also sold to a cheaper trend however there were odd exceptions. Medium weight heifers to the trade and restockers were 7c to 20c/kg cheaper.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend, with quality a contributing factor. There was little but quality related change in the cow market. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend with a lift in quality contributing."
"The trend towards the smaller yardings continued, and this is expected to remain with us until at least the start of next year. The quality was extremely varied with a few pens of quality fat cattle available in all descriptions except vealers. The balance showed the signs of the very hard winter that was experienced with some cows and calves in extremely light condition. The demand was there however for all the cattle yarded.

All the cattle in the yarding sold to a dearer trend following the light rain received this week. All yearlings either prime or in store condition sold to a dearer trend with both abattoirs and restockers almost desperate to buy due to the lack of numbers.

There were a few pens only of heavy steers and bullocks and they all sold to a very significantly dearer price. The same situation applied to all weights and condition in cows and also to the export heifers and quality bulls.

The top sale price was 164.2c/kg paid by an exporter for medium weight bullocks with just enough finish on them."
"The sudden drop in yarding size experienced is normal for the time of year. Quality was generally plain as the seasonal conditions deteriorate further. Yearlings and feeder cattle made up the largest portion of the sale, with bullocks and cows penned in very small lots. 

The young cattle market trends were generally firm or cheaper. Trade heifers and light and medium feeder steers and heifers sold at fully firm rates, but there were some pens of less suitable young heifers that were slightly cheaper. Restocking enquiry kept weaners and yearling steers at steady levels, but the numbers available were limited. 

There were only a few lots of bullocks yarded and they sold at firm rates provided they carried sufficient fat cover. Plainer types sold to 5c/kg cheaper. Cows and export heifers showed little price change, while the bulls carried less muscle and therefore sold at cheaper rates. Export feeder steers sold to a steady and firm market.

Top sale price was 212.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight steer weaners."
"The smaller Armidale yarding produced similar quality to last sale with the only obvious quality differences in older steers and bulls. The bulk of the yarding comprised bulls, cows, heifers and yearling steers with a few pens of cows with calves at the end of the sale. There appears to be a considerable shortage of heavy cattle and well-finished trade cattle across the Northern Tablelands. It seems that most of the older cattle have been sold earlier and the good season is allowing cattle to be held to value-add during the autumn.

The buying power did not vary from last week and the bulk of the cattle sold at fully firm rates compared to last sale. The obvious exceptions were in the cows which sold to 1c or 2c/kg cheaper for the better cattle and the bulls which were dearer, but of vastly better quality. Very light heifers in the vicinity of 200kg continue to draw solid prices with all of them going to slaughter.

The heavy steers were only in small lots with restockers buying most to return them to the market next year as bullocks.On yearling steers, restocker demand is very constant at ever improving prices."
"The small yardings continued  with little likelihood of improvement much before the Christmas break.  Quality was better with the yarding comprising mainly of yearlings and cows.  There were a very few pens of heavy steers and light calves available but they were sold mostly in small lots.  Trade heifers were supplementary fed.

The market generally was fully firm or dearer.  There was very little alteration in the price of yearlings either to slaughter or to restockers and the same market situation applied to the few light calves yarded.  Even with the poor pasture situation in the area, there is still a good demand for young cattle from restockers, who may have been attracted by the recent fall in values.

Only single sales were yarded in bullocks while the heavy steers sold at firm rates.  Following the northern trend this week, cows showed a very considerable price rise to partially reverse the price fall of last week.  Some sales were to 20c dearer, while an average price rise was 15c/kg."
"The small rise in numbers at Armidale today is encouraging in that the numbers expected in November may be coming forward a little earlier, due to the good season and the strong values. There were some very well bred cattle yarded in the yearling steers to restockers and in the cows offered. The very light heifer yearlings were available in good numbers. There were a few pens of heavy steers and bullocks of fair quality and bulls were available in greater numbers.

The usual buyers attended the sale, but there was not quite the sting in the market for young cattle that we have seen over recent weeks. Very light yearling heifers that have been selling so well recently lost 10c/kg from their price. The plainer bred yearling steers usually bought by restockers met slightly less demand, but the better bred cattle were fully firm. All the yearling steers in the yarding were bought by restockers.

The export cattle sold to a strong market again with steers and bullocks selling right up to previous values. Cows were in greater numbers and sold well to record dearer rates in the medium and heavy 3 and 4 score types. The bull market was a little weaker for the lower yield cattle, but there was little change for the heavier bulls."
"The small offering was not unusual at this time of the year, with the major selling period having passed.  There was not a lot of quality in the yarding with the bulk being very light weight yearlings suitable for restockers.  There were no bullocks or feeder steers available and cows were only in very small lots.  It appears likely that numbers of cattle will not increase much before the early part of the summer. 

Restockers were the major force in the market, and for young cattle the market trend was wide ranging between firm and cheaper.  The restocker yearling steers and the few pens of steer weaners were fully firm but yearling heifers were cheaper with restocker while feeder competition was slightly reduced. Trade weight cattle were mainly bought by restockers and therefore no market quote is possible.

There can be no bullock, feeder steer or heavy steer quote due to a lack of numbers.  The very few cows yarded sold at firm rates as did the medium quality yarding of bulls."
"The slightly smaller yarding fell away very sharply in quality, with finished cattle short supplied, as were heavy export cattle. A big percentage of the offering were very plain. The majority of the light weight yearling steers and heifers, coming from the unimproved, local area pastures, were purchased by local restockers.

Some of the very light and plain young heifers sold at up to 20c/kg cheaper due to the non  attendance of one major buyer for these types of cattle.The better quality yearling steers and the trade heifers sold at firm rates.

There was very little alteration in the prices paid for cows, although some pens of off type cows did show a weaker tendency. Bulls were well supplied but sold at a cheaper rate."
"The slightly bigger yarding contained a few pens of better-finished cattle off oat crops. The biggest numbers yarded were yearling steers to restock and yearling heifers to slaughter. There were only a few grown cattle in the yarding. There was slightly less competition available on the slaughter cattle due to the lack of fattened cattle. There have been some extremely heavy frosts recently and they have taken their toll on most cattle in the area.

Restocker steer weaners and yearlings sold at fully firm prices but there was an uneven trend in the trade heifers and a few weaner heifers with their values generally marginally cheaper. The demand for light cattle to restock is still very strong with supply on the Tablelands very light at this time.

Older heifers sold to a strong demand but a definite quote on cows is not possible due to the low numbers. It was obvious that the demand was there for both heavy steers and cows but there was no supply."
"The size of the yarding reduced in line with the earlier forecast. It was a very wintery yarding with weaner and vealer heifers in the majority. There were also good numbers of  feeder and yearling restocker steers yarded with the breed quality only fair. Trade heifers were under supplied. There were only a few pens of light bullocks available and it was the smallest yarding of cows since last December.

The young cattle market was once again set at a very high level with weaners steers to restock and vealer heifers selling at fully firm rates. Feeder steers and the plainer restocker yearling steers were again firm, but there were pens of the best bred cattle selling at marginally higher prices .Demand for any restocker cattle is showing a sign of lifting following light but valuable rain.

The few pens of bullocks were in the main underdone for condition but they sold at very solid prices. There were only just enough cows available to quote the market which remained unchanged. There were a few very good bulls yarded and they also sold at firm rates."
"The size of the yarding is rising as the temperature increases and the pasture quality drops alarmingly. Yearlings and cows were the majority numbers in a fairly plain yarding of a similar quality to last sale. Splitter vealers were in greater numbers as that market is slipping away and growers want to sell before the price drops further. Bullocks and the older steers were short supplied this week, as most would have been sold before now.  Bulls were in bigger numbers than usual.

The market was cheaper for most young cattle with splitter calves showing the most loss. Trade heifers sold at a cheaper rate also for most lots but there were a few pens at the end of the sale that sold at fully firm rates. Restocker yearling steers lost some value as the number of growers looking for these types had reduced in the hot weather. Shop vealers over 200kg and trade steers were very lightly supplied.

Older feeder steers and bullocks were not in very big numbers and they sold to an easier trend for the third week in succession. There were some pens of top cows that sold at very much the same rates as last sale but generally the cows were cheaper by around 6 to 7c/kg under much quieter demand. There was extra competition in the bull market as one abattoir that has been out since before Christmas is again trading."
"The size of the yarding is as expected, being consistent with yardings in excess of 1,200 head as the usual late summer and early spring sell off commences. The bulk of the yarding were export cattle carrying good condition. The bullocks yarded, were the biggest numbers for this season, while trade cattle were few in number and only of average quality. The usual numbers of buyers attended the sale.

It is too early for numbers of vealers to be sold although trade cattle sold at consistent and firm rates even though they were not in big numbers.

There were a few more restocker yearling steers  in the yarding selling at unchanged rates under the usual strong demand.

There were more genuine bullocks of all weights in the offering and they sold at prices equal to last sale prices with demand for these types very strong.

Not as many high yielding cows were available but they sold to a slightly stronger market. It appears that the numbers of cows available throughout the area may be about to reduce in the coming weeks.

Almost 70 head of bulls were yarded and they sold at much improved prices with the enquiry strengthening through the sale."
"The size of the yarding came back up to expectation following the end of the financial year. There were numbers of well bred cattle yarded but not too many well fattened slaughter stock. Weaners were in fair numbers as were yearlings and cows. Heavy steers and bullocks were in very light supply. Feeder steers were light for numbers but restock yearlings and older steers to fatten were reasonably well supplied.

The market for young stock was solid with one exception. Splitter heifer vealers around 200kgs were slightly easier. Restock steer weaners and yearlings were very solid and demand was again very keen. Trade heifers were fully firm although quality was fair only.

The export type cattle were in the limelight again with the better heavy steers and light bullocks showing a dearer tendency of 2c to 3c/kg. The older steers to restock showed the same increases. The market for cows was stronger once again. Quality high yielding cows were far from plentiful therefore making the price rises once again significant. Bull rates did not vary from last sale."
"The size of the offering was in vast contrast to the height of the drought forced sell off. Following next weeks sale Armidale will revert to fortnightly cattle sales. Young cattle and cows made up most of the offering with quality generally plain. There were small numbers of well finished cattle penned. The usual processors were in attendance, however given the low numbers not all operated. There was an extra processor order bidding on cows. 

There were very few cattle in the young cattle classes. Restockers and feedlotters participated, however the low numbers and quality affected price change. Market trends were generally dearer. There were breed premiums in some cases and discounts for the plainer quality cattle.

Plain condition lightweight cows sold to a dearer trend. Medium weights were firm to slightly cheaper. The extra competition saw heavyweight cows sell on a firm to slightly dearer trend."
"The shortened week saw numbers reduced significantly. Vealers made up over 50% of the offering with cows coming forward in good numbers also. Yearlings and grown cattle were in limited numbers. Most regular buyers were in attendance although the lower numbers kept some away.

The young cattle market was very strong in comparison to recent weeks. A hint of rain putting a deal of confidence into restockers. There were quite a number of well bred vealer cattle on offer. Steer vealers to restockers met keen competition, firm to 5c/kg dearer. The heifer portion met much stronger demand from both processors and restockers, with trade heifer vealers up 6c to 20c, and the restocker heifer vealers dearer by 8c to 20c/kg. There were very few yearling steers, all going to restocker and feeder interests at rates 1c to 19c/kg dearer. The yearling heifers to the trade saw values improve by 10c to 15c/kg.

There were insufficient grown steers for a quote. The cow market reversed the trend of recent weeks, the light processor cows were 2c to 5c dearer while restockers were also active with suitable lines 15c to 23c/kg dearer. Medium weight slaughter cows were dearer, up 3c to 12c, while the heavy cows saw rises of 16c to 19c/kg."
"The short working week had the effect of reducing the numbers yarded, however, the lighter numbers led to a firm to slightly dearer set of values. All descriptions of slaughter stock were either firm or one or two cents dearer, while restock steer calves and yearling steers were in stronger demand to be 2c to 3 cents better.

The quality of the young cattle yarded was just below last sale, there were only singles and two's in heavy steers, and the cows carried a little more condition than last sale."
"The short trading week saw the number of cattle yarded well down.  Vealer steers were well supplied and there was a fair penning of vealer heifers.  Yearling steers were in limited numbers, while there was a good supply of heifers.  Grown steers and heifers were in small numbers , there was a good yarding of cows.

Quality was plainer with not many well finished cattle yarded, compared to previous weeks however, there was some good runs of well bred vealer steers offered.  Competition was weaker for young cattle with restocker vealer steers selling 10c cheaper and vealer heifers lost 3c/kg.  The largest percentage of yearling steers and heifers went to restockers and feeders.  Feeder steers sold to an easier trend, while medium weight feeder heifers lost 10c/kg however, heavy feeder heifers saw little change.

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of cows, with only a few pens of steers and heifers.  Grown steers were mainly unchanged, while heifers lost 12c/kg and the cow market held firm."
"The shade larger yarding contained a similar quality line up of cattle to the previous sale.  Most of the yarding comprised of yearling steers and heifers suitable for the lot feeders and restockers.  Trade weight slaughter cattle were scarce in the market and processors had to compete with lot feeders on any suitable stock. There was only the odd pen of finished steers and bullocks, while cows were yarded in fair numbers.

The usual buyers attended the sale and the largest proportion of the steer and heifer categories sold to either lot feeders or restockers.  Steer yearlings met a firm to a 4c to 6c/kg easier trend while the heifer portion remained at least fully firm to a shade dearer.

Steers and bullocks showed little change either way.  Plain conditioned cows eased by 6c to 10c, with the better conditioned 3 and 4 score cows easing around 3c to 4c/kg.

A pen of well-bred restocker yearling steers gained the top sale price of 248c/kg."
"The same sized yarding of cattle, saw a quality improvement in most categories. Trade cattle were very short in number,  and the bulk of the yarding was made up with cows, bulls,  and yearling steers.   The overall quality was above last weeks sale.

The few trade and restock yearlings sold at improved rates,  the lack of numbers providing the impetus .

Heavy steers and the few bullocks sold at a little better rate,  while cows and bulls showed a reasonable rise in value. The heavy export heifers were in fair numbers,  and along with all the export cattle,  were met with strong competition,  with a shortage of numbers the reason for improvement."
"The same sized yarding at 1700, with over 500 weaners and light veal yarded, and also over 500 cows offered. Quality on half the yard was a little better than last sale,  but there are still  plenty of unfinished and below average breed quality cattle being presented.

As has been the case all week, the very top in quality across all types is selling at firm rates while the plain and just under finished cattle  were 3 cents cheaper. There were a few more better bullocks available selling up to 7c/kg dearer, but at least 3 cents of that rise referred to the quality improvement.

Restock demand was available, but buying was cautious."
"The same sized yarding at 1035, but a very wintery look about the cattle, with the quality back on all categories. That lack of quality played a part in the falls recorded in the price of C2  vealer heifers and steers, and the same losses were recorded for yearling steers.Tradeweight heifers, heavy steers and bullocks stayed at last sale rates, but the cows, even with a drop in yield taken into account, were cheaper.

The restock demand was just as strong as ever, with the values a little softer, and those yearling steers and trade heifers made up the bulk of the offering."
"The sale numbers remained the same this week, although the offering  of well finished cattle dropped. The quality at best could be described as mixed and overall on the plainer side.

The trade and restocker cattle market remained strong despite the drop in quality. Trade yearlings were  firm with very light weight heifer yearlings selling to a dearer trend of up to 10c/kg. In most grades the quality of the cattle dictated the variation in averages. As the warmer weather approaches,  the restockers are gearing themselves up pushing values up by 3c/kg on suitable stock. Once again the quality determined the average fluctuations.

The export section of the yarding saw some very good heavy cows and a few grainfed bullocks penned. The market for bullocks remained fully firm.  The heavy steers were affected by quality and these varied a little with the 3 scores selling at dearer rates. 

The cow market remained firm with a greater percentage of heavyweights penned.  The quality of the 3 score cows was well down which had  an adverse affect on prices. The quality of the bulls also varied as reflected in the prices paid."
"The rise in numbers was surprising at this time of year although the very high prices and the need for a good fall of rain obviously played a part. There were 60 head yarded in the EU most being light bullocks. The quality and yield in the fat cattle yarded was a long way better than in the previous sale with cows and bullocks in greater numbers as were the feeder steers most of which were light weight. Trade cattle were light supplied once again.

The bigger numbers had no detrimental affect on the market with the trend overall being firm to dearer. The light vealers under 200kg sold to a considerable price rise while trade cattle were fully firm. Most feeder steers were dearer and rose by a similar amount to the restocker steers. The restocker cattle demand keeps increasing forcing prices higher and higher each week.

There was a sizeable rise in the price of heavy steers and light bullocks and cows although a fair percentage of the apparent rise was taken up by the better yield in these descriptions. The bulls yarded were plain but their market was firm.

For perhaps the first time the average price over the yarding well exceeded 200c/kg and the numbers of feeder and store steers would have had a considerable bearing.

Top sale price was 276.2c/kg for light vealers weighing 160kg."
"The rise in numbers was no doubt caused by the escalating cattle prices following the rain. Feeder steers and yearlings were the main numbers in the sale while heavy steers and bullocks were in normal supply. Cows once again were in small lots with only 60 head available. Restocker steer yearlings and weaners were in fair numbers as is usual. The trend in the market was firm and dearer across all descriptions with the usual buyers in attendance. 

Restocker and feeder demand for steers was intense as prospective buyers do battle for the limited numbers currently available. The nett effect on prices therefore was a rise of considerable proportion. Vealers and the better trade heifers sold at dearer prices under a strong demand. Feeder steers in all weights met sustained bidding to record dearer prices.

The demand for heavy steers and bullocks was also as keen as the market has seen with a dearer trend obvious in all weights. There were obviously insufficient of these cattle to satisfy the demand. The same applied to the cows with the low numbers creating some of the best prices yet recorded at this market.

The top price in the sale was 230.2c/kg paid by restockers for lightweight steer weaners."
"The regular market was followed by a special store weaner sale which yarded 500 head. This report does not report the store sale in detail. The regular market yarded by far the plainest quality cattle that have been seen so far this season. Weaners and yearlings and cows were in the biggest numbers with almost all of the younger cattle showing the affects of the long dry and the extremely cold weather. There were a few pens of heavy steers and bullocks, all of which lacked a high yield, as well as a high degree of finish. The average quality and weight in the cows was also much lower.

There were some extremely severe price falls on many of the weaner cattle with those falls between 25 and 35c/kg. The demand from restockers leveled off to the point where they were prepared to take a risk on buying but only at limited prices. Trade cattle were very short and they and the yearling restocker steers were cheaper by 6c/kg. Demand for the light heifer vealers was very subdued but the average condition of those cattle was particularly plain.

The heavy steers and bullocks were cheaper but the lack of yield played a big part in that fall. Best cows were just marginally cheaper but demand for light cows fell off very sharply and there were many plain cows that sold up to 17c/kg cheaper under a very noticeably quieter enquiry. Bulls stayed at close to last sale rates.

Top sale price was 145c/kg paid for heifer vealers. In the special store weaner sale the best steer weaners sold at an estimated 120c to 150c/kg."
"The reduction in numbers yarded is usual at this point in every season. The quality over all the young cattle was surprisingly much improved with some quality restocker steers weaners and a few pens of good trade yearlings off oat crops included in the yarding. There were bigger than usual numbers of grown steers and bullocks yarded but the supply of feeder steers was limited. Cows were again well represented by numbers with their quality and degree of finish unchanged from last sale.

The usual buyers were in attendance and there was a little extra competition available on restocker weaner cattle. The market was solid and unaltered for restocker cattle while heifer vealers to slaughter sold to a little better demand to record a few cents per kilogram price rise. The few pens of trade cattle sold to a dearer price but were very much better finished cattle than last sale.

Bullocks and heavy steers and feeder steers, even though they were in greater numbers, sold to a fully firm market. The few feeder steers were all export weights over 400kg. Light boner cows sold to a dearer trend with buyers paying a little more for pregnant cows than they did for the empty cows. The medium and heavy cows sold to a cheaper trend that varied between 5c and 8c/kg. There were not enough heavy bulls yarded to quote a market trend.

The top sale price was 150.2c/kg paid for medium weight trade steers off crop."
"The reduction in numbers was surprising but was probably caused by vendors keeping cattle back for the approaching annual weaner sales. There were some very well bred cattle again in the market but the average quality of the fat cattle was low and similar to last sale.

Yearlings and weaners were in the majority but older steers and cows were in light supply. All the usual buyers attended the sale. 

The overall trend in the market continued to be to the cheaper side for most slaughter cattle except cows, while the restocker yearling steers sold to the usual strong enquiry with prices between firm and 3c/kg dearer for some of the best.

Restocker steer weaners sold to a cheaper market for the first time since the opening of the weaner season in March while heifer veal averaged 6c/kg cheaper with odd plainer types selling to 10c/kg cheaper.

The bullocks were of plain quality and in low numbers and sold to a cheaper market but all the cows sold at much the same levels as last week. The cheaper trend in the heavy steer and bullock market has been reflected in most sales since last week, with numbers in Queensland being more freely available.

Bulls were not high yielding but they sold to a consistent set of values."
"The reduction in numbers mainly consisted of feeder steers and heifers and trade cattle. With the exception of some very good cows and a number of other cattle in other descriptions the average quality of the yarding was well down on last sale. There were over 200 head of very lightweight yearling cattle offered and they sold at open auction and all were bought by local restockers. Heavy steers and bullocks were limited to only a few pens in terms of quality.

The usual buyers of slaughter stock were in attendance and there were more potential store stock buyers bidding following some handy recent rainfall. The trend in the market was either fully firm or dearer. Restocker cattle sold to a stronger demand and the open auction cattle were $30/head dearer while the cattle over the scales sold at 20c/kg dearer. Trade cattle recorded fair gains for heifer yearlings but there were no yearling steers that were bought to slaughter.

The feeder steers and the heavy steers and light bullocks sold at fully firm rates compared to the last sale with the demand very strong but there were not many to chose from. The cow market was fully firm with any higher prices recorded caused by a much better yielding yarding of cows. The same applied to the bull prices.

The top sale price was 273.2c/kg which was paid for light vealers under 200kg."
"The reduced numbers are a true indication of just how many cattle have been cleared out of the district due to dry weather over the last twelve months. There were not too many fat cattle yarded but the few that were available were fair quality. By far the greatest numbers yarded were yearlings most of which were light conditioned and they were almost all bought by restockers. Feeder steers were low in numbers as were all weights of cows.

The market with one notable exception was particularly strong with all cattle except for feeder steers selling at dearer prices. The feeder steers were considerably cheaper with one major buyer not in attendance. All other young cattle varied between 5c and 20c/kg dearer depending on quality and condition with the bulk going to restockers. There were some pens of trade weight heifer yearlings that also sold at dearer prices.

There was a dearer market formed for the few bullocks and heavy steers but the shortage of numbers was the major reason for the rise in price. The same situation arose in the cow market with the lack of supply affecting the values to a very large extent. There was no change in the bull values.

The top sale price was 157c/kg paid by a restocker for light weight yearling steers."
"The recent very cold weather and the end of the weaner season were responsible for the very considerable fall in numbers. Whether this trend continues or not remains to be seen. The quality in the yarding was plain with good numbers of heifer weaners and vealers but very few steer weaners were yarded. Yearling heifers and restocker and feeder steers were in a greater percentage of the yarding than usual with their breed quality quite good. Bullocks and heavy steers were in small lots only with their quality consistent with last week. Cows were well represented but not many lots indicated high yield. The average yield of the slaughter cattle has been dropping recently due to the cold weather The weaner steers are weighing less than anticipated for the same reason.

The usual competition was available at the sale and the lower numbers caused the market trend to improve to firm to dearer. The steer weaners to restockers were fully firm on the lower rates of last week with demand very much the same. Heifer vealers and trade heifers were 2c to 3c/kg dearer and the demand was sustained from the start to the finish. Feeder and restocker yearling off steers stayed unchanged with the demand strong.

The bullocks were similar cattle to last week. The price paid varied and they sold between a firm to cheaper trend of 2c/kg with the drop in anticipated yield the probable cause of the variation. The cow demand picked up markedly with the average rises across all weight being 3c/kg, again the fall in number was mainly responsible for the rise. There was little change in the bull market."
"The recent sudden price falls were the probable cause of a drop in numbers. The bulk of the young cattle yarded, were not finished, and heavy export cattle were light supplied. The market trend was more positive, with some types dearer or firm, but light heifer vealers or weaners continue to drop away in price.

Two and three score steer and heifer yearlings sold to a dearer trend, mainly due to stronger demand from Restockers .The heifer vealers are attracting less competition each week, as their numbers increase, and have fallen back by 8c to 14c/kg, again this week.Steer calves are maintaining value.

The heavy steers yarded sold to a slightly dearer market, but numbers are light. Cows to slaughter sold to an almost firm market, while restock demand raised values by 5c/kg on very lightweight cows."
"The recent strong market saw a larger yarding of cattle offered with an increase in most classes of cattle. Vealers and yearlings were well supplied and there was a good yarding of cows. Quality of the young cattle was mixed with most in fair condition, however there was some good runs of well-bred cattle offered. The largest percentage of weaners and yearlings went to restockers and feeder buyers, with only an odd well finished steer and heifer being acquired by the trade. 

Competition was very strong with a common occurrence of prices over 300c/kg. Restocker vealer steers were 5c dearer topping at 319.2c, while a pen of heavy vealer heifers sold to a top of 301.2c/kg to restockers.  Medium weight feeder steers were up by 30c to average 292.2c and selling to a top of 311.2c, and heavy feeders to 308.2c/kg. Trade steers topped at 292c/kg. Feeder heifers were up by 17c to average around 257c and trade heifers sold to a top of 297c/kg.

The yarding of export cattle was made up of only an odd grown steer, a fair penning of heifers and cows were well supplied. Steers sold to 252c and heifers to 234c/kg. The cow market was stronger as most sales were 3c to 10c dearer, with medium weights averaging around 194c and heavy cows selling from 195c to 213c, while restockers paid from 175c to 204c/kg."
"The recent heavy frost which caused feed damage, is responsible for the increase in numbers.The quality was similar to last sale, with cows the the exception, the heavy yielding cows not available this week.  As with past sales, plain yearlings were in the majority in the offering.

Competition was strong on all cattle, with a dearer market for trade yearlings, a firm market for light 2 score heifers, and a firm market for restock yearling steers.

A feature was the dearer market for Export weight heifers, selling to 111.2 c/kg. A firm to dearer trend was seen for heavy steers, light bullocks,medium and heavy cows and bulls, but light cows sold to a slightly easier trend."
"The recent good rains limited the yarding size even further. The breed quality of the offering was good but there were not many prime cattle yarded. Weaners were in by far the greatest numbers in the market followed by cows, the bulk of which were lighter conditioned. There were three pens of quality bullocks, a number of pens of yearling heifers and the only yearling steers yarded were bought by restockers.

The recent good rains created a much stronger restocker demand to the extent that many lots of steer weaners were 25c/kg dearer. Heifer weaners showed similar price rises and yearling heifers and feeder yearling steers also rose considerably in value.

The few pens of quality bullocks were dearer by 10c/kg a portion of which was accounted for by the improved yield. Cows met very much keener enquiry and the lighter cows in particular were up to 12c/kg dearer. Heavy cows were 8c/kg dearer and bulls gained 5c/kg."
"The recent excellent rains reduced the yarding and well finished cattle stood out in an otherwise plain conditioned yarding. There were 500 cows and 450 lightweight vealers in the offering together with a few pens of bullocks and heavy steers, and the balance of the yarding were yearlings.

 The usual buyers were in attendance but the numbers of restocker buyers from outside the district were less than at the last sale. The lesser numbers of restockers present had little affect on the market with light steer and heifer vealers and lightweight yearling steers and heifers selling to a dearer trend. Trade heifers were only in small lots but they sold at very much stronger prices. Feeder cattle were in reduced supply as were the trade weight steer yearlings.

Export cattle for the fourth consecutive week, sold to a considerably dearer trend with the yarding of bullocks selling to 20c/kg dearer even though they were low yield cattle. The manufacturing cows also met strong demand to sell at dearer rates, while the better yielding cows were in short supply. As a result they were dearer in a range between 12c/kg and 20c/kg.

The top sale price of the day was 192.6c/kg paid for a pair of lightweight bullocks."
"The recent drop in values coupled with a good body of feed, combined to reduce numbers to a low 365 head of plain quality cattle, which was well below the last sale for all but the cows. The bulk of the offering were cows and yearlings,  with only a few steers or export heifers available. The small yarding may have helped to reduce the severity of the market falls.

Trade cattle of both sexes, and all weights, displayed market falls in excess of 10%,  while the restock yearling steers met with a much less enthusiastic enquiry .

The export cattle, mostly cows were greeted with a very limited demand, with two of the regular operators not attending the sale,  for one reason or another."
"The quality was similar for most descriptions, but the numbers of high yield cows were not in evidence. There was extra competition on export cattle, but the same operators serviced the trade and yearling market.

The trend was towards a firm to dearer market for all yearlings, either to the trade or to restock, with the strongest market being reserved for yearling steer and the best finished heifers.

Heavy steers appreciated the extra competition, to sell at a dearer market, while light bullocks were fully firm.

The medium and heavy cows received plenty of attention,  to sell at dearer rates, while bulls and export feeder steers met that same improvement."
"The quality was much the same as last week with the bulk of the yarding being light plain young cattle. Trade cattle were short supplied but there were numbers of 2 tooth steers and a few pens of bullocks. Cows were light supplied but there were a few pens of high yield cows and a fair percentage of light store cows. The usual buyers attended the sale. The trend in the market was variable but generally firm.

Very light heifer vealers sold well with some help coming from restockers who also were responsible for a marginal price rise in steer weaners. Trade cattle were just firm with a few plain heifers struggling to retain last sale rates. Some of the steers, around 400 to 450kg and with two teeth showing sold to an irregular pattern but generally were 3c/kg cheaper.

Heavy steers and bullocks sold to a slightly cheaper rate but the demand was consistent. Cows sold well again with the lightweights meeting keen restocker enquiry. The bull market was considerably dearer with that market seeming to improve to a greater degree than any other cattle. Quality improvement was also a factor in the price rise."
"The quality was improved with more better cows and a greater number of crop fed trade yearlings offered, yet in the majority were the plainer, lighter yearling heifers. The restocker steer weaners and heifers were in fair supply and there was only a few pens of grown steers, while the bulls that were yarded were of a higher yielding potential. 

All of the usual buyers were in attendance and the trend in the young cattle was firm to dearer. Splitter vealers around the 200kg range were also firm to slightly dearer. The restocker yearling steers regained a part of last sales loss as did the restocker yearling heifers to be 6c to 7c/kg dearer under strong competition.

Export cattle met another good reception to record fully firm prices in both the few pens of heavy steers and all the cows. The older heifers also met keen competition to be fully firm on last weeks values."
"The quality was fairly plain and well below last sale on average. Close to 80% of the offering were females with heifers and cows sharing the percentage. Heavy steers were short supplied and restocker yearling steers that have been available in fair numbers have suddenly tightened up for supply. The older steers that were yarded were off type and under fattened generally.

The trend in the market varied quite considerably with all the usual buyers in attendance. Light yearling heifers were in a very strong position with 3c and 4c price rises very common. The shortage of these light cattle has been a feature for a number of months with the market holding well. The restocker yearling steers lost some ground as the fattening season is half over in New England. There have basically been no shop trade vealers in the market yet, but calves to 4 months have been in fair numbers, no doubt yarded because of their strong market.

The numbers of finished grown steers have fallen back in this area, but so have the prices with other areas yarding significant numbers. The cow market was again cheaper right across all descriptions with restocker demand on light weights almost non-existent."
"The quality was fair to good in an increased offering. The yarding comprised a large penning of vealers along with good numbers of heavy steers and cows. All regular buyers were in attendance although once again some export processors were not operating as strongly as their supply lines are full.

The young cattle offering comprised an improved penning of very good quality vealer steers and heifers. The market saw a little variation. The best quality heifer vealers to feed sold at dearer rates. This flowed onto the heifer vealers to processors with the market trend showing firm to 3c/kg dearer. Most of the steer portion sold to restockers at rates generally firm on last week, taking into account the improved quality and increased weight. Yearling steers also sold mainly to restockers, saw a cheaper trend, down 2c to 4c/kg. Heifer yearlings, both trade and feed sold to a cheaper market trend, down 4c to 10c/kg.

The grown cattle market continues to suffer from high dollar and supply issues. Heavy steers sold to a cheaper trend, down 5c to 9c. The cow market saw the best finished cows in all weight ranges sell at firm rates, while those cows not quite finished sold 4c to 5c/kg cheaper."
"The quality of the young cattle was marginally improved in a similar sized yarding. There were some good lines of steer weaners and yearling steers suitable for restocking, and trade and feeder yearling heifers were well supplied. Bullocks, heavy steers, and all weights of cows were in lesser numbers than the previous sale, and their quality was reduced. Heavy high yielding cows were in much lower numbers.

Restocker demand for young stock was again very strong, with weaner steers and yearling steers meeting another fully firm market. Trade and feeder yearling heifers met less competition to record price falls of 5c to 8c/kg. Trade steers were short supplied but the market for the few available was steady.

Heavy feeder steers over 500kg met restricted demand and were cheaper. Heavy steers and bullocks were cheaper, with the plainer types, together with the older descriptions, suffering considerable price falls. Quality in the cow yarding was down and prices were easier, with light and medium cows losing the most value.  Bull prices were unaltered.

The top sale price of 223.2c/kg was paid by a restocker for medium weight steer vealers."
"The quality of the yarding was very plain with finished cattle being in the minority. The numbers of half finished steers in the offering is increasing as the feed quantity drops away. Yearling trade cattle are very short supplied due to the rapid deterioration in feed quality. The regular buyers attended the sale.

Trade cattle sold to a regular and consistent value even though numbers of quality cattle are severely restricted.  Restocker yearling steers continue to sell to a very stable demand.

There were 350 cows yarded which consisted of only average quality throughout. The demand was stronger with average rises of 3c/kg across all weights, being the feature of the sale. It does appear that there are not big numbers of cows being offered. This has caused the cow price to show slight increases .It is unlikely that cow numbers will increase in the near future. 

Bullock and heavy steer numbers are not great but the demand is consistent and the market was unaltered."
"The quality of the yarding was very mixed with very few big pens of cattle. The exception was the cow numbers at 500 head. There was also a very large increase in the offering of calves under 130kg in weight. The usual buyers attended but it was difficult for both trade and restocker buyers to put together reasonable numbers due to the variable quality.

The bulk of the restocker and trade cattle sold at firm rates while the splitter calves sold to 8c/kg dearer than the last sale.

Heavy steers and light bullocks were only of average quality, but nonetheless sold at firm rates to fair enquiry.

The bulk of the increased cow yarding were 3 score cattle under 520kg. Their was not quite the volatility in the bidding that has been seen in recent weeks and the market ruled from just firm to 2c/kg cheaper. There was no alteration in bull prices."
"The quality of the yarding was very mixed with fair numbers of light conditioned well-bred steer weaners available. Cows were well supplied ranging in condition from plain to well finished. Feeder steers were in reasonable numbers while well-finished vealers and yearlings were only lightly yarded.

All the usual buyers supported the sale with the market generally showing a dearer trend. Light veal calves had solid support reaching a top of 187Â¢/kg to average around 170c/kg. Restocker steer weaners lost a few cents while the heavier yearling steers to restockers increased 5c/kg. Feeder steers showing breed quality increased in value under solid competition. Both vealer and yearling heifers lifted 11c to 19c/kg due to increased demand on the numbers available.

Steers and bullocks improved in quality and this was reflected in a lift in price of up to 14c/kg. Restockers provided good competition on some of the younger plain conditioned cows lifting prices by 13 c/kg to these orders. Plain 2 score cows to slaughter eased 1c to 3c/kg while the best conditioned 3 and 4 scores sold at fully firm rates.

Four prime conditioned heifer vealers shared the top price of 193c/kg with a pen of steer weaners."
"The quality of the yarding was down on the previous sale with restocker steers and heifers comprising the bulk of those offered. Medium and heavy vealers were in very light numbers as were the heavy steers and bullocks. Trade cattle were also very lightly supplied. Cows were in bigger numbers probably due to the higher prices paid at the previous sale. There were a number of bulls available but the average yield was well down.

The market trend sent some very mixed signals with lightweight vealers selling to a marginally dearer trend. Feeder steers sold at almost firm prices for the very best bred cattle but were cheaper for plainer bred and lesser conditioned steers. The very light heifer yearlings were shared between slaughter and restockers and they sold to a dearer market. There were very few available trade cattle but there was little change in values.

There were not enough bullocks to quote a definite trend but the indication on the few available pens was towards a firm market. The big numbers of cows yarded sold to a cheaper trend across all weights with the greatest losses occurring in the heavier cattle. Generally the heavier export heifers sold at a cheaper rate but in some of the heaviest there were a number of sales where price was not altered.

The top price was 273.2c/kg paid for a single outstanding heifer vealer under 200kg."
"The quality of the yarding was considerably improved as the pasture conditions consolidate with greater than usual numbers of feeder steers of all weights. Heavy steers and light bullocks were also in good numbers as were the cows but light vealers and trade yearlings were again in short supply.

The scattered rains in southern Queensland areas which slowed down the local supply were responsible for a considerable increase in demand and therefore in price. Most descriptions were dearer with southern Queensland companies keen to keep their kill going. All classes of young cattle either to slaughter or to restock or feed on were dearer under sustained competition. Demand for restocker steers has again lifted in light of the improved feed but the supply is well below the demand.

The export cattle again due to shortages met very keen enquiry with heavy steers and bullocks as well as the feeder steers selling at dearer rates as did the feeder steers. All descriptions and weights of cows sold at dearer prices without exception. The bull market however remained fully firm.

The top sale price was 218.2c/kg paid for light splitter vealers."
"The quality of the yarding improved over all grades and numbers were higher. There was a good quality penning of steer vealers which were purchased by restockers. Both light and medium weight heifer vealers were in handy numbers. There were not a lot of yearlings purchased by the trade with feeder buyers and restockers were well catered for.

It was a strong market with only small price variations in places.  Strong restocker competition pushed the steer vealers to dearer levels, up 6c/kg. Light trade heifers showed little change while butcher vealers lost 3c to 6c/kg. Yearling steers to restock were 1c to 7c dearer while they sold 2c to 6c/kg stronger to lotfeeders.  Feeder heifers sold a shade easier while those purchased by the trade lost 4c/kg.

Export cattle were well supplied and most were displaying a good yield potential. Both the cows and bullocks showed little price change with only the odd quality variations here and there."
"The quality of the yarding both in condition and in breed terms was very plain with cows, weaners and yearlings in greatest numbers. There were very few finished cattle available while heavy steers and bullocks were in small lots only. There were a few feeder steers yarded but they were generally below standard from a breed viewpoint.

There was a strong perception in the market that prices were cheaper, but that was mainly caused by the fall in average quality producing lower prices per head. An exception was in the restocker steer weaners, which sold to an obviously cheaper rate of 5c to 6c/kg. Some of the weaner cattle yarded were very dry in the coat but there was a regular demand from restockers for those cattle.

The export cattle also sold at lower prices but the same situation applied, in that lower quality was mainly responsible for that perception. There was plenty of restocker demand available for the best types of fat score two cows, but there was little change in values of all cows. The bullocks and heavy steers yarded were not high yielding and their prices were therefore lower. The bull price was solid with odd sales a little dearer.

The top sale in the market was 203c/kg paid by a restocker for steer weaners."
"The quality of the overall yarding was at its lowest point for the year with only a few pens of yearling heifers and a few older heifers and cows being above fat score three in the market. The bulk of the yarding were splitter heifer weaners and yearling heifers, while there were a few pens of steer weaners and some older store steers. There were no true bullocks to quote nor were there sufficient cows available to quote. There were quite a few bulls yarded but of a plainer description.

There was an extremely strong market for the light heifer weaners and the lightest of the yearling heifers with prices ranging from 5c/kg and up to 14c/kg dearer. The extreme end of that price rise was fairly common throughout the whole sale. Steer weaners and some older store steers sold at dearer rates also. Trade heifers were not plentiful but still sold at firm prices.

There were no bullocks or heavy steers yarded other than a few two and three scores and therefore a reasonable comparison is not possible. There were insufficient cows yarded to give a definite quote but the indications pointed to a stronger market. There was no change in bull prices."
"The quality of the offering was very mixed. A large percentage of the penning lacked condition with much of the Eastern side of the drawing area experiencing very poor seasonal conditions. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering with few well finished grown steers and heifers. There were in excess of 100 bulls penned. The regular processors were in attendance and there was high demand from restockers and feedlotters.

It was a very strong market for light weight young cattle regardless of quality or breed, with restockers looking to reduce their dollar per head outlay. The good quality medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a slightly cheaper trend than pre-Christmas levels with a month between sales. Heavy yearling steers to feed were a little dearer. Heifer yearlings were firm to marginally dearer with a great variation in weight, condition and quality.

There were too few well-finished heavy grown steers and heifers to quote. There was strong demand for all classes of cows from processors with restockers also active on the plainer condition lots. Compared to pre-Christmas levels the market trend was up to 11c/kg dearer. Despite the large number of heavy bulls, competition between processors was at times fierce, with the best of the bulls almost 50c/kg dearer than the last sale in mid-December."
"The quality of the offering was very mixed despite the reduction in numbers. There were less young cattle penned while cow numbers increased in anticipation of a full field of buyers. All regular buyers were in operation.

The young cattle market saw some variation. Light trade vealers sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 15c/kg. Restocker weaner steers sold at dearer rates although numbers were limited. Restockers were active on yearling steers although heavier weights were being sought. The light grades remained firm with the medium weights selling to a dearer trend.
Heifer yearlings both to the trade and feed lots sold to a cheaper trend, down 5c to 6c/kg for the better quality cattle. The plainer quality grades saw greater price devaluations.

There were increased numbers of grown steers and cows penned. Steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend, up 3c to 8c/kg. The heavy steers to processors also sold to a dearer trend, up 8c to 10c/kg with the 2 tooth steers seeing the best of it. The cow market responded to a slightly better quality offering, the market firm to 3c/kg dearer for the well finished medium and heavy weights."
"The quality of the offering was slightly improved,  with a greater selection in young cattle and a fair number of cows, heavy steers and bullocks. Demand was equal to last sale with the usual field of operators in attendance.

Trade weight heifers were in greater demand to be dearer,  while all other vealers and yearlings sold at firm rates.

All export cattle were in demand,  and sold firm to just a little dearer. It was obvious that exporters were short of good yielding cows this week."
"The quality of the offering was generally plain and carried little condition following a tough winter, with no break in the season as yet. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering, with the majority falling into the light and very light weight and condition classes. There were some good medium and heavyweight cows, but very few well finished grown steers and heifers in the export section. There was limited export processor competition, with numbers not sufficient to attract the full complement at this time of the year. Restocker activity was high.

There was no report from last weekâ€™s sale to compare to, however, taking quality and condition into account, the young cattle to restockers sold right up to recent market levels. Restockers, local and from further afield, were keen to put low dollar value cattle into the paddock in the hope of a break in the season. The small number of medium and heavy yearling steers to restockers also sold up to recent levels.

Despite the limited competition, export cattle, mostly cows and bulls, sold at similar price levels of other Northern markets."
"The quality of the Armidale yarding was very plain with the numbers severely restricted by the recent heavy rain. The bulk of the yarding were light yearlings to slaughter and to restock, together with a few pens of cows and a number of cows and calves offered at the end of the sale. Heavy steers and bullocks were in light numbers and vealers were short supplied.

An extra buyer of light slaughter cattle attended, otherwise competition was similar to last sale. The market as expected was strong with light heifers around 200kg selling to a dearer trend under keen demand. Restockers steers were fully firm with demand continuing at a steady rate.

The few steers and bullocks available showed a slightly stronger trend, but numbers were restricted. The cows sold at fully firm rates, however once again there are very few reaching the market at present. The cows and calves all went to restockers with the top price at $575/head.

With only a few bulls yarded comparisons with the previous week are difficult to ascertain."
"The quality of most cattle improved to a marked degree with cows and heifers totalling close to 70% of the yarding. There were only a few pens of grown steers and virtually no bullocks available. Restocker yearling steers were fairly well supplied and mostly well bred with the demand for them as strong as ever.

Trade cattle sold at firm rates, however there were not the numbers of the yearling heifers around 230kg and above that we have seen recently. Restocker yearling steers sold at firm prices with the strong demand showing no sign of slackening.

The heavy steers were only in ones and twos but there was a slight sign of a weakening in price of 3c/kg.

The cow market was fully firm for all weights. There were plenty to chose from in cows displaying  good yield potential. The bull prices were a little weaker but a lack of quality was the major factor."
"The quality in the young cattle was plain with only a few pens reaching  3 score. The bulk of the yarding consisted of very light yearling heifers and restocker yearling steers. Heavy steers were short supplied while cows make up a heavy percentage of the offering. The quality fell below that of last week, however buying strength remained the same.

Young cattle to both the trade and restockers, maintained a firm market.The lighter grades are in very strong demand  from wholesalers and restockers due to the good feed situation. This has severly limited supply and forced the stronger market.

Heavy steers and bullocks are selling at firm prices although numbers yarded are down. The cow market weakened considerably with falls of 7c to 10c/kg on the 3 and 4 score grades which has continued the trend seen early in the week. Lighter grades faired slightly better due to some restocker competition."
"The quality and condition of the yarding was quiet good over all grades. There was a good quality penning of well bred steer vealers which were purchased by restockers and most pens were displaying plenty of weight. Light weight vealer heifers were purchased by the trade and restockers. Yearlings were also in handy numbers, with cattle suitable for trade restockers and feeder buyers.

The regular buyers competed in a very strong market. Vealer steers destined for the paddock gained 8c to 16c/kg due to eager competition. Light heifer vealers attracted both restocker and processor participation and they pushed values to dearer levels of 5c/kg. Trade steers remained fully firm to 6c/kg dearer to restock and feed, with the better finished pens purchased by the trade also lifting in value. The heifer portion met a mix of market trends and sold to the trade as well as restockers and feeder buyers.

There were several pens of well finished steers and bullocks included in the yarding and they enjoyed a price gain of 5c/kg. Cow quality was good, with most carrying a good fat cover and sold 1c to 9c/kg dearer."
"The prospect of a favourable spring along with the end of the regular production period saw numbers fall. Quality and condition was plain with the exception of a few crop finished cattle. The buying gallery was restricted due to the low numbers.

The last of the vealers saw restockers operating with few suitable to processors. Lightweight steers sold to a cheaper trend, down 1c to 6c/kg. Heifer vealers to restock lost 19c/kg. A very plain quality penning of yearling steers sold much cheaper due to weaker demand and quality. The quality of the heifer yearlings purchased by restockers was greatly improved with this reflected in prices received, the average up by 23c/kg. Well finished heifers suitable to the trade sold firm to 5c cheaper.

Heavy grown steers in limited numbers were affected by both quality and a lack of competition to sell cheaper. Grown heifers also sold to a cheaper trend. The cow market suffered from the same factors as the rest of the export cattle to record a cheaper market trend."
"The promise of rain saw numbers fall dramatically this week. The quality of the reduced offering was fair to good with the variation throughout the grades not as great as it was on last weeks big offering. All the regular buyers were in attendance although the extras from last week were absent. Weaners, yearling steers and cows were in the majority along with a few very good heavy steers.

Restocker confidence combined with reduced supply resulted in a young cattle market showing a dearer trend through most grades. Restockers were active on both weaner and yearling steers. Weaners were dearer up 8c to 10c, while the yearling steer grades were 15c to 20c/kg dearer and more for selected quality lines. Vealer heifers to the trade attracted stronger competition from the regular buyers, dearer by 10c to 15c/kg. Trade yearling heifers also experienced a strong market, the light weights dearer with the medium weight firm.

There were a better quality run of young heavy steers in the yarding, they sold at rates 10c to 15c/kg dearer. The offering of cows did not contain the lines of well bred store conditioned cows seen over the past 2 weeks; this had a negative effect on prices for restocker cows, although the trend was firm to dearer. Overall the cow market improved with the trend dearer by 6c to 9c/kg."
"The past few weeks, being the coldest part of the winter to date, has taken a toll on the condition of the yarding.  There was only 70 or 80 processor cattle yarded with the balance of the offering being weaners and yearlings suitable for restocking, together with a number of pens of heavier feeder steers, light weight feeder heifers and limited cow numbers.  The breed quality of the young cattle was slightly below the previous sale.  Bulls were in greater numbers but most lacked condition.

With spring approaching, competition from restockers increased and weaners and yearlings met a stronger demand, with the keenest bidding of the season to date.  Yearling steers were dearer by an average of 5c/kg with heifer weaners showing a similar rise.  Light feeder heifer yearlings were easier in price by an average of 5c to 7c/kg but restocker demand on light weights yearling heifers moved prices ahead of the previous sale.

No bullock or heavy steer quote was possible but the small yarding of cows saw values cheapen by 4c/kg.  The bull prices showed a similar loss."
"The overall numbers remained steady with all categories represented. Quality was mostly good with condition varying to suit all buyers. The regular processors were in attendance and there was a strong contingent of restockers.

Demand continued at high levels for all classes of young cattle. This created firm to dearer market trends. Restockers were active with weaners firm to dearer. The heavier steers were up to 20c dearer while medium and heavy heifer weaners were up to 7c/kg dearer. There was little but quality related price change for medium weight yearling steers to restock. Heavy yearling feeder steers were up to 5c/kg dearer. Yearling heifers saw dearer trends throughout with the majority carrying a high degree of finish. The improved quality accounted for some of the price improvement. Breed and buyer preference along with variations in quality accounted for much of the price variation within classes.

Grown steers and heifers sold on a firm to dearer market trend. The feeder steers 400-500kg experienced strong price gains with breed the major factor. Plain condition cows sold to a dearer trend while the well finished cows to process were 8c to 10c/kg cheaper. Whilst the highest price was equal to the previous week there was a significant improvement in yield potential. Bulls sold on a firm to dearer market trend."
"The overall numbers increased, with the inclusion of greater numbers of plain quality light weight young cattle. The quality of the penning was generally plain and there were very few well finished cattle available. The usual processors were in attendance however limited numbers restricted participation. The lack of suitable cattle also saw limited feedlot activity. Restockers were active on the light weight young cattle and store condition cows.

Market trends through the young cattle were generally cheaper, with quality a major factor in negative price changes. The limited supply of C muscle young cattle sold close to a firm trend, however there was also some quality related price change. Restricted trade competition saw well finished heifer yearlings sell to a cheaper trend.

There were no well finished heavy grown steers to quote, with most of the grown steers falling into the manufacturing steer category. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. There were some good quality store condition cows penned that attracted strong restocker competition, and this combined to create a dearer market trend on those cows returning to the paddock, while those to process were firm to cheaper. The limited number of well finished cows sold to a dearer trend. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend, of up to 15c/kg."
"The overall numbers increased, in what was a very mixed quality penning. Once again, there were quite a few plain quality and lightweight young cattle presented. There were only small numbers of well finished cattle, apart from cows. The same processors were in operation, in addition to an extra feedlot. Trends varied throughout and there were some price changes evident due to quality variations.

Very plain quality and condition steer weaners to restockers sold to a cheaper trend, with prices down up to 7c/kg. Light weight yearling steers to restockers also sold to a cheaper trend. The extra feedlot competition, with quality in some cases also showing improvement, saw medium and heavy yearling steers to restockers and feeders sell to a dearer trend. Plain quality and condition light weight yearling heifers, that showed little muscle, sold to restockers at a dearer trend. The better quality and condition medium weights to feed saw little change in prices.

Grown steers sold firm to dearer, for the generally plain condition offering, and well finished grown heifers followed a similar trend. Very plain condition light and medium weight cows sold to a cheaper trend, with restocker demand not as strong. 2 score medium weight cows saw a dearer trend, with those showing higher yield potential experiencing strong gains. Well finished medium and heavy weight cows were 2c to 5c/kg dearer. The bull market finished a little easier."
"The numbers yarded were stable but the quality was much improved with most categories displaying a number of well finished and well bred stock.

Vealers,weaners and yearlings were very well supplied and bullocks were yarded in good numbers. There were 400 cows on offer some of which were not quite as heavy in the yield as the last sale.

The usual buyers attended the sale and the market showed a firm to dearer trend having taken into account the improvement in quality.

Heifer vealers and yearling heifers to the trade showed a market improvement averaging 4c to 5c/kg. Yearling steers and the weaner steers bought by restockers or lot feeders sold at unaltered prices under a strong and consistent demand.

Light bullocks over 520kg were yarded in greater numbers than usual and they sold to good enquiry averaging 2c/kg dearer. No heavy bullocks were available.

Middle and light weight cows were dearer by 2c/kg with a stronger restocker enquiry being the major reason for the rise. The heavier cows sold well with most, but not all, showing improved values.

There were numbers of very high yielding bulls available and they sold under strong competiton to post a dearer market."
"The numbers yarded were almost double what could be considered as normal at this time of the year. There were numbers of heavy in calf cows yarded with their percentage being almost 40percent of the total and most were in fair to almost fat condition. Yearlings were also in fair numbers with weaners short supplied normally at this time of the year. There were some heavy steers and bullocks yarded but generally they were in small lots only.

The market overall was dearer with the demand increasing for almost all descriptions. An exception was the restocker steer weaners and light steer yearlings, which sold at almost firm prices under a weakening demand. Trade yearlings were in short supply but sold at slightly dearer prices while light yearling heifers and heifer weaners sold at increased levels. 

Feeder steers met a good and steady demand to sell at firm rates while demand for the better heavy steers and lightweight bullocks increased to provide a dearer trend. The cattle of most interest in the market were cows, which sold very strongly under a much more intense demand. All grades were dearer with all cows including those in calf attracting increased prices to slaughter. Some better cows sold up to 11c dearer while the average increase over the whole was around 7c/kg. 

The top sale price was 143.6c/kg paid for a small pen of well finished light bullocks."
"The numbers yarded normally falls away after the end of June and this year is no exception. There were some well finished cattle and some pens of well bred young cattle in the market and they included a reasonable percentage of restocker yearling steers. The steer weaners and cow numbers have fallen away and are now unlikely to appear in any numbers until early summer. 

Heavy steers and light bullocks off oat crops are now being yarded and are meeting good competition. The usual buyers of export cattle attended the sale but one buyer was missing from the regular buyers of trade cattle. The young cattle, either steers or heifers  to restockers or to slaughter, sold well on a very firm market. The store demand for all types of young stock is well maintained.

Some of the better pens of heavy cows were selling to a slightly dearer trend while the lighter cows sold to a fully firm market helped along by some keen store demand. The heavy steers and bullocks over 500 kg are in demand and most of them sold at slightly dearer rates averaging 2 c/kg. The offering of bulls did not include many heavily muscled types."
"The numbers yarded eased back before the 15 to 25 mls of rain fell, suggesting that numbers will be lighter for the rest of the winter.

Quality was only fair with very few weaners yarded giving an indication that those left in the district will be carried over to add value for next season. Yearling heifers and steers were yarded in fair numbers as were light bullocks and heavy steers. Cows were almost a third of the yarding, but they were mostly 2 and 3 score with a few 4 scores. Cow numbers are expected to fall away sharply following the end of the weaning.

The usual regular buyers attended together with a considerable number of restocker and feeder yearling steer orders. Vealer heifers sold at fully firm prices while restocker steers sold between firm and 2c/kg dearer. Trade steers and heifers also sold to a dearer trend of 1c to 2c/kg. There is plenty of demand for quality young cattle to kill but the supply is severely restricted and will now remain so until late in the spring.

The bulk of the bullocks yarded were not top yeilders and sold therefore at a slightly lower price than in other recent sales. The cow demand is still very healthy, but with the district weaning now completed it is certain that numbers reaching the sale will be severely restricted for 3 or 4 months."
"The numbers were well down, with good rain last week and a promise of another good follow up in the coming days. All categories were represented with grown heifers making up the largest number. Quality was mixed and condition was fair to good. The low numbers saw a reduced buying group.

Variations in quality played a role in price change through the young cattle and significantly so in places. Overall trends were cheaper with limited competition. The better quality cattle were least affected.

There was not a lot of change in the market trend for grown steers to feed with buyers active. Average quality improved and accounted for some strong price change. Feedlotters and processors competed strongly on the grown heifers. The market for those to process was dearer. A small number of cows also attracted keen processor competition, selling to a dearer trend. With very little competition from processors the bull market was significantly cheaper."
"The numbers were up quite a few from last weekâ€™s unreported sale. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering with the overall quality mixed. There were varying levels of condition with the average tending toward plain. There was limited processor competition however there was strong demand from restockers and lot feeders.

The high demand for cattle returning to the paddock saw all classes of light weight young cattle sell to dearer trends than the previously reported market. Young cattle suitable to lot feeders also sold to a dearer trend, with restockers competing strongly on the better quality lines, again the market trend was dearer than the previously reported sale.

There were no heavy grown steers to process to quote. The limited supply of well finished cows sold to a dearer trend, while the plainer condition cows attracted restocker activity at firm to dearer price levels."
"The numbers were reduced, and although the annual pre winters sell off continues, vealers were in good supply. The quality of the cattle was fair to good although the condition of the offering was clearly showing the effects of the recent cold weather. For the past week frosts have been regular. Once again young cattle made up the bulk of the offering with a fair penning of cows and a limited number of good heavyweights steers. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market that saw trends vary.

Vealer steers to restocker orders sold firm to 5c dearer with emphasis placed on breed quality. Heifer vealers to the trade and processors sold to a cheaper trend, mostly 2 score medium weights. They were down 3c to 8c while a very small number of 3 score vealer heifers sold a little dearer. Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c. Medium weight yearling steers remained firm with some good quality lines offered, once again all went to restock or feed. The medium weight feeder steers sold to a cheaper trend, down 6c. There was good competition for lightweight yearling heifers from feedlots and restockers with the market showing a dearer trend, up 4c. The balance of the yearling heifers sold firm to cheaper.

The quality of the heavyweight steers offered was variable, the best quality well finished steers sold at dearer rates while the plain quality steers sold at cheaper rates, overall taking this into account the trend was firm. Grown heifers followed a similar trend. The cow market followed the trend, with all grades showing a cheaper trend, down 3c to 6c/kg. Heavyweight bulls remained firm."
"The numbers were reduced with all categories represented with a high percentage of Cows. The quality and condition of the penning was fair to good throughout. There was increased processor competition with the return of a Northern processor.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with the heavier weight vealer steers to restockers selling to a cheaper trend. Average prices increased for medium weight yearling steers on the back of a quality improvement, the trend however was cheaper. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed sold to a significantly dearer trend with breed a major contributor. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers were much cheaper with weight variations contributing. The medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to restockers sold to dearer trends with an improvement in quality.

Heavy weight steers to feed over 500 kg sold to a much dearer trend and included some milk tooth lines. No market comparison for grown heifers. The return of that Northern processor had significant impact on the cow and bull markets with trends substantially dearer throughout.

Market reporter; James Armitage."
"The numbers were down with a reduced supply of vealers and yearling heifers. All regular buyers were in place and restocker competition for young cattle was good. The quality of the offering was mixed with some categories showing a large variation from the previous week.

The smaller number of vealer steer met with strong restocker competition. This resulted in a dearer trend of 7c/kg. Restockers were also active on the plainer condition vealer heifers at dearer prices, and outcompeted processors. The trend was 4c to 7c/kg dearer. The well finished 3 score vealers sold firm to 2c/kg cheaper. Light and heavy yearling steers sold to restockers and feeders at dearer prices with an improvement in quality and demand the major contributing factors. The medium weight yearling steers sold at cheaper prices for a plainer average quality penning. Trade yearling heifers sold firm to cheaper with the overall quality well below the previous sale, from both a breed and breeding perspective.

Grown cattle sold to a cheaper trend with quality affecting prices for heavy steers. The cow market was also cheaper with the trend 2c to 8c/kg cheaper. The better muscled cows were least affected. There were a lot less cows suitable to the restockers and quality was down."
"The numbers were down by 200 head, a surprisingly small drop when considering there was between 3 and 5 inches of rain over the week. Vealers and yearlings made up the biggest percentage of the offering and there were increased numbers of heavy steers while cow numbers were low. All regular orders were in place although there were a couple of different buyers.

The young cattle market saw trade vealers sell to a very strong market. The steer portion was up to 5c dearer while the light and medium weight heifer vealers to the trade improved by 10c to 20c/kg. There were only 2 lots of heifer vealers that went to restockers and they topped the vealer market. Yearling steers to restockers saw little change despite the rain, the market trend firm. Heifer yearlings to restock sold firm to slightly dearer for a better quality offering overall. The best of the heifer yearlings to the trade sold 10c/kg dearer with little change the balance.

The increased numbers of heavy steers also brought about a vast improvement in quality. The market also improved, up 3c to 10c/kg. Grown heifers sold slightly dearer for the best quality lots and firm the balance. 

The small offering of cows met increased demand with the better condition cows 4c to 5c/kg dearer. The plain condition cows showed a bit better price improvement. Heavy bulls also sold to a dearer trend."
"The numbers were average for March, but the quality was very mixed, and comprised of cows and lightweight weaners, yearling heifers, and a few more yearling steers than is usual. Fat cattle were short supplied in every category.

The usual meat operators attended, but there was an increase in demand on restock and slaughter yearlings.  Most of the trade cattle and yearling cattle overall, were dearer by 2c to 4c/kg, with Restockers providing the impetus for the rise.

There were a few bullocks and heavy steers were firm, while cows met their usual demand to remain unchanged on last sale rates."
"The numbers showed another increase as producers off loaded prior to the Easter break. No sale next week. Young cattle dominated the offering with limited numbers of heavy steers suitable to the processors, a fair selection of average quality cows. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market unable to sustain its recent levels.

Vealer steers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend, down 11c to 16c/kg. Heifer vealers to processors were less affected but still recorded a cheaper trend, down 3c to 5c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed suffered the greatest falls with heavy feeders and restocker steers cheaper by 15c to 17c. The medium weight feeder steers also showed a cheaper trend however the quality of the offering minimized the drop. Light and medium weight heifer yearlings to feed sold to a cheaper trend, down 7c to 18c while a limited number of heavy weights were 4c to 6c/kg cheaper.

Grown steers to feed sold to a cheaper trend inline with their younger counterparts. The limited supply of heavy steers to kill sold to a cheaper trend, down 10c/kg. Cows sold to a cheaper trend averaging falls of 4c to 6c/kg."
"The numbers returned to a reasonable level after the previous rain reduced offering. The quality and condition of the penning was very mixed. There was a good supply of young cattle suitable to restockers and there were some handy older steers and cows. All regular processors were in attendance and demand was strong.

Restockers continued to drive a very buoyant young cattle market. With little to compare to from the previous sale a trend is difficult, suffice to say all grades of yearling steers to restock and feed sold up to and over last weeks rates with price changes reflecting quality variations. The short supply of lightweight cattle suitable for processors was reflected in the market for heifer yearlings, which sold to a dearer trend. This followed through to those heifers purchased by restockers.

The lack of supply in the grown cattle from last week also makes a market trend difficult. The quality of the heavy steers was only fair with most carrying a bit of age. These steers sold in the range of recent sales throughout the North. The same applies to the grown heifers. The cow market remained firm."
"The numbers remained the same. There was a reduction in steer vealer numbers, while yearling cattle and heifer vealers were well supplied. The overall quality of the offering was very mixed with some very plain quality cattle penned. For the most part however the quality was fair to good. All regular buyers were in attendance with the addition of a Victorian kill order, not seen in this area for a very long time.

The market for young cattle was strong, particularly yearlings to both feed and the trade. Steer vealers, all purchased by restockers remained firm. Heifer vealers to the trade sold 4c/kg dearer and more in places. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend through all weight classes. Trade yearlings, both steers and heifers benefited from the increased competition to sell 15c to 20c/kg dearer and more in places.

There was a good quality offering of heavy steers and full mouth bullocks penned. The market trend was firm. The cow market remained generally firm with a small number of outstanding quality heavy weights up to 4c/kg dearer. Restockers were active on PTIC cows at dearer rates."
"The numbers remained the same despite some handy rainfalls through parts of the district during the early part of the week. The quality of the yarding was very mixed, with well finished young cattle scarce. There were increased numbers of cows, older steers and vealers as well as quite a number of light calves.

A variable market trend in the young cattle with the quality through the grades having some effect on averages. Restocker vealer steers sold at firm rates. The trade heifer vealers sold to a cheaper trend, down 10c/kg. Yearling steers, all of which were purchased by restocker and feeder interests, saw the feeder grades remain firm and the restocker grades sell slightly dearer. The yearling heifers offered lacked the overall quality of last week and sold to a dearer trend, up 3c to 5c/kg.

The light calves estimated to weigh from 100kg to 160kg were sold open auction and made from $120 to $320/head.

The increased numbers of grown cattle attracted an extra processor into the market. This combined with a good offering of heavy cows and bullocks resulted in a dearer trend. The heavy steers and bullocks were 8c to 10c/kg dearer. Grown heifers sold dearer, up 2c to 6c/kg. The best heavy cow grades sold 4c/kg dearer. Medium weight 3 and 4 score cows dearer by 1c to 3c/kg. Restockers were active on the plainer condition cows pushing those grades up by 6c to 8c/kg. The best heavy bulls followed the dearer trend, up 4c to 8c/kg."
"The numbers remained the same at 325 head. All categories represented with yearlings in the majority. Quality was mixed with condition fair to very good. Restockers and feedlots were active while there was restricted processor competition for export cattle.

Strong restocker demand saw light weight yearling steers sell to dearer trends. Breed, quality and weight variations accounted for a large range in prices. Medium and heavy weights sold to considerably dearer trends with strong competition, particularly for the medium weights. Yearling heifers also posted strong gains with lightweight highly sought by restockers. There was increased feedlot competition on the medium and heavy weights.

Heavy grown steers to feed sold to dearer trends with breed a factor. Well finished grown heifers also dearer. There were some very good heavy weight cows penned, they attracted weaker competition to sell to cheaper trends. The return of a Northern processor after a long absence saw competition for bulls very strong this resulted in trends that were significantly dearer.

Market reporter, James Armitage."
"The numbers remained steady. The low numbers a reflection of the outstanding season being experienced, negating the need to offload livestock early. All categories had a representation with quality fair to good. Condition was also good for the most part. There was a restricted presence of processors and feedlotters with local restockers active.

The increased supply of vealers sold strongly with all going to restocker orders. Medium weight yearling steers sold on a firm to cheaper market trend with quality a factor in price change. There were a few heavy weight yearling steers that attracted restocker competition only. They also sold strongly taking breed and quality into account. Limited supplies of yearling heifers sold on a firm to cheaper trend. 

The lack of processor competition resulted in cheaper trends through all categories of grown cattle. The heavy weight cows only slightly cheaper.

Market Reporter3, James Armitage."
"The numbers remained steady with young cattle and cows well supplied, while there were few in the other categories. Quality and condition showed a great variation in all categories. The usual processors were in attendance however there was a little less feedlot competition. Once again restockers were active on the lightere weight cattle with more competition from the western areas.

There were varying trends through the young cattle where quality was also a factor. Steer vealers to restock averaged cheaper prices with both quality and  breed accounting for that. Heifer vealers to restock and feed saw a dearer trend of 9c to 12c/kg and more in places. Lightweight yearling steers to restock and feed experience strong gains. Medium weights to feed also sold to a slightly dearer trend however there was some quality related change. Yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend and once again quality played a part in any negative price change.

There were no heavy grown steers to quote. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, upto 10c/kg. There were significant price gains in the cow market with the best heavyweights upto 11c/kg dearer while the lessor quality cows saw greater improvement."
"The numbers remained steady with vealers and cows making up the bulk of the offering. The quality and condition was very mixed with most cattle in condition to suit restockers rather than processing. The regular buyers were in attendance. Recent rain and the forecast for more saw restocker demand increase. 

Steer weaners sold to a dearer trend, up 8c to 18c/kg. The dearer trend carried into the heifer weaners to restock with those improving by 6c to 8c/kg. Vealers to the trade also sold to a dearer trend of 8c to 20c/kg with the increased restocker activity impacting. A fairly plain quality penning of light weight yearling steers sold to a cheaper trend. Breed was a factor in the 11c/kg price improvement for heavy yearling feeder steers. The trend was closer to 7c/kg dearer. A drop in quality saw light weight yearling heifers sell to a cheaper trend, while the medium and heavy weights suitable to feed, sold to firm to 12c dearer.

There were too few well finished grown steers and heifers to quote. Plain condition cows were plentiful and attracted competition from restockers with crops either in the ground or up. The market trend saw little change. Well finished cows to process sold to a slightly cheaper trend."
"The numbers remained steady with the overall quality of the offering fair to good. There was a good selection of young cattle suitable to both the trade and to fatteners. There was an increased supply of heifer vealers as producers opt out and keep the steer portion for later. Yearling steers were plentiful, while heifer yearling numbers were down. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market that saw young cattle sell well and heavy cattle ease.

Vealers sold at firm rates both to the processors and to restockers. There was very strong restocker and feedlot demand for yearling steers with the light and medium weight steers selling to a dearer trend, up 3c to 4c/kg. Heavy feeder steers attracted much stronger competition to record a dearer trend of 8c to 10c/kg. Yearling heifers to restock and feed remained firm. The heifer yearlings to the trade sold slightly cheaper on the plainer condition grades and firm for the well finished lots. The well finished yearling heifers also showed an overall improvement in quality.

The heavy steers and bullocks did not show the overall quality of the previous weeks offering. This had some effect on values with the trend also cheaper. The smaller offering of cows could not maintain the level of the previous market with all grades showing a cheaper trend, down 3c to 4c/kg. The average quality of the medium and heavy 3 and 4 score cows was slightly better, accounting for the slight increase in average prices."
"The numbers remained steady with good rainfalls across the district slowing supply. Young cattle and cows made up the majority of the offering with quality and condition fair to very good. There was reduced processor attendance while restocker activity was high. 

High demand from those restocker orders resulted in dearer threads through all classes of yearlings. Light weight steers sold to a significantly dearer trends breaking the $4per kilogram barrier for the first time in a long while. The medium and heavy weight steers also posted strong gains however not as much as the light weights. Yearlings heifers also sold to much dearer trends under strong demand with price gains not as great as those of the steers.

No heavy grown steers to quote. Grown heifers to process sold to dearer trends with the reduced processor attendance having little effect. A very strong cow market saw the well finished heavy weights sell to a dearer trend of 20c to 30c/kg. Heavy bulls to meat works sold to a cheaper trend under reduced competition."
"The numbers remained steady with cows well supplied including a herd dispersal of mixed age cows in plainer condition. There was a good supply of young cattle while well finished grown cattle apart from cows and bulls to suit processors were in limited supply. There was extra feedlot competition while the full compliment of processors were in attendance.

Restocker and feedlot demand was strong through the young cattle with weaners returning to the paddock selling to significantly dearer trends. Availability reduced following a run of big weaner sales. The increased competition impacted medium and heavy weight yearlings positively with the market trend for steers substantially dearer. The heifer portion also sold to dearer trends however the improvement was not as great.

Strong demand from both restockers and processors was strong for cows. The dispersal cows having run continuously with bulls. They sold to a slightly dearer trend. With the number of cows in the system reducing competition from processors was strong on the well finished lots. They sold to a dearer trend of as much as 13c/kg. Heavy bulls were also keenly sort after to show a significantly dearer trend."
"The numbers remained steady with all grades represented. The quality of the offering was mixed while condition was mostly plain and well finished cattle were in limited numbers. The cold weather continues to strip condition, particularly from young cattle. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market that saw quality the major variable.

The quality of the vealer steers to restockers was responsible for the cheaper trend with values down by 5c/kg. It was the same scenario with heifer vealers with 2 scores to process and restock showing falls of 15c to 18c/kg. The small number of 3 score trade vealer heifers remained firm. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw light and medium weights sell to a cheaper trend, down 2c to 8c/kg with some quality issues. The heavyweight yearling steers sold up to 3c/kg dearer. The good supply of heifer yearlings sold firm to 3c/kg dearer to both the trade and feed.

Heavy steers sold cheaper with quality down. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, up by as much as 6c/kg. There was a very mixed quality offering of cows penned. The market saw very plain light cows sell at cheaper rates while the medium and heavy cows sold firm to 4c/kg dearer. There were very few good quality bulls on offer."
"The numbers remained steady with all categories represented. Young cattle made up the bulk of the penning with a few more vealers in the offering. The quality and condition was quite good with a reduced percentage of plainer quality and condition cattle. There was a similar buying group in attendance along with some extra feedlotter competition.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with steer vealers to restock up to 10c/kg. Some of that fall was related to weight. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw little change in the market trend with an odd pen of medium weights to restock slightly dearer. The better quality yearling heifers to restock and feed saw a firm to cheaper market trend with not as much competition. Plain quality and condition yearling heifers to restock in the light weight classes sold to a dearer trend with the dollar per head outlay being a consideration for buyers.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend with the majority being purchased by feedlotters. Well finished grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend with reduced processor demand. There were some good quality cows penned with market trends dearer by 3c to 5c/kg and more in places. The competition for bulls was not as fierce with the market trend up to 6c/kg cheaper."
"The numbers remained steady with 1020 head penned. There was a mixed quality penning of young cattle with some better quality vealer and yearling steers available. Cows carrying plenty of condition were well supplied. There was reduced processor participation in the grown cattle while there were several new restocker orders originating from the North.

An increased supply of good quality vealer steers sold to restockers at a dearer trend. The heifer portion however sold to a considerably cheaper trend.quality improvements saw the medium weight yearling steers average higher on a dearer market trend. Heavy weights were much cheaper with quality a factor also. Demand was weaker through the yearling heifers to restock with trends cheaper throughout.

Despite reduced processor activity heavy grown steers remained firm with an odd dearer sale. Well finished grown. Heifers sold on a firm to cheaper trend. The fortnight between sales saw the reduced competition cheapen the cow market by as much as 20c/kg with bulls following a similar trend."
"The numbers remained steady for the last sale for the year. There was a good supply of calves and store condition cows. Limited supplies of well finished cattle. Overall the quality of the offering varied from plain to good. There was restricted export processor competition and no domestic trade competition. Restocker and feedlot attendance was good.

Strong demand for light weight calves from restockers resulted in dearer trends of 25c/kg and more in places. Trends through the yearlings varied with the good quality steers dearer. The plainer quality steers and most of the heifers sold to cheaper trends with quality contributing.

Strong competition from restocker and feedlot interests resulted in the medium weight cows selling to a dearer trend. The light and very light weight cows sold to cheaper trends. The restricted processor competition saw the well finished cows and the heavy bulls sell to a much cheaper market trend."
"The numbers remained similar, with young cattle and cows making up the bulk of the offering. The quality of the offering was fair to good with some well finished cattle evident through all grades. Not all regular buyers were in attendance, with this more evident in the feeder cattle.

The market for young cattle showed variable trends. Vealer steers to restockers sold firm to 2c/kg dearer. Heifer vealers to restockers suffered with the limited competition to show a cheaper trend, down 6c to 9c/kg. The limited number of well finished 3 score vealers experienced greater falls. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold to a cheaper trend, with limited competition, down 2c to 9c/kg. Yearling heifers to restockers and feeders sold to a cheaper trend, down 6c to 8c, while a limited supply of trade 3 scores sold dearer up 10c/kg.

Heavyweight steers of varying age sold at firm rates as did the grown heifers. The cow market was strong through all grades, particularly plain condition cows; they improved by 9c/kg. The medium and heavyweight cows sold firm to 3c dearer."
"The numbers remained similar with vealers once again dominating supply. Cows and yearling heifers were also in fair numbers with a limited supply of heavy grown steers. There was a much smaller buying gallery with quite a number of regular orders not in attendance. The quality throughout all grades was mixed, but included some very good lots.

The market trend for steer vealers to restock was cheaper with the lighter weights least affected, down 2c/kg. The heavier weights were down an average of 8c/kg with quality contributing. Heifer vealers suffered from a drop in competition to show a much cheaper market trend, down 10c to 14c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend with some breed quality related price variations. Heavyweights to restockers were down 6c/kg with little competition from feedlotters. Heifer yearlings suffered greatly from a lack of trade competition to record significant losses.

Heavy grown steers remained firm. The cow market was cheaper with demand weaker from processors. Restocker activity underpinned the plainer condition cows to an extent. The overall market trend was down 4c to 7c/kg. Bulls sold to a much cheaper trend."
"The numbers remained similar to last week with yearlings, cows and an increased number of very good heavyweight steers making up the bulk of the penning. The quality was fair to good as was the condition. There was a bigger percentage of crop finished cattle. Most regular orders were in operation.

The young cattle market was quite strong although the light grades, both steers and heifers sold to a cheaper trend. It should also be noted that weights in these grades were greater than the cattle last week. This was the case for both restocker and trade yearlings. The medium weight yearling steers to restockers sold dearer for quality. Trade yearling heifers in the medium and heavyweight grades sold to a dearer trend, up 2c to 4c/kg.

The increased numbers of grown steers included some very good medium and heavyweights. The market saw little change remaining firm. The cow market experienced a bit of variation with the plainer cows showing a slightly cheaper trend and the better conditioned cows firm to dearer. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"The numbers remained similar to last week in what was a fairly plain condition offering. Yearlings and cows were predominant with insufficient heavy steers to quote. All other categories were represented although numbers were limited. All regular orders were in place as well as plenty of restocker competition.

The young cattle market showed a cheaper trend throughout with most of the steer yearlings and the biggest percentage of heifer yearlings going to restockers. A small number of heifer vealers sold firm. The lightweight yearling steers sold 5c to 10c/kg cheaper with no attention paid to muscle definition, as weight was the important factor. The yearling heifers to both restock and to the trade sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 13c with the majority of the heifers plainer in condition.

There were insufficient heavyweight steers to quote. The grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 6c and more in places with the plainest quality cattle most affected. A very small number of the best cows remained unchanged with the balance of the cow offering selling to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 8c, while heavyweight bulls remained firm."
"The numbers remained similar despite no rain and this being the second last sale for the year. The quality of the offering was very mixed as was the condition. The percentage of plain condition cattle continued to increase, although there were some well finished cattle presented. Young cattle made up the biggest percentage of the offering, there were very few well finished heavy steers while cows were in fair numbers. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market that saw a cheaper trend throughout.

Vealers and calves sold cheaper, down 6c to 10c/kg. A very small number of medium and heavy trade vealers were the least affected. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw the better quality lots 4c to 11c/kg cheaper while plain quality cattle experienced much greater falls. C muscle heifer yearlings to restock and feed sold 8c to 15c cheaper with the lightly muscled heifers showing falls of 25c to 35c/kg. Trade heifers followed a similar trend.

Heavy steers sold 4c to 6c/kg cheaper. Plain quality and condition steers carrying little weight for age sold to restockers at much cheaper rates. Grown heifers sold to processors 10c to 20c/kg cheaper while plain light heifers experienced greater falls. The cow market followed the trend, easing by 6c to 14c/kg."
"The numbers remain low which is typical for this time of year. The quality offered was mixed with some well finished yearlings along side numbers of plainer grades. Yearlings made up the bulk of the penning with limited numbers of the other grades. As to be expected with the low numbers not all regular buyers were in attendance, although this had little effect on the market.

The young cattle market was best described as variable. Restocker and feeder orders were not as enthusiastic given the current climate. The lighter end of the yearling steers tended cheaper as buyers were looking for heavyweights to finish earlier. The medium weight grades sold slightly dearer with quality a contributing factor. Light trade heifer yearlings sold to a dearer trend, up 2c to 6c/kg while restocker and feeder heifers were cheaper by a similar margin.

The grown steers penned mostly went to restockers at rates firm to slightly dearer, quality the main reason for the rise in value. There were a very small number of cows and they sold at firm rates."
"The numbers reduced once again and Agents expect a further drop in numbers each week from now on. Quality in the yarding was the same as last week with most cattle showing a winter sign. Cows made up one third of the yarding. The young cattle in most categories were well represented but heavy steers and bullocks were again light supplied. Weaner steers are starting to become less plentiful but the breed quality is being maintained.

The market for most young cattle was again stronger with heifer vealers and yearling trade heifers all gaining price. Yearling steers bought by restockers as well as trade steers were fully firm but steer weaner prices were not maintained following last sales strong showing. 

The export cattle all sold to a dearer trend. Heavy steers and the few light bullocks sold to 6c/kg dearer while the plainer types were unchanged. The heavy cow market was dearer by 10c while the medium and lighter cows sold dearer by 10 to 13c/kg. The better bulls in the yard were dearer but plain types only just made it to firm.

The top price in the market was 204.8c/kg for lightweight steer weaners bought to restock."
"The numbers reduced in the lead up to the end of the financial year. The quality of the offering was fair to good although the condition of the yarding reflected the cold weather. There were not as many vealer cattle, with cows and yearlings plentiful. There were also a number of good heavy steers. All regular buyers were in attendance.

Restocker and feeder orders were active, particularly on the young steers. Vealer steers were firm to 8c dearer, while the yearling steers were generally unchanged. There were some quality issues affecting values. The female offering met weaker competition from processors, particularly vealers and weaners as a result in a drop in yield. Vealer heifers were cheaper, down 1c to 7c/kg. The yearling heifer market was under pinned by feeder orders, the market generally unchanged.

Increased numbers of heavy steers along with a small improvement in quality saw a dearer market, up 2c/kg. The grown heifers met weaker competition as a result of plainer quality, selling to a cheaper trend. 

The cow market saw little change through most grades although odd sales of heavy cows were slightly dearer, quality also lifting some values."
"The numbers more than doubled, with an influx of late weaners and light weight yearlings. There were limited supplies in other categories, however there were in excess of 40 head of bulls. The quality of the young cattle was very mixed, which changed the appearance of the offering as there were good lines available. The majority of the young cattle were on the lower end of the fat score range. There were a few well finished heavy steers and heifers, with a small number of 3 and 4 score cows. The usual buyers attended, with strong competition from all sectors.

Going into spring there was strong demand from restockers for light weight weaner and yearling steers. Due to an average improvement in quality there were substantial price rises in most classes, with the better quality lines experiencing the greatest improvement. On the other end of the scale, the plain quality steers were difficult to sell. There were insufficient steers in the heavier weight classes to compare a quote. There was less demand for light weight heifers returning to the paddock, as such the market showed cheaper trends. Yearling heifers deemed suitable to feed sold 25c/kg dearer, compared to the sale a fortnight ago.

Processor demand for well finished cattle was strong, with 3 and 4 score lines showing strong gains. The limited supply of well finished cows were up to 4c/kg dearer. The plainer condition cows showed a large variation in quality and this reflected in the price range. Heavy bulls were as much as 20c/kg dearer, with some improved quality higher yielding lots penned."
"The numbers more than doubled with an influx of young cattle. Vealers and yearlings were well supplied. There was also a good number of grown cattle. The quality of the offering was fair to very good, condition plain to very good, some of the heavy cows carrying an excess. There was a much larger gallery of buyers in attendance, in creasing competition across all classes.

The state of the market, combined with paddocks of fresh green feed saw restocker activity very high. Light weight vealer steers under 280kg sold to a significantly dearer market trend. The heifer portion following suit. Light weight yearling steers also sold to dearer trends posting strong gains. There was some breed and weight related price change. Medium and heavy weight yearling feeder steers sold well, however there was no market comparison available due to a lack of supply at the previous market. A large variation in breed and quality accounted for a big range of prices in the lighter weight yearling heifers. A line of very well bred heifers attracted strong restocker competition. Medium and heavy weights sold to a dearer trend with heavy trade posting significant improvement.

Grown steers to feed over 500kg attracted good competition, however there was nothing from the previous sale to compare the market to. Heavy weights to processors sold strongly under increased competition. Well finished grown heifers sold to dearer trends, both to feed and process. Increased competition in the cow market resulted in little change in trends. That increased competition saw the bull market improve.

Market reporter, James Armitage"
"The numbers more than doubled on last weeks very small offering. The quality and condition varied from fair to good. There were some very good crop fattened cattle, alongside lines of plain condition yearlings. Grown cattle were in limited numbers to slaughter and there were a number of heavy feeder steers offered.

The larger numbers meant buyers were able to secure reasonable lines. This had a positive effect on the young cattle market in particular. The market for all grades was dearer. Restockers were very active on yearlings with little regard shown for muscle definition, as long as the quality was suitable. Light and medium weight steers were dearer up 10c to 30c/kg.There were no heifer yearlings to compare to last week although restockers were active. Processors were very keen to purchase light and medium weight heifers as supplies remain tight, particularly lightweights. The market showed a much stronger trend.

There were only a small number of heavy steers suitable to slaughter, these selling to a dearer trend. Most of the grown steers were suitable to feed on with the quality improved on recent weeks with the market strong. Once again cow numbers were limited, the market firm to a shade cheaper."
"The numbers more than doubled however still remain low. PTE females made up a large percentage of the offering while weaners were in limited supply. The local weaner sales being in full swing no doubt a factor. The quality and condition of the offering was mixed with a few good yearling restocker and feeder cattle along with some very good heavy steers and cows. Not all regular buyers were in attendance.

A relatively strong market for young cattle with the weaner steers to restockers generally selling to a firm trend with quality related price change. The heifer portion sold to a significantly dearer trend with quality also contributing to some strong gains. Yearlings sold to dearer trends with heavy feeder steers recovering all of the losses from the previous sale. Heifers were keenly sought by restockers and feedlots to post strong gains. The secondary quality lots struggled to attract much competition with this reflected in prices paid.

With large rainfalls forecast processors competed strongly for all classes of well finished grown cattle and cows in an effort to have cattle on hand in case of cancellations due to that rain. Heavy grown steers sold to a substantially dearer trend. The cow market improved by 20c to 30c/kg with restockers active on the plainer condition lines in competition with processors. The well finished cows attracted strong competition with little concern for excess fat cover. Bulls were also considerably dearer."
"The numbers lifted to 1365 head with another large offering of cows. There were some very good heavy weight grown steers and a mixed quality penning of young cattle. There was reduced restocker and feedlot competition. The regular processors were in attendance.

Demand was weaker through the young cattle with restockers showing some restraint heading into Winter. Vealer steers to restockers sold to a considerably cheaper trend while the heifer portion even more affected. A very mixed quality penning of heavy yearling steers were significantly cheaper with the secondary grades most affected. Medium weight yearling heifers held up well to show little change while the heavy weights were cheaper.

Well finished grown steers and bullocks sold to a substantially cheaper trend with those carrying an excess of condition most affected. There were also weight issues with some very heavy steers penned. The well finished grown heifers followed similar trends. The best of the cows saw a cheaper trend of as much as 40c/kg on a fortnight ago with processors over supplied. There was weaker demand for bulls with trends much cheaper."
"The numbers increased with vealers, yearling heifers and cows in fair numbers, while all other categories were limited in supply. All regular buyers were in attendance and restocker orders were strong. The quality and condition varied.

Vealer steers to the restockers sold to a dearer trend, up 6c to 9c/kg on the light and medium weights. The heavier weights also showed improvement, up by 1c/kg. Heifer vealers to the restockers sold to a dearer trend, up 2c/kg. There was some evidence that restockers were looking to purchase cattle in forward condition. A plainer quality and smaller offering of yearling steers sold at cheaper rates for the light and medium weights while the heavyweight steers to restock and feed improved in value. Yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, up to 6c/kg. Once again buyers were looking to secure heifers in forward condition with a shorter turn around.

The limited supply of heavy steers sold 3c/kg dearer. Very strong restocker demand saw cows to the paddock sell to a dearer trend, up to 8c/kg. This demand carried through to the cows to slaughter with the market firm to 9c/kg dearer. The biggest increase was on heavy cows showing high yields."
"The numbers increased with the inclusion of numbers of late vealers. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering with very few grown cattle, in fact bull numbers out number cows. All regular orders were in place to compete for a plain condition offering where restockers were well catered for. 

The quality of the vealer steers was fair with most carrying little weight. The market however was strong with buyers attracted by the lack of weight. The heifer portion, most of which sold to processors sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 4c/kg. Light yearling steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 7c/kg. The medium weights sold to a dearer trend, up 10c to 12c/kg with the quality improving also. Yearling heifers to the trade sold to a cheaper trend while those to restock remained firm.

There was a single pen of heavy grown steers that sold to a dearer trend although the improvement was quality related. 

The cow market showed a cheaper trend for the 31 that were penned while heavy bulls improved in quality and cheapened in value."
"The numbers increased with the inclusion of a line of lightweight yearling steers. The quality of the offering was mixed, while overall the condition of the young cattle in particular suited restockers. There were a few well finished yearling heifers suitable to the trade. Cows were in fair numbers with some to suit all destinations. All regular processors were in attendance and there was a large gallery of restocker buyers.

The young cattle market was once again strong, driven by restockers with an abundance of feed. A small number of vealers sold strongly, although no market comparison is available. Light weight yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend with the C muscle category up 17c/kg. The average quality improvement also contributed to this rise. The very light D muscle steers to restock saw a larger increase in prices. There was little change in the few medium and heavyweights. The trend was similar for lightweight yearling heifers both to the trade and restockers.

No heavy steers at the previous sale, making a market comparison difficult. The cow market was once again buoyed by restocker demand with suitable cows up to 6c/kg dearer. The well finished cows to process sold 1c to 4c/kg cheaper."
"The numbers increased with the inclusion of a large run of light weight yearlings. Overall the quality of the yarding was very mixed with some very well bred local cattle and quite a few secondary quality agistment yearlings. The condition of the offering was also mixed. There was very little feedlot and processor activity however restockers were active throughout.

Heavy weight vealer steers to restockers sold on a firm to dearer market trend with some quality related price change. The heifer portion much cheaper. Light weight yearling steers to restockers sold to a significantly dearer trend, taking breed and quality into account. The medium weights sold to cheaper trends with both breed and quality contributing to price change. The heavy weights saw those to feed sell to a cheaper trend, while those to restockers were dearer. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers posted strong gains on a dearer market trend taking quality into account. Medium and heavy weights saw trends mostly cheaper.

Heavy grown steers sold to cheaper trends with restricted processor and feedlot competition. Heavy weight cows also sold to a cheaper trend of as much as 19c/kg under limited processor competition.

Market reporter; James Armitage."
"The numbers increased with a good supply of young cattle and cows while heavyweight grown steers were in limited numbers. The quality and condition of the yarding was fair to good. All regular processor and feeder buyers were in place and operating and there was good competition from an increased field of restocker buyers. Demand was strong for all categories except vealers to processors.

Vealer steers to restockers sold firm to 5c/kg dearer. Vealers to processors, both steers and heifers sold to a cheaper trend, up to 16c/kg as supplies increase. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders averaged firm with odd sales either side of firm. Demand for yearling heifers both to feeders and to processors was strong, the market remained firm to 2c dearer.

Heavyweight steers and grown heifers sold at unchanged rates. The cow market saw strong demand from restockers and processors for plain condition cows, with the trend 3c to 9c/kg dearer. Medium weight 3 score cows sold slightly cheaper, while the heavyweights remained firm with odd better quality cows slightly dearer."
"The numbers increased with 464 head on offer. Yearlings, cows and grown heifers were well supplied with limited supplies in the other categories. Overall the quality and condition was good. There were a few plainer quality and conditioned lots. An increased gallery of buyers were in attendance.

High demand combined with the extra competition resulted in dearer trends through most classes of young cattle. The good quality lightweight yearling steers to restockers posted strong gains. Medium and heavy weights to restock and feed were also keenly sought with increased competition. Dearer trends through the yearling heifers with feeder weights showing the greatest improvement.Quality variations did limited increases in averages in some cases.

Heavy grown steers to feed sold to dearer trends while there were limited supplies to suit the processors. The grown heifers carried plenty of condition for the most part attracting strong processor competition, market trends however showed little change. The big lift in the market was on cows with trends upwards of 30c/kg dearer.Heavy bulls showed a small improvement.

Market reporter. James Armitage"
"The numbers increased to their highest level in 5 years. In a recurring theme, vealers and cows were offloaded in large numbers. Quality was very mixed, particularly in the yearlings. There were some very good quality vealers penned. Large numbers of very plain condition cows and limited supplies of well finished cattle in any category. There was reduced processor and feedlot competition. There was an increased presence of southern restocker and feedlot interests.

Market trends through the young cattle were cheaper, as feedlots reach capacity and restockers show caution. Steer vealers to restockers sold to cheaper trends of 20c to 40c/kg, with large price variations between breed and quality. The heifer portion followed a similar trend and more in places. There was limited trade competition. A very mixed quality penning of yearling steers saw trends cheaper. The better quality lines were least affected, while secondary quality steers attracted limited demand. A small number of well finished yearling heifers to the trade sold to a slightly dearer trend. Heifers to restock and feed were cheaper.

The limited supply of grown steers suitable to processors averaged cheaper, with a reduction in quality. The cow market was much cheaper through all categories. Once again, processors at capacity and restockers limited somewhat by feed and water issues. Trends were 20c to 30c/kg cheaper and more in places. There was little change in the bull market."
"The numbers increased to their highest level for quite sometime. There was a good supply of heavy weight cows with young cattle also well supplied. The quality of the offering was mixed, while there were plenty of well finished cattle to suit processor requirements. There was strong restocker support with feedlots and processors also very active.

The strong demand from restockers continued with vealers selling to dearer trends. The light and medium weights improving by as much 20c to 40c/kg. The light weight heifer portion improving b y a greater margin. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed mostly sold to cheaper trends. Odd quality related price improvement. Well finished trade yearling heifers sold to dearer trends as did the feeder heifers.

Heavy grown steers to process sold to dearer trends with the heifer portion also showing strong gains. Quality and increased competition were factors. There was little change in the medium weight cows. Heavy weights sold to dearer trends of as much as 18c/kg under increased competition and an improvement in quality. Heavy weight bulls sold to dearer trends."
"The numbers increased to a more acceptable level at Armidale today, allowing easier comparisons to be made. Even though the offering was not big, the quality was fair to good with a run of well finished, crop fattened, light bullocks a feature of the sale.There were enough cows to provide comparisons and the balance of the yarding was made up of yearlings and weaners, quite a percentage of which went back to restockers.

Competition was again strong and steady with all the usual buyers attending.

Light heifer vealers and yearlings sold well at increased rates, while restocker steers and weaners met very good enquiry to sell at well improved prices. There is no sign of any weakening in any class of young stock.

Export steers and light bullocks sold at very consistent values, but comparisons  are not possible as there were none available at last weeks small sale. Sales in the north this week have all shown an improving trend for suitable export steers and bullocks. The upward trend in the cow market was again evident with numbers still at very low levels and demand therefore reaching higher levels each week. The demand from growers for cows to fatten appears to be increasing as the price of replacement steers escalates and supply diminishes.

The bull market held fairly steady, but the average quality was not very high."
"The numbers increased this week in what was a mixed quality offering. There were some very good crop and pasture fattened lots along with plenty of plainer conditioned grades. All grades were represented with cows making up 25% of the yarding. All regular buyers were in attendance.

Market trends showed a bit of variation through the young cattle. Restocker vealer steers saw the lightweights sell to a dearer trend, while the medium weights sold cheaper. Heifer vealers to resockers sold to a cheaper trend, although the quality was not quite as good. Heifer vealers to the trade sold firm to slightly cheaper. Most of the yearling steers went to restockers at rates dearer than last week, with some lots showing a quality improvement. For the most part though quality remained the same. Trade yearling heifers remained generally firm with some quality variations.

Heavyweight steers sold firm with the younger 2 tooth steers at the top of the price range. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 5c/kg with the best being well finished 2 tooths. Plain conditioned lightweight cows sold to a cheaper trend while the better conditioned cows started out firm and strengthened throughout the sale to finish 2c to 3c/kg dearer. Heavyweight bulls also sold to a dearer trend."
"The numbers increased this week after last weeks rain affected reduction. The overall quality and condition of the yarding was best described as fair to good. There were numbers of both well finished and plain conditioned cattle throughout all categories. Most grades were represented with plenty of grown heifers, yearlings and vealers.

The market trend for young cattle was dearer, however they were some quality related price reductions. Restocker vealer steers were firm to 8c/kg dearer. The light trade heifer vealers were 15c to 18c/kg dearer. Medium weight heifer vealers to the trade were 3c to 5c/kg dearer. Trade yearlings were firm to 6c dearer, while the restocker and feeder yearlings were 1c to 9c/kg dearer.

Grown cattle met keen competition with all grades showing improved market trends. Heavy steers, generally showing better quality were 7c to 15c/kg dearer, with increased numbers of younger types offered. Increased numbers of grown heifers also met stronger demand from both processors and feedlots with prices 6c to 8c/kg dearer. There were very few light cows in the yarding, most falling into the medium weight range. Those medium weight cows saw prices improve by 6c to 8c/kg. The heavy weight cows improved in value by 2c to 3c/kg."
"The numbers increased in the wake of a few very good frosts over the past week. All grades were represented in a yarding that had an increased supply of finished cattle off crop. The overall quality of the offering was fair to good. All the usual buyers were in attendance with the market strong for most categories.

Vealer steers to restock sold unchanged as did the heifer vealers going to the paddock. Vealers to the trade were firm to dearer. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold firm to dearer with light weights to the paddock experiencing the best of the market. An improved quality and condition of yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend, down as much as 10c/kg. Heifers to feed sold generally firm, however there were isolated sales showing a dearer trend.

Heavy steers sold to a dearer trend, improving by 3c to 5c/kg. The large offering of cows resulted in plain condition cows sell to a cheaper trend, both to processors and restockers. The well finished medium and heavy cows sold to a dearer trend of 3c to 5c/kg."
"The numbers increased in an offering that saw all grades represented. Once again vealers were in the greatest numbers although there was evidence that the best lots have been offloaded. The condition of the offering was only fair with the quality quite good. All regular buyers were in attendance.

Vealer steers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend, of 6c to 11c/kg,but there were isolated sales that experienced a slightly small price fall. Generally the vealer steers lacked bloom. As far as the heifer vealers  were concerned it was a similar story with bloom and condition, only isolated pens showing freshness. Despite this the market remained unchanged on last week except for a small number of 3 score vealers, they were slightly cheaper. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders were firm. Heifer yearlings, most of which went to restockers remained unchanged.

Limited numbers of heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, easing up to 7c/kg with quality only fair. Grown heifers 2 or more teeth sold at slightly improved rates for quality. The cow market remained fully firm. There was quite a large offering of fairly plain bulls, they sold a shade dearer."
"The numbers increased from the last sale prior to christmas. Young cattle made up the biggest percentage of the offering with the first of the vealers on display. There were fair numbers of grown heifers and cows while good quality heavyweight steers were in very short supply. Not all regular buyers were in attendance, particularly noticeable on export grades.

A solid start to the new year for young cattle. All grades sold up to or slightly better than pre- christmas levels. The majority of the yearling steers were purchased by restocker and feedlot interests. All of the heifer vealers sold to processors at rates equal to the previous sale. Restockers and feedlots were also active on yearling heifers with only the over conditioned and plain quality grades going to the trade.

The grown steers were mostly light and medium weights of plain quality and condition and sold according to quality. Grown heifers with 2 teeth sold well, mostly to feed while the older heifers sold to a cheaper trend. The cow market suffered from restricted competition and market forces to show a much cheaper trend, down by 12c to 15c/kg across all grades. Bulls also sold to a cheaper trend."
"The numbers increased due to increased numbers of vealer steers, vealer heifers and yearling steers . Cows were well supplied while there were limited numbers of heavy steers in the offering. Quality was fair to good although the condition of the yarding saw few trade cattle on offer. The majority of the cow offering carried sufficient cover for processors. Not all export operators were in attendance although this seemingly had little effect on the market.

The young cattle offering saw most steer vealers return to restockers at improved rates on last week. The market trend was dearer by 2c to 4c, restockers paying premiums for particular breeds with quality important. Heifer vealers were in greater numbers, most going to processors with a small number of 3 scores going to butchers. The market recovered some of last weeks fall being firm to dearer, up to 5c/kg. The yearling steer offering was of plainer quality, once again the majority returning to the paddock or to feed yards at cheaper rates, down 5c to 8c/kg. Yearling heifers both trade and feeders sold to a dearer trend, firm to 6c/kg up.

Limited numbers of heavy steers sold to a dearer trend, up 2c/kg. The cow market was reasonably solid with restocker cows generally unchanged. Medium and heavy cows to processors sold firm to slightly easier, down 1c to 2c/kg."
"The numbers increased by more than double. There was a fair supply of young cattle, however grown cattle and cows made up the bulk of the penning. The quality of the offering was fair to good with some well bred lines of young cattle available. There was plenty of condition on offer, particularly through the older steers, heifers and cows. The increased supply brought with it an increase in buyers who operated throughout. The big rain in the North putting pressure on supply brought about the return of 2 major processors after a long absence.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with restocker activity high on the lighter end of the vealer steers selling to a dearer trend, while the heavier weights were cheaper. The increased competition saw medium and heavy weight yearling steers sell to dearer trends. A very mixed quality penning of yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends, some significant falls shown.

Heavy weight grown steers attracted competition from processors and also bullock fatteners. Market trends were dearer as a result. Well finished grown heifers sold to cheaper trends despite extra competition. The cow market also experienced a cheaper trend,. The increased competition however was reflected in the bull market where demand was high. The market for heavy weight bulls was significantly dearer.

Market reporter; James Armitage."
"The numbers increased by 400 head in a yarding that saw yearlings, grown heifers and a big increase in cow numbers make up the bulk. There were also quite a few bulls penned. Not all regular slaughter orders were in place as some works wind down into the christmas break. The restocker and feedlot orders were active as usual.

The young cattle market was reasonably strong, albeit most grades seeing a cheaper trend. Lightweight yearling steers to restockers saw the better quality C muscle grades sell cheaper, down 5c to 8c with odd sales a little more. Some of the light plain condition and quality steers actually sold dearer with buyers looking at the dollar value. Lightweight 2 score heifer yearlings to feeders sold to a dearer trend under some spirited bidding, they were up 2c to 4c, this trend carrying over on to the light trade heifers. The medium and heavyweight yearling heifers with milk teeth sold to a cheaper trend.

There was not the competition on the heavy steers, with the market trend cheaper down 2c to 6c/kg. The grown heifers were also cheaper, down 1c to 3c with quite a few going to the feed pens. The cow market showed a variable market trends with the better yielding cows managing to hold their value. It was the middle run of cows with lower yields that experienced a weaker market, down as much as 10c/kg."
"The numbers increased as producers took an opportunity to offload on what has been a rising market. There was a good supply of well finished heavy weight cattle including cows. There were also quite a few cattle showing the effects of winter with feed quality not as good. There was a mixed quality penning of young cattle. The full field of processors along with an extra Southern cow buyer operated alongside the usual restocker and feedlot orders.

The majority of the young cattle saw dearer market trends with restockers active on lighter weights. The weaner steers improved by as much as 20c/kg in the fortnight while the heifer portion saw a greater improvement. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed also saw a dearer trend of 20c to 30c/kg. Light and medium weight yearling heifers showed little change with buyers showing a preference for steers. Heavy weight heifers suitable to feed attracted keen competition and sold to a dearer trend. Quality was the major factor in any negative price change through the young cattle.

Well finished heavy weight steers over 500kg sold to dearer trends with processor competition strong. The well finished grown heifers followed a similar trend. Heifers suitable to feed with potential to carry plenty of weight met with increased demand. Well finished cows under high demand and increased competition sold to a significantly dearer trend. The plain condition cows also posted strong gains with restockers also active. Heavy bulls sold to dearer trends."
"The numbers halved which was somewhat surprising given there is no sale next week. The start of the annual weaner sales also contributed to a reduction in numbers. The quality of the offering was quite mixed, while the best of the condition was reserved for heavy weight cows. There was reduced processor and feedlot competition.

The quality of the weaners was well below the previous week and this was reflected in price. The market trend for both steer and heifer weaners to restockers was considerably cheaper. Despite the reduced feedlot competition the medium and heavy yearling feeder and restocker steers held up reasonably well. The medium weights remained firm, while there was a large variation in quality. The heavy weights saw a firm to cheaper market trend, up to 9c/kg in places with the better quality lots least affected. There were cheaper trends of 4c to 6c/kg through yearling heifers to restock and feed. There was also some quality related price change.

There were too few well finished heavy grown steers to quote. There was a further easing in the cow market with trends 8c to 11c\kg cheaper on the well finished medium and heavy weights. The plainer condition cows experienced greater redcutions."
"The numbers halved compared to the previous week as growers save weaners for the upcoming annual weaner sales. Quality was considerably better with most cattle fairly represented and weaner cattle showing the greatest percentage of those offered. Cows, which were in very big numbers last sale, were in a lesser supply and the average quality was also down. There were many pens of quality steer weaners yarded.

The trend in the young cattle market was firm to cheaper. Steer weaners to restockers sold to dearer prices but the difference was made up in the big improvement in quality. Heifer vealers varied very much but the average of sales was cheaper. Trade cattle were very few in number and sold at firm rates for the quality available. Light feeder steers were firm for the best quality but cheaper for plainer types.

The few bullocks yarded were slightly cheaper with yield not estimated to be very high. All cows also sold at easier rates with the light cows possibly the most affected. Export weight feeder steer were considerably cheaper under much reduced competition.

A feature was the sale of a pen of seven steer vealers all European breed cross that weighed well over 400kg and sold at 218.6c/kg to top all sales in the market."
"The numbers fell with a lot less cows on offer. The condition of the yarding was on the plain side with limited numbers of well finished trade vealers or yearlings. There were some good cows and heavy steers available. A feature of the offering was a line of 560 one brand yearling heifers in store condition. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market showing varying trends.

Lightweight vealer steers to restockers sold to a slightly cheaper trend, The heavier steer vealers were firm to 3c/kg dearer. Once again backgrounders were active on heifer vealers, making it difficult for processors to secure kill cattle at their rates. The market however was 3c to 5c/kg cheaper. Yearling steers to restock and feed benefited from increased competition to sell to a dearer trend, firm to 2c/kg up. The large offering of yearling heifers saw most go to feed at dearer rates, although the price improvement was aided by an overall improvement in quality. The 3 score heifers to the trade sold 2c/kg dearer.

A small number of very good quality heavy steers carrying milk and 2 teeth sold to a dearer trend, up 3c/kg. The older heavy steers lacked quality and yield and sold to a firm trend. The smaller offering of cows saw plain condition cows sell to restockers 2c/kg cheaper. The better condition cows to process sold to a slightly dearer trend."
"The numbers fell to their lowest level for sometime on the back of a rain event and a reasonable forecast going forward. It was a very mixed quality penning with condition showing  a similar variation. Numbers evenly split between the young cattle and grown cattle. The usual processors were in attendance and there was extra competition on export cattle.

Restocker competition was strong with confidence in the season somewhat restored. Trends were dearer for the most part while there was some quality related price change. The low numbers also played a role in price change with the 2 weeks between sales bringing substantial price improvement.

The increased processor competition contributed to dearer trends through the grown cattle. Quality was an issue for the negative price change on the small number of heavy grown steers. The well finished grown heifers posted strong gains while the plainer condition  grown heifers attracted both restocker and feedlot competition. The cow market was very strong with all classes showing significant improvement."
"The numbers fell by half in the face of good rain and a promising forecast. The quality of the offering was fair to good with all categories represented. There was a good supply of well finished cattle, reflecting the quality of seasonal conditions. Not all of the regular processors were represented. Restocker activity was good.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with the light weight yearling steers under 280kg selling on a firm to slightly dearer trend. The heavier weight classes saw mostly quality related price change with an odd dearer sale to restockers. There were similar trends in the yearling heifers, however quality variations did account for some substantial price change in some classes.

Heavy weight grown steers to feed sold to cheaper trends with reduced competition. The well finished lines to processors sold to a dearer trend of as much as 10c/kg with some improvement in quality. Well finished grown heifers also sold to a dearer trend. A good quality penning of heavy weight cows sold to a dearer trend of as much as 12c/kg. A breed specific restocker order created the high price for cows. Strong processor competition on some very good quality bulls resulted in significantly dearer market trends.

Market reporter, James Armitage"
"The numbers fell by almost 300 with this trend likely to continue until the end of the year. The quality of the offering was very mixed, with most well bred although there were some very plain quality cattle penned. The condition of the offering was also mixed with the majority showing the effects of the cold weather, there were however some very well finished pasture fattened yearling heifers and a number of cows carrying condition. Not all regular buyers were in attendance although this had little effect on the market. Demand was strong and the market good.

Restockers continue to drive the vealer steer market with all grades showing a dearer trend, medium weights 1c to 8c dearer while the plain lightweight grades experienced greater increases. Heifer vealers sold to a dearer trend, up 3c to 9c/kg with the market driven by processors looking to secure requirements as supply reduce. Yearling steers were well sought by both restockers and feedlotters to show a dearer trend of 3c to 9c/kg and more in places. The best money was paid by restockers with lightweight yearling heifers to feeders selling to a dearer trend, up 4c to 9c/kg. The increased numbers of well finished 3 score heifer yearlings had a negative effect on values with less pressure on buyers, the trend was cheaper, down 4c/kg.

The heavyweight steer offering saw quality below last week, this the major factor in a cheaper market. This trend continued through to the grown heifers. The quality of the cow offering was very mixed with this also the reason for variation in price on an otherwise firm market."
"The numbers fell below 1000 head for the first time in many months, signalling the normal slow down in numbers form here until christmas. Most grades were represented with cows making up almost 30% of the penning. The majority of the offering were showing signs of the winter, with yields on the decline. There were some good heavyweight steers and cows and not a lot of well finished young trade cattle. With the falling numbers not all regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market was reasonably strong taking the quality into account. Vealer steers, coming to the tail end of production sold to a slightly cheaper trend for the lightweights, while the heavyweights sold at slightly improved values. The heifer vealers sold to a cheaper trend, although overall the quality slipped. An isolated pen of good quality vealers sold a bit dearer to a restocker. Yearling steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend, while the limited numbers of suitable trade yearlings sold 2c to 3c/kg dearer, both steers and heifers.

Heavyweight steers sold firm to 3c/kg dearer, with the young steers seeing the best of the rise. Grown heifers remained firm. The cow offering saw quite a few plain conditioned lots available. This attracted good restocker demand which in turn created a dearer market trend, up 2c to 5c/kg. The better conditioned cows sold firm to cheaper with a noticeable drop in yields in some of the lots. The better yielding cows saw little change. Heavyweight bulls were well sought and sold to a dearer trend."
"The numbers fell back to the levels 2 weeks ago. The quality of the offering was generally good with fewer plain quality cattle penned. The condition varied throughout all grades with all buyers catered for. There was a good supply of young cattle and a fair penning of grown cattle. The market was strong throughout with a couple of new orders in operation. The lack of cattle in the North is pushing buyers South in an effort to secure a reasonable supply adding to competition.

Vealer steers sold to restockers at dearer rates, up 13c to 16c/kg. Demand for vealer heifers was very strong, regardless of weight or fat cover. The market trend was much dearer, up 18c to 22c/kg. This was the case with one regular buyer of vealers not operating. Yearling steers to restock and feed were also well sought, with light and medium weights showing a dearer trend of 5c to 13c/kg. The heavy yearling steers over 400kg attracted strong support from both feedlots and grass fatteners, the trend dearer by 4c to 10c/kg. Extra trade competition for yearling heifers saw the trend improve by 5c to 8c/kg on average with some sales showing greater improvement.

Heavy steers sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 7c with a much smaller premium evident for the younger 2 tooth steers, only 2c to 3c/kg. Grown heifers carrying their permanent teeth were 2c to 8c dearer while a fair to good quality offering of cows sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 7c/kg."
"The numbers fell away very considerably as they always do at this time every year and the smaller yardings are anticipated for the rest of the winter. Quality was similar to last sale with most types represented except for steer vealers to slaughter. Cows were in a slightly bigger proportion while feeder steers were in the biggest numbers in the yards.

The smaller sale was responsible for either a firm market or a dearer trend. Heifer vealers were fully firm while trade heifers showed a dearer trend. Restocker steers were fully firm, as were the lighter feeder steers. Some off types in the lighter feeder steers struggled to remain firm.

The bullocks in the yard were fair quality but did not exhibit a high yield potential. However their market remained fully firm. The cow market was very solid with no change visible. There was a dearer trend in the heavy export feeder steers with some but not all prices 6c/kg dearer. There was no change in the bull price.

The top price in the sale was the 192c/kg paid for heavyweight feeder steers."
"The numbers fell away in what was a fairly mixed quality offering. The condition of the yarding was also on the plain side with limited numbers of well finished young cattle and heavyweight steers. There were however some well finished heavyweight cows. The low numbers resulted in not all regular buyers attending although this had little effect on the market trends.

Quality and condition played a major part in the price variations seen through most of the young cattle grades. The actual market trends were generally firm. Restockers were active on the plainer conditioned cattle.

The grown cattle offering saw limited numbers of heavyweight steers sell at firm rates. The grown heifers were also firm while the brightest part of the market were the cows, they sold to a dearer trend, up 10c/kg on the better grades. Heavyweight bulls also sold to a dearer trend."
"The numbers dropped slightly. Female cattle made up a big percentage of the offering with cow, vealers and yearlings well supplied. As producers head toward the tail end of their sell off period, particularly for vealers, cow numbers increase. Overall the condition of the offering continued its decline with well finished young cattle few and far between. All regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market saw most grades show a firm to dearer trend. The cattle that struggled in the market were the plain quality lines; they sold to a cheaper trend through all grades. Vealer steers sold firm to 4c/kg dearer with all but an odd single going to restockers. Breed quality continues to dictate price variations. The heifer vealer market strengthened as the sale progressed finishing up firm with odd sales 1c to 2c/kg dearer. Limited numbers of yearling steers this week sold to a cheaper trend due to the quality of the offering, with most selling to restockers. There were some good lines of well bred heifer yearlings in the offering suitable to both the trade and feeders. The best quality and conditioned heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 2c to 4c/kg.

There were limited numbers of heavy steers this week, they sold close to firm. Cows dominated the grown cattle offering with a few better quality lines available this week. Also in the offering were a number of pens of PTIC cows. The market saw the better quality cows sell to a dearer trend, up 4c to 8c/kg. Restockers were active on the pregnant cows paying up to 137c for young cows. The penning of bulls suffered for quality with very few good bulls on offer."
"The numbers drawn for may not have eventuated due to heavy rain at receival time. Breed quality was very much better in a yarding which consisted to a large extent of feeder steers, weaner and yearling cattle. Restockers bought all the weaner steers and yearling steers. Bullocks and cows were in short supplied while trade heifers were in fair numbers but were only of average quality. Splitter vealers weighing under 200kg were in very low numbers, which is the opposite of the sales before the rain.

The market was extremely strong for all yearling and weaner steers going to restockers with prices rising very considerably as a result of the rain. Feeder steers in all weights met a much stronger market with even the lesser quality cattle selling at dearer prices. Light vealers both under and over 200kg also met keen enquiry and sold to a dearer price.

The quality of the few bullocks yarded was well above previous weeks, but even so the prices paid were above the previous sale. The cow market was dearer with the shortage in numbers being the prime reason for the rises. All weights of cows were dearer. There was a good demand also for the greater number of bulls yarded and the price rise was clearly due to the increase in demand.

The top price of the sale was for light weaner steers selling to restockers at 216.2c/kg"
"The numbers doubled with the prospect of an early Easter break coupled with the early autumn onset. There was quite a considerable improvement in the quality in all cattle with the greatest improvement shown in feeder steers and in restocker steer weaners. Most cattle except trade weights were in fair supply. All the usual buyers attended and there were extra buyers competing on light cattle and on bulls and light cows.

The trend over the market was mainly firm to dearer with the sole exception coming in some pens of light heifer vealers. Light feeder steers sold to higher prices but the major reason for the rise was that the quality was improved. The same situation applied with the good numbers of steer weaners bought by restockers. The trade heifers sold at dearer prices but there were not many available. Restocker yearling steers were  fully firm.

All export cattle sold at dearer prices but the bulk of the price rises could be attributed to the improvement in yield that was so very obvious. A feature of the sale was the 170.2c/kg paid for a pen of outstanding European cross cows. Heavy heifers to export also met a stronger demand to record price increases and the bull market was dearer and benefited from some extra competition.

The top sale price was 229.2c/kg paid for very light steer weaners to restock."
"The numbers doubled with increased consignments of weaners and yearlings. There was a fair supply of cows and a few well-finished grown steers and heifers. The quality of the weaners was very mixed, from plain quality and condition light weights through to well-bred light and medium weights presenting in forward condition. There was a good supply of heavy yearling restocker and feeder steers along with a few well-bred medium and heavy yearling heifers. The usual processors were in attendance, however there was reduced feeder competition.

Demand from restockers was very high for the weaner cattle regardless of quality. The light and medium weight steers were up to 50c/kg dearer. The better quality weaner heifers were firm, while there were substantial price gains for the plain quality light weights. There were cheaper trends for light weight yearling steers and heifers to restock with younger cattle representing a better option returning to the paddock. Heavy yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend of 5c to 15c/kg with a vast improvement in quality also. Medium and heavy yearling heifers to feed sold to a cheaper trend with odd sales remaining firm.

There was no market comparison for heavy grown steers. Plain condition cows were least affected in cheaper trends in the cow market. The well finished cows saw processor demand weaker, while the plainer condition cows saw restockers compete against the processors."
"The numbers doubled in a fortnight with 950 head penned. Yearlings were well supplied along with a few late vealers. There was a good supply of cows with grown steers and heifers in reasonable numbers. The condition of the offering was fair to very good. The majority of the grown cattle in prime condition. Quality varied greatly through the young cattle. The usual processors were in attendance along with a strong restocker presence. There was minimal feedlot activity.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with vealers to restockers selling to cheaper trends. Weight increases contributed. Lightweight yearling steers in store condition were keenly sought  with the better quality lines dearer. Some of the secondary quality steers struggled to maintain recent levels. Medium weights to restockers sold significantly cheaper with breed and quality contributing.Lightweight yearling heifers to restockers sold to a much dearer trend with a line of E U heifers attracting very strong support.. Once again secondary quality heifers attracted less demand. There was limited competition on the well finished heifers to the trade with the majority selling to cheaper trends.

Heavy grown steers to process sold to a cheaper trend with limited competition. The well finished grown heifers saw a firm to slightly cheaper trend. Demand from processors was weaker in the cow market with the market trend 5c to 8c/ kilogram cheaper and more on the lower yielding lots."
"The numbers doubled as producers take the opportunity to offload cattle as demand from restockers is strong and prices remain high. The bulk of the yarding were very lightweight vealers and yearlings in store condition. Overall the quality of the yarding was plain with a limited supply of quality cattle available. The condition of the penning was mostly plain. All regular buyers were in attendance.

The market trends were mostly driven by the quality of the cattle. Lightweight steer and heifer vealers to restock remained firm. The majority of these cattle were weaned. Light weight yearling steers to restock also sold firm with quality a variable in price change. Medium weight yearling steers to restock followed a similar trend with an odd sale slightly cheaper. Heifer yearlings to restock sold to a firm market, although the lightly muscled light weight heifers sold very well as buyers bought to a dollar value rather than quality. Trade heifer yearlings sold firm to dearer although the average quality was down.

Heavy steers sold firm. There was an increased offering of cows although quality and condition varied. The market showed improvement with heavy cows seeing a significant rise in both quality and price."
"The numbers doubled and the condition of the offering was plain with a small number of well finished lots through most categories. Most regular orders were in place with restocker activity high in light of a very encouraging start to the spring.

Condition counted for little through the young cattle offering with both restockers and processors competing on most lots. All grades sold to a dearer trend, through both steer and heifer categories. Restocker yearling steers sold 6c to 10c/kg higher. Heifer yearlings were well supplied with the majority sent off early to take advantage of a stronger market. Lightweight heifers to the trade and processors sold as much as 30c dearer with those to restockers 10c to 18c/kg dearer.

There were insufficient heavyweight steers and bullocks to quote, while the grown heifers were up to 9c/kg dearer. There were quite a few pregnant heifers offered that sold well although they did have and effect on the quality. The cow market followed the trend and sold 4c to 10c/kg dearer."
"The numbers continued to show a decline into the end of the financial year. Young cattle and cows once again dominated supply with the quality and condition showing quite a variation. All regular processors were in attendance along with the usual restocker and feedlot orders.

The market for vealer steers to restockers showed a firm to dearer trend through all weight classes with quality affecting some averages. Heifer vealers sold to a dearer trend to the processors and butchers, up to 5c/kg, while those to restockers sold cheaper. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold firm to cheaper for heavy weights, while the lighter cattle had some quality issues. Yearling heifers to the trade sold to a dearer trend on the medium weights. Heavy heifer yearlings remained firm.

Heavy steers sold 3c/kg dearer for the limited supply. The cow market realised a cheaper trend, down 2c to 3c/kg with little or no restocker demand on the plainer condition cows."
"The numbers continued to rise, due to the inclusion of quite a number of PTIC cows and heifers. The quality of the offering was greatly improved, although there were still quite a number of plainer conditioned yearlings suitable for restocking purposes. Most grades were represented with female cattle once again the dominant percentage. All regular buyers were in attendance along with an extra processor. There was a large gallery agents in attendance also.

Rain continued to play its part in the market. Restocker cattle sold to a dearer trend. Yearling steers were 8c to 10c/kg dearer and more in places. Heifer yearlings met strong competition from both restockers and processors at rates 6c to 15c/kg dearer. The processors were very strong on the light lean heifer yearlings as well as the well finished grades.

There were only a few heavy steers that sold dearer by 10c to 15c/kg. Grown heifers also sold to a dearer trend, up 10c to 15c and more in places. The cow market took off under a better quality offering of both medium and heavy grades. Prices rose by 10c to 12c, although taking into account the quality improvement the trend was 6c to 8c/kg better.

Cows and calves sold from $640 to $850/head. Some lightweight vealer cattle sold open auction with steers estimated at 165kg selling for $385 per head and heifers estimated at 140kg to 160kg making from $275 to $320/head."
"The numbers continued to reduce which is normal for mid winter on the Tablelands. The quality was a little disappointing compared to the previous week, with weaners and yearlings making up the bulk of the offering. There were a few older, heavyweight bullocks yarded, while the cows were in much smaller numbers than in past months.

The usual regular buyers atteneded and there was ba considerable increase in the numbers of local restocker buyers present. Trade steers were in lesser numbers and sold at firm rates, while the intensity of the restocker demand lifted values in a range between 10c and 20c/kg on steer weaners and yearling steers. The heifer portion of both weaners and yearlings struggled to reach the prices of the previous sale.

There were a few pens of medium to heavy bullocks, all of which sold at fully firm prices. Even the plainer types showed little price change from last sale. The cow market was very steady and prices remained fir. The bull demand fell away and prices were 5c/kg cheaper.

The top sale price recorded was the 220.2c/kg paid by restockers on two occasions for very light steer weaners."
"The numbers continued to fall away for the third week in a row. Normally numbers are increasing at this time and the falls may indicate that numbers are in shorter supply than previously anticipated, or that some growers are keeping weaners to value add next season.

The quality was well below previous sales, with similar comments about quality coming from other northern saleyards this week.

The cattle in the greatest numbers were weaners and heifer veal, with yearling numbers smaller, bullocks were in light supply and cows were at normal levels of supply.

The drop in numbers appears to have coincided with a slight market increase for most cattle. Weaner steers were fully firm, while heifer veal to slaughter and trade heifers sold at marginally better prices.

Restocker yearling steers, grown steers and bullocks sold to 1c or 2c dearer with the buyers showing a little more keeness.

Lighter cows met with stronger competition this week, with restocker demand appearing on the better framed but light weight cows. The better finished cows sold again to a solid and firm market."
"The numbers continued to drop, and so did the average quality of the offering.The bulk of the cattle were no better than fat score 3, with the recent wet and cold weather, having played havoc with the condition of young stock. The usual buyers were in attendance, and the market trend was firm, with just a few categories dearer.

Weaner steers were, on average, well below last sale quality, and together with the heifer veal, sold at firm rates.Yearling steers were fully firm, but the yearling heifers showed a little more condition than steers, and sold to 3c/kg dearer.

The few export weight steers and bullocks, sold at unchanged kilo rates, and the impression was, that the demand for an ideal weight bullock, continues to be strong.

For about the first time in years, there were no 4 score cows yarded, but the 2 and 3 scores sold at up to 3c/kg dearer."
"The numbers continued to decline as the sell off period winds down. The quality of the offering was fair to good with a few well finished cattle off crop available. There was a good selection of vealers and cows with all other categories represented. All regular buyers were in attendance for a market showing variable trends.

Steer vealers to restockers sold firm to 5c/kg dearer with the movement in the lightest and heaviest steers. Heifer vealers to the restockers sold to a cheaper trend, averaging 12c/kg. Heifer vealers to the trade also sold to a cheaper trend, down 12c/kg and more in places. A fair to good quality offering of yearling steers suitable to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend, down 8c to 11c/kg. Heifer yearlings to restockers sold cheaper, down 7c/kg. Heifer yearlings to the trade varied in quality and also price. The best sold slightly dearer while lower yielding heifers were cheaper.

There were no heavy steers at the previous sale to compare a market trend. The cow market realised a cheaper trend with the best 3 and 4 score cows to process down 1c to 2c/kg. Plain cows to process were cheaper by 5c while good restocker demand for plain cows saw suitable lots less affected, down 2c to 4c/kg."
"The numbers continued their upward trend with producers flooding the market in the face of seriously deteriorated conditions. Plain condition light weight young cattle were plentiful along with a few well finished heifers and cows. For the most part, the offering lacked sufficient condition and weight for processors. The usual buyers were in attendance.

Demand for the male portion of the light weight yearling cattle was very strong. Lightly muscled steers sold to dearer trends, while the heifer portion sold firm to slightly cheaper. Those categories saw price change affected by breed and quality. In some cases, the opportunity to purchase lines of cattle had a positive effect on average prices. The better quality yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold to dearer trends with strong gains. Yearling heifers to feed sold on a firm to slightly dearer market trend. The well finished heifers suitable to processors remained firm.

There were insufficient well finished heavy grown steers and heifers for a quote. Plainer quality and condition grown heifers to restockers and feeders saw a firm to cheaper trend. The good quality feeder heifers were as much as 9c/kg dearer. Plain condition cows attracted competition from both restockers and feedlotters with limited processor activity. The market trend was firm on the better cows and cheaper for the plainest lines. The well finished cows in limited supply saw a firm to slightly cheaper trend also with the quality not as good. Competition was very strong in the bull market resulting in a significantly dearer market trend."
"The numbers continue to decline which is not unusual for this time of year. The quality and condition of the offering showed quite considerable variation. There were a few well finished yearling heifers, only one pen of heavy steers and a few good cows. The majority of the yarding was showing the effects of the seasonal conditions.

The restocker yearling steer market was a little erratic, most sales showing a cheaper trend, with quality a factor. There was however, an odd sale that sold to a dearer trend as buyers targeted specific lots. The yearling heifers followed a similar trend. Restocker heifers were cheaper while some sales of trade heifers selling at firm to dearer rates.

There was only one pen of heavy steers offered making a true market quote difficult. The rate paid was up there with rates seen earlier in the week. The cow market showed a definite cheaper trend, medium weights 2c to 10c cheaper with the heavy cows 6c to 10c/kg cheaper. Bulls were firm to cheaper."
"The numbers continue to build in the face of a season becoming desperate for a lot of producers. Large numbers of cows penned as vendors start offloading breeders, some opting to sell cows and keep calves. Young cattle were once again in large numbers with increased supplies of vealers. There was a limited penning of heavy grown steers. The quality of the offering reflected the season with minimal well finished lots available. There was reduced processor competition, while there was extra feedlot activity. It was a variable market with most selling to a cheaper trend and some of the better quality and finished cattle firm to dearer.

The extra feedlot competition saw the better quality medium and heavyweight yearlings, both steers and heifers sold to a dearer trend, up to 10c/kg on steers, not quite as much for the heifers. Lightweights not suitable to the feeders and the secondary quality lines sold to a cheaper trend. There did not have to be a lot of difference in quality for there to be some quite large price reductions. Medium weight vealers to the trade saw substantial price falls with the trend up to 20c/kg cheaper.

The well finished heavy steers remained firm with an odd dearer sale for the improved quality lots. Grown heifers struggled under reduced competition with the plainer condition lots recording a big reduction in price. There were a small number of well finished heavy heifers firm to slightly cheaper. The cow market saw a much cheaper market trend with the 3 and 4 scores 7c to 15c/kg cheaper. Plain condition cows in large numbers experienced greater falls as processors struggled to absorb the volume being put forward. There was a large penning of bulls with demand weaker and trends cheaper."
"The numbers are slowly on the increase as we continue towards the traditional sell off period on the Tablelands. The quality and condition of the offering is starting to reflect the very good seasonal conditions with the penning showing an improvement. All grades were represented with increased numbers of vealers and grown steers. All regular buyers were in attendance along with some good restocker activity.

The young cattle market was strong through most grades. Vealer steers to restockers sold firm to 3c/kg dearer. The heifer vealers saw good competition from both restocker and processing orders, the trend firm for those to processors, and a little dearer to the restockers. There were some very good quality yearling steers offered with all going to either restockers or feedlots. Lightweight steers sold firm to 2c/kg dearer, while the medium and heavy steers followed a similar trend although there were some greater quality related price rises. Light trade yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 10c to 15c/kg as restockers pushed the processors on leaner cattle. Medium and heavy trade heifers also saw a strong market selling firm to 3c/kg dearer with feeder heifers following a similar trend.

There were good numbers of grown steers in the offering with restockers and feedlots active on those not quite finished. The heavy steers and bullocks sold at unchanged rates. Grown steers to restock and feeders saw rates remain firm. Grown heifers also increased in numbers with quality also improved, the market firm to dearer. The cow market was firm to slightly cheaper, although the top end of the cows was not quite up to last weekâ€™s quality."
"The numbers almost halved following only light rainfall but these numbers are the expectation for the rest of winter. Quality was very average and most cattle other than those off oats were very plain and wintery. Cows and heavy steers and bullocks were very short in number and the bulk of the yarding was young cattle.

Rain elsewhere had an extraordinary effect on the market prices with some outstanding increases obvious. Weaner and yearling restocker steers and trade heifers showed very big rises under very strong competition mainly from local restockers and wholesale traders. Some rises were as much as 20c/kg but the average was below that figure.

Heavy steers and bullocks and feeder steers were considerably dearer again under very keen competition. The cows in the yarding were only of average quality and yield but demand was strong and all prices rose from 7c to 12c/kg. The bull quality was plain but prices stayed firm.

The top price in the sale was 205.2c/kg paid by a restocker for steer weaners."
"The numbers almost doubled with an influx of cows. All categories were well represented in a mixed quality penning. There was a good supply of young cattle . The condition of the offering was fair to good with quite a lot of plainer condition cows alongside the well finished lines. The young cattle also showed a deal of variation. There were a few new faces in the buying gallery that also had some absentees.

Despite the increase in supply the young cattle market was strong under high demand. Weaner steers to restock in all weight categories sold to dearer trends with some quality related price change. There was little change in the heifer weaners to restock. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed sold on a firm to dearer trend with the strongest gains in the well finished heavy weights where quality was a factor. There was increased demand for yearling heifers with those to restock and feed selling to a dearer trend.

Grown steers with 2 or more teeth going to feed saw considerable price improvement with breed and quality contributing. The plainer condition and lightly muscled grown heifers to feed sold strongly on a cents per kilogram basis in comparison to the more forward heavier weight. The well finished heifers to process sold to a dearer trend. Strong competition for all classes of cows resulted in dearer trends throughout with some quality related price gains."
"The numbers almost doubled in what was a fairly plain conditioned offering. The quality of the yarding was only fair. The bulk of the offering was made up of yearlings, cows and heifers carrying permanent teeth. There were no heavy steers to speak of with most of the grown steers under 500kg. Not all regular buyers were in attendance although this did not seem to be a factor in market trends.

The better quality yearling cattle to restock and feed sold firm to 3c/kg dearer. The plainer quality cattle to restock sold to a slightly cheaper trend with this being the case for both steers and heifers. There were not a lot of yearlings suitable to the trade, those available sold firm.

There were no heavy steers to quote. The light and medium weight grown steers all went to restock and feed with no market comparison available from last week. Heifers carrying their permanent teeth sold to a cheaper trend with the quality also below last week. Most of them went to feed. Increased restocker activity underpinned the plain condition cow market, in fact creating a dearer market trend, up 7c to 9c/kg. The better conditioned cows to slaughter sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 10c/kg."
"The numbers almost doubled as the lead in to the normal Autumn sell off period begins in the Tablelands. All grades were represented in an offering of fair to good quality although yearling heifers were in limited numbers. The condition of the offering was also mixed with the majority of the young cattle of plain quality despite what has been a very good season until now. All regular buyers were in attendance and operating while restockers were reasonably active.

Light and medium weight fresh vealers sold mostly firm, both trade and restockers. There were almost double the number of yearling steers penned. All but a very odd steer went to feed or the paddock at rates firm to slightly dearer than last week. Breed quality saw medium weight restocker steers sell at cheaper rates with overall quality also affected by numbers, otherwise there was little change. Heifer yearlings suffered despite the low numbers to be 5c to 13c/kg cheaper and more in places, all grades affected.

Grown steers to slaughter condition sold to a dearer trend, up 3c/kg with feeders experiencing a similar trend. The grown heifers with 2 or more teeth sold to a cheaper trend, down 1c to 8c/kg.

The cow market held reasonably well with increased numbers offered. The better conditioned cows were 1c cheaper and up to 5c/kg cheaper plainer 2 scores to both restockers and trade. A good line up of bulls sold to a dearer trend with quality a factor."
"The numbers almost doubled as access to yards dries out. The quality of the offering was very mixed with some good lines of quality cattle to suit restockers and feeders along with plainer lots. The condition of the offering showed a great variation with some very well finished grown cattle to suit processors as well as a run of plain quality light conditioned manufacturing steers. The usual processors were in attendance as were the usual restocker and feedlot orders.

Light weight steers were keenly sought by restockers heading into what looks to be an outstanding season. Both the weaners and the yearlings sold to dearer trends. The few medium weights also attracted strong competition from restockers and feedlotters to sell to a dearer trend also. Heavy weight feeder steers sold to a cheaper trend with some breed related price change also. Light and medium weight yearling heifers sold to dearer trends with some well bred heifers in forward condition presented.

The manufacturing steers sold strongly in comparison to the well finished good quality lines. There is no like for like comparison available from the last sale. Feeder steers with 2 or more teeth attracted strong demand despite a large number in the light weight class. Well finished, good quality heavy grown steers saw processor competition very strong with a much dearer market trend the result. That strong processor demand carried into the grown heifers and cows with market trends also dearer. The bull market was firm to slightly dearer taking quality into account."
"The number of cattle yarded was well up on last weekâ€™s sale, boosted by several drafts of yearling steers and heifers. There was only a few vealers offered, while export cattle numbers increased. Quality of the young cattle was mainly plain, with yearling steers and heifers the largest percentage of the yarding.
 
Vealers sold to dearer trend as numbers declined and quality improved. The C2 vealer steers to restockers gained 14c with most sales around 187c/kg. Restocker heifers met strong demand selling from 109c to 132c, to settle at 123c/kg. Feeders and trade cattle struggled to hold firm with most sales around 187c, topping at 192c/kg.

"The number of cattle yarded was well down this week with a reduction in most categories.  Weaner cattle were once again well supplied and there was a fair penning of vealers.  Yearlings were in fair supply, while there was only an odd pen of grown steers and a smaller penning of cows.

Quality of the young cattle was mixed with mainly plainer type cattle offered.  There were some good runs of well-bred weaner steers that met very strong demand from restockers with sales up to 20c/kg dearer.  Vealer heifers to slaughter held firm, while most of the better-bred heifers went to restockers.  The largest percentage of yearling steers and heifers were acquired by either restockers or feeders at much stronger rates.  

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of cows with an odd pen of grown steers.  There was some well-finished milk tooth grown steers off crop that met keen demand toping at 201.8c/kg.  The penning of cows consisted mainly of 2 and 3 scores and saw little change; however restockers were active in the market keen to acquire store cows."
"The number of cattle yarded was well down consisting of a good supply of young cattle, while heifers and cows dominated the grown cattle. Quality of the young cattle was mixed with only a few vealers and an odd yearling going to the trade, with the largest percentage of yearling steers and heifers going to feeders and restockers.

The market varied as did quality, with vealer heifers to slaughter holding firm while restocker yearling steers sold to a dearer trend, to be 23c higher on 187c/kg. Restocker yearling heifers struggled to hold firm to be 9c lower on 161c/kg with limited restocker interest shown.

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of grown heifers and cows with only an odd pen of grown steers offered. Quality of the heifers and cows improved with a larger number of heavy cows penned. Most of the light grown steers went to feeders and a fair number of light heifers.

"The number of cattle yarded was up with increased numbers of weaner steers and vealer heifers penned, and there was a fair yarding of yearlings, consisting mainly of feeders and restocker cattle.  There were a few more bullocks and steers offered, while the yarding of cows was also up slightly.

Quality of the young cattle was mixed with some good runs of well bred cattle through the sale.  The largest percentage of weaner and yearling steers went to either feeders or restockers.  Competition was strong with restocker weaner steers and vealer heifers selling firm.  Feeder steers and heifers sold firm to a dearer trend for the better bred cattle dearer.

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows with several pens of grown steers and heavy bullocks, and a fair penning of heifers.  Bullocks and steers held firm with the younger type steers making the premium prices.  Heifers sold firm to slightly easier in places, while the cow market was stronger with heavy cows selling 10c dearer and light and medium weights gained 4c/kg."
"The number of cattle yarded was up with an increase in most categories. There were a fair number of vealers and some good runs of well bred yearling steers and heifers offered. The yarding of grown cattle consisted of a good supply of bullocks, steers and heifers with a good increase in cow numbers.

Quality of the young cattle was good with most of the vealer steers and yearling steers going to restockers and feeders. Competition was weaker for most grades with restocker steer vealers easing, while vealer heifers were 5c to 8c/kg cheaper. Restockers competed strongly on the better bred yearling steers with rates holding firm. Yearling heifers sold firm to slightly easier.

The yarding of export cattle was of good quality with several pens of well finished steers, bullocks and heifers. Bullocks and steers lost 10c/kg however, heifers held firm. The cow market also held firm to 3c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls met stronger demand."
"The number of cattle yarded was up slightly consisting of a good supply of yearlings and a small penning of vealers, while cows dominated the grown cattle.  Quality of the young cattle was mixed with a few pens of milk veal and several pens of well bred yearlings.

Competition was strong, although vealers struggled to hold firm.  The largest percentage of yearling steers went to feeders and restockers.

Trade yearling steers topped at 190c and heifers sold to 180c/kg. Feeder steers were slightly easier, although the well-bred steers were less affected, topping at 205.2c/kg, while the heifers sold according to quality.

This week bull numbers were doubled that of the number of cows yarded. There was very little processor interest in the small number of cows, while there was only one bull buyer active in the market this week, resulting in prices falling by 30c/kg, and more in places."
"The number of cattle yarded was down slightly, with vealers and yearlings making up a large percentage of the yarding. Grown cattle were in fair numbers.

"The number of cattle yarded increased, with young cattle and cows making up the largest percentage of the yarding. The young cattle consisted of a good supply of vealers and there was a much larger yarding of yearlings.

Competition was weaker with plain quality restocker vealer steers selling to a cheaper trend, however well-bred steers attracted keener competition toping at 195.2c/kg. Vealer heifers followed a similar trend toping at 170c/kg. Yearling feeder steers attracted a little more interest this week, especially for the better bred steers with medium weights improving by 2c, toping at 197.2c, to average around 177c/kg.

The small penning of export cattle was made up mainly of cows with only a few grown steers and heifers through the sale.  Competition was not as strong this week with the heavy cows attracting the best demand."
"The number of cattle yarded increased slightly, consisting of a few more weaner cattle, especially steers, while yearlings were well supplied and cows dominated the grown cattle. Quality of the young cattle was again generally plain in condition, with the exception of a few pens, however there was several runs of well-bred cattle that met keen demand from restockers and feeders.

Quality of the young cattle was mixed however, there was some good runs of well-bred weaners offered as well as feeders.  Competition was very strong for the weaner steers and heifers with restockers keen to acquire the large even lines of vendor bred cattle offered.  Feeder steers and heifers were keenly sought after to sell firm to slightly dearer.    

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of cows, with only an odd grown steer and a few pens of heifers.  Competition was strong with most sales firm to a dearer trend."
"The number of cattle yarded increased again this week with vealers, weaner cattle and yearlings making up the largest percentage of the yarding.  There were some good runs of yearlings suitable for feeders with only a few steers going to the trade and there was a good yarding of heifers.  Export cattle were in fair numbers with cows in the majority.

Quality of the young cattle was generally good with mainly well-bred cattle offered. Weaner steers were in fair numbers however, the deteriorating weather conditions saw prices reduced by 10c, while vealer heifers were down by 7c/kg. The largest percentage of yearling steers went to feeders and restockers with the light and medium steers up to 9c/kg cheaper, while the heavier domestic feeder steers saw little change.

"The number of cattle increased with feeder steers and light yearling heifers making up a fair percentage of the yarding.  There were a few more grown steers however, trade cattle were in very limited supply and the calf numbers were also down, while there was a fair yarding of cows.

The market trend improved with competition much stronger for the restocker and feeder steers with increased numbers of suitable cattle available.  The good supply of light yearling heifers met stronger demand from the trade as well as restockers and feeders.  Most of the calves in the market were sold by open auction.

The yarding of export cattle consisted of several pens of well finished steers with a limited number of heifers, while the yarding of cows consisted of an odd pen of high yielding lines, although most were plainer grades.  The market improved for all classes of cows with the lighter grades making the best gains.

The top price of the sale was for a pen of grown steers at 157.4c/kg."
"The majority of the yarding was very well bred cattle, mainly weaners, vealers and cows with a limited number of bullocks and almost no trade cattle. Weaner numbers were dominated by steers while there was a little more condition on the heifer portion. There were limited numbers of feeder steers and heifers and the steer portion contained some pens of quality cattle, but the heifer portion was plain.

There was plenty of competition available for the weaners and vealers, and the steer portion to restockers sold at 3c to 4c/kg dearer. The heifer portion going to slaughter were, however, cheaper by a similar margin. There were limited numbers of feeder heifers yarded but their quality was plain and the price was 5c/kg cheaper.

Demand was steady for light bullocks and the few manufacturing cattle and the market price was unaltered. Export heifers sold at firm rates while the bulk of the cow offering also remained firm. The few lots of heavier feeder steers met a keen enquiry and sold at firm prices while the bull market was steady."
"The low numbers offered reflect some optimism by producers in the current seasonal conditions being experienced throughout the district. This is giving producers the option to hold stock if they donâ€™t like the prices being offered. There were limited numbers penned in most grades. There were no bullocks or vealers and very few trade cattle penned with yearlings making up the biggest percentage of the offering. 

The market trend for the young cattle was firm to dearer. There was surprisingly limited restocker demand given the improved pasture conditions. 

Export heifers were up to 15c/kg dearer with the improved quality accounting for most of that rise. There were insufficient numbers of export cattle for a reliable quote.

There were 35 cow and calf units sent from the central west and they sold from $630 to $745/head."
"The light falls of rain in the past 24 hours had little affect on the yarding size. Quality was similar to the previous sale with weaners and cows again dominating the offering. Feeder steers and heifers were well supplied while there were a few more pens of bullocks yarded. Weaner steers, most of which are now weaned were good quality well bred cattle while there was a great variety in the quality and condition of the cows available. There were very few cattle other than yearling heifers which were bought by the trade. 

The usual regular orders were represented in young cattle but the lack of trade cattle provided problems for some buyers who were looking to obtain some better trade stock. There were big numbers of heifer vealers yarded and the market was dearer for both slaughter heifers and restocker heifers. Steer weaner prices were very solid and values were unchanged. Feeder heifer yearling sold at steady rates under good competition.

Export feeder steers were in greater demand and values improved by an average of 4c/kg. Cow prices were little altered from the previous sale while there was a slight increase in interest in the greater number of PTIC cows yarded. Heavy heifers sold at firm rates while the lower quality bulls sold at slightly easier prices."
"The lead in to the end of financial year saw numbers reduced as producers look to carry stock over. The quality of the offering was very mixed with plain quality light weight cattle well represented. There was also a fair supply of well finished grown heifers and cows. Most of the regular processors were in attendance and there was increased restocker competition.

Strong competition from restockers for the plain quality, light weight young cattle, resulted in dearer trends for both steers and heifers in the weaner and yearling categories. The attraction for these cattle was the minimal outlay. Increased competition saw the medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restockers and feeders sell to a dearer trend with breed and quality accounting for a large price range. The better quality yearling heifers also attracted keen demand from both restockers and feedlotters, selling to a dearer trend also.

Very few well finished heavy grown steers were available to processors. The grown heifers suitable to processors sold to a dearer trend, up to 15c/kg. Reduced restocker competition on the plainer condition cows resulted in a cheaper trend for 2 scores. Weaker demand and a drop in quality affected prices for well finished cows in a cheaper market trend. Heavy bulls remained firm."
"The last sale of the year yielded yet another small yarding which is possibly a sign of things to come in the new year. There were only a few lots of slaughter cattle, most of which were cows. The bulk of the yarding were restocker type yearlings, some of which were good breed quality while the balance were plain bred and in light store condition. There were no heavy steers or bullocks and no trade cattle available to quote.

Due to the small yarding and the restricted number of days available to slaughter the market was cheaper for all descriptions. Restocker buyers were in very much restricted numbers and with the exception of just a few pens of best quality yearlings the market was considerably cheaper averaging 6c to 12c/kg down.

The same comment applied to the cow market with two regular buyers already closed for the break and the market for all descriptions was cheaper by up to 10c/kg. The same price loss was repeated on all the older cattle yarded. Included in the run was a pen of 17 fresh young cows with 3 to 4 month old calves at foot, which were bought by a restocker at $555/head. 

The top sale price was 160c/kg paid to a pen of light weight steer yearlings bought by a restocker."
"The last sale of the year saw quality remain very mixed with yearlings and cows making up the bulk offered along with a larger than usual penning of bulls. There was reduced processor competition. 

A variable young cattle market that saw a better quality pen of heifer vealers sell slightly dearer. Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold to a mostly firm trend with quality related price variations. The quality of the medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed was the main factor behind the cheaper prices. Heifer yearlings sold to a dearer trend with prices up 2c to 6c/kg, the fresh lightweights to the trade were most affected.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote with those penned lacking quality. Prices for grown heifers varied with the best quality C muscles selling firm to dearer, while some of the secondary lots were cheaper. The cow market was somewhat erratic at times before settling and showing a slightly dearer trend with price averages up 3c to 4c/kg. The bull market struggled and saw a much cheaper trend."
"The last sale for the year saw numbers reduced, with feeder steers and heifers making up the largest percentage of the yarding, along with a few pens of weaner steers.  There were no vealer heifers or grown steers to quote however, there was a few pens of grown heifers through the sale, while cows were in limited supply.

Quality of the yarding was made up mainly of plainer grades although there were several lines of well-bred young cattle offered. Feeder buyers and restockers competed strongly on the weaner and feeder steers and heifers.  Weaner steers and domestic feeder steers held firm, while feeder heifers were 3c to 5c/kg cheaper and the light trade heifers saw little change.

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of cows with insufficient steers for a reliable quote and there were a few pens of grown heifers.  Heifers were 5c cheaper while 3 score cows lost 5 cents and 2 score cows were 10c/kg cheaper, the bull market held firm."
"The larger number of cattle yarded was up, regaining last weeks downturn. Yearling steers and heifers were in the greatest numbers, while there was a fair yarding of cows and only an odd pen of grown steers and heifers.

Quality was mixed with some well-finished cattle off crop, although there were quite a number of plain cattle. The largest percentage of yearling steers were acquired by restockers and feeders that met strong competition, although struggled to reach last weeks rates. Yearling heifers were in good supply with several pens of C3 heifers being crop finished however, the majority was comprised of light plain heifers. There was an odd sale of heifers that held firm although most were slightly cheaper.

The export section consisted of a few pens of steers and heifers and a fair supply of cows. Quality was mixed although there were some heavy high yielding cows offered. Steers and heifers sold firm, while cows met a very strong market and bulls sold to a dearer trend.

Restockers paid the top price of 219.2c/kg for a pen of yearling steers estimated to weigh 280kg lwt."
"The lack of rain caused a heavy increase in numbers, the biggest yarding since May 1997. The bulk of the yarding were unfinished, but the average quality, both in breed and condition, was slightly improved. Weaners, heifers and cows were in the majority, and there was an increased number of yearling off steers.

There was a cheaper market trend in all types, with heifers and heifer weaners the most affected. Restock Buyers kept the better quality yearling steers at respectable level, but demand for all heifers was weak.

Heavy steers were short supplied and plain in type, and sold to a 3c/kg cheaper market.

Cows, in heavy supply, sold to 5c/kg per kilogram less, across all weights, but the heavier bulls sold at a slightly better rate, against the trend."
"The increasing number of dry patches in the area are responsible for the heavy increase in yarding size. The average quality of the offering was well below the standard of the last sale with trade heifers being the exception to that rule. All the regular buyers attended the sale.

The trade and plain trade cattle sold to another firm market for all weights, with an odd lot of the better heifer yearlings showing slight price improvement.

There was no change in the price paid for restocker yearling steers.

The export market showed a hesitation not seen since the holiday break, with bullocks selling to a weaker trend of 2 c/kg and some plainer grown steers selling up to 5 c/kg cheaper. 

The very few high yield heavy cows sold at a firm price, but the majority of cows averaged a price fall of 6c/kg with light cows selling up to 10c/kg cheaper."
"The increased yarding contained more of the better finished cattle than earlier, but the average quality was only fair to plain. There were many more medium to heavy heifers yarded that were two tooth and older together with reasonable pens of cows and some big lines of yearlings mainly suitable for restockers. Export and domestic feeders were in good supply but there were very few trade cattle, bullocks or vealers.

The usual buyers were in attendance including a fair representation of local growers looking for restocking young cattle. The steer portion of the yearling steers sold at fully firm rates to restockers while most of the lightweight young heifers also went to restockers at slightly dearer prices. Feeder heifers sold strongly at firm rates.

Export cattle met a much less enthusiastic enquiry and the very few bullocks and heavy steers yarded were cheaper by up to 6c/kg. Export heifers and all the medium to heavy cows were cheaper by an average between 5c and 7c/kg while bulls were all cheaper by up to 15c/kg. Export feeder steers sold steadily at firm prices."
"The increased numbers were probably the result of better recent prices coupled with the continued dry weather. The feed situation has not improved even though there have been some scattered rain across the area. The quality of the yarding was much better with some good lines of heavier restocker steers, a similar number in yearling steers, and a very much increased number of light calves. Cows were fair to good quality and yield, but there were no bullocks and only a few tradeweight cattle.

There was some variety in the market trands with restocker steer yearlings and the yearling heifers selling at firm rates. The light calves though sold at dearer rates of up to 20c/kg. Restocker demand was steady particularly for lighter weighted cattle.

Some of the heavyweight restocker steers struggled a little for price due to the limited restocker competition. Many of these steers were too heavy for the average restocker enquiry. Light cows sold at firm rates while a few pens of better yielding cows were dearer by up to 5c/kg. Only a few bulls were available and they sold at firm values."
"The increased numbers were mostly in the cow section while the steers and bullocks were also better supplied. Quality was mixed with fair numbers of the young cattle showing the effects of winter. Trade weight cattle to slaughter were scarce with most of the young steers going to restocking and feeder orders.

The usual buyers supported the sale with restockers showing plenty of strength with cattle to these orders holding the rises of the previous sale. Plain heifer vealers increased in value meeting strong competition.  The best presented of the steer and heifer yearlings sold at near firm rates while the plainer end of the heifer portion eased in value.

Steers and bullocks sold at least fully firm while all cows regardless of condition lifted 2c to 4c/kg.

The top price of the day was 207c/kg paid for a pen of light steer weaners."
"The increased numbers were caused by the fast approaching Christmas break, when Armidale sales are suspended for two weeks.The average quality improved, with most categories being well represented.  A feature of the sale were four pens of excellent, high yielding cows, some pens of well finished light bullocks, and a number of ideal trade heifers. One major buyer of light cattle did not attend the sale, otherwise competition was the same as last sale.

There was a weakening in the trade cattle market, with prices lower by 2c to  3c/kg. The only alteration in the price of restock steers was caused by a change in the quality and the demand for store steers was again strong.

Heavy steers and light bullocks were well finished, but their market eased by 2c/kg. Most of the cows sold to a cheaper trend of  2c to 3c/kg, but the few pens of those top cows, sold to almost firm rates.

The bull market was 4c cheaper, but the quality was below last sale."
"The increased numbers in the market were not unusual at this time in the season as growers lighten numbers in anticipation of winter feed shortages. There were some very well bred cattle yarded which included over 1,000 weaner cattle. Yearlings were again well supplied but most were unfinished. Bullocks and heavy steers were short supplied but feeder cattle and cows made up a fair percentage of the yarding. All the regular buyers attended the sale but the market trend was mostly cheaper even though there were a few descriptions which held value. 

Restocker weaners and heavy trade vealers sold at remarkably firm rates but secondary types and most young female cattle sold from 8c to 16c/kg cheaper. Restockers were keen to buy cattle but only at reduced rates and the strength of the weaner steer market made buying difficult for many growers. Trade steers were cheaper by 8c/kg, but they were only in small lots.

The very few bullocks yarded were considerably cheaper mainly for the older ones. Heavy heifers and all cows averaged 10c/kg cheaper with some heavy pens selling up to 15c/kg easier. A similar price loss was evident in the bull market. Export and domestic feeder steers also lost value on an average of 8c/kg."
"The increased numbers consisted of mostly plain condition cattle, with the quality only fair. Yearlings and cows made up the bulk of the offering with very few heavyweight steers and grown heifers on any substance. The regular buyers were in attendance although export operators were fairly subdued.

The plain condition of the young cattle was highlighted by the fact that only 10% went to slaughter with the balance going back to the paddock. The improved seasonal conditions saw restockers very active again, particularly on the lightweight yearlings. Steers sold quite a bit dearer, especially on the plain quality lightweight grades with restockers paying little attention to muscle development. The market for the heifer yearlings back to the paddock also saw a dearer trend while the small number of plain quality heifers to the trade sold to a cheaper trend.

There were very few good quality heavy steers offered with those penned selling to a cheaper trend, down 4c/kg.The penning of grown heifers were of mixed quality, mostly on the plainer side. The few good heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 5c with the plain grades selling to a cheaper trend, down 8c to 10c/kg. 

The larger cow offering included quite a few plain condition lots that attracted good restocker competition, they sold firm to 4c dearer. Cows to slaughter met much weaker demand to sell 5c to 10c/kg cheaper."
"The increased numbers available were mainly light-weight yearling cattle suitable for restocking. The average quality was similar to the previous sale with just a few pens of bullocks and older steers, together with a fair yarding of medium weight cows. Restocker cattle made up by far the greatest percentage of the yarding. There was no trade-weight cattle offered.

The usual buying field attended but there was less intensity shown by buyers and the market therefore was firm to cheaper. Feeder and restocker yearling steers sold at firm rates but the heifer equivalent was cheaper by up to 6c/kg. There were no vealers yarded.

Export cattle sold to a cheaper trend and in some cases the price falls were almost extreme. Bullocks sold at cheaper rates averaging 4c/kg less. Medium and light cows were the only descriptions available and they sold in a range of 10c to 15c/kg cheaper. Lighter weight cows were slightly less cheap while bull prices were 15c to 20c/kg easier."
"The increase in supply was most likely to have been caused by the sudden increase in prices, and the equally sudden falling away in numbers across the state following the good rains. The greatest bulk of the offering came off oat crops which are reaching the end of their growing season. It was one of the better August yardings with most cattle except vealers, well represented. Yearlings were well supplied, but they were mainly light restocker cattle, while cow and bullock numbers were similar to last sale.

There were some extraordinary price rises recorded with restocker cattle demand much keener than last sale. Prices were up to 20c/kg dearer for those types while the trade cattle showed smaller increases. The demand for all feeder and backgrounding yearlings, also reached a very high level with prices considerably stronger. 

There were some very good bullocks yarded and they sold under strong demand at unchanged prices. The enquiry for cows strengthened considerably with the greatest demand being seen on the heavier, well fattened cows which recorded rises up to 15c/kg. The average price rise however, was closer to 12c/kg. The yarding of bulls was much better yielding and coupled with a greater demand, prices were to 25c/kg and more, dearer.

The top sale price recorded was 219.6c/kg paid by a local restocker, for light C2 yearling steers estimated to weigh 255kg."
"The increase in numbers is normal for this time of year when the vealers and weaners are yarded seasonally. Agents anticipate that the bigger yardings will continue until late in June.

In the best breed quality yarding of the season the yarding included close to 2,000 vealers, weaners and yearling cattle.

Cows and heavy steers and bullocks were in small numbers, again a normal situation in the autumn in New England. There were similar numbers of buyers of slaughter cattle in attendance while there were numbers of  orders available for feeder steers , steer weaners and yearling steers, the demand for all these types coming from feedlots or restockers.

The market for all the male cattle in the offering was fully firm with almost all male cattle except the bulls being bought to restock or feed on.  The female cattle including heifer veal, yearling heifers and cows were all cheaper with heifer vealers losing 2c to 3c/kg. Trade and plain yearling heifers were cheaper in the range of 3 to 7 c/kg with the demand weakening as the sale progressed.

The cows were not top quality but none the less they sold to a lesser demand by losing between 3 and 6 c/kg from last sales strong showing."
"The increase in numbers is a normal happening at this time of the year with the prospect of winter not far away. The season has deteriorated quickly and growers are keen to unload . The quality of the yarding was fair and similar to that of last week with light vealers and weaners yarded in increasing numbers and good trade cattle were in short supply. The older steers, 400kg to 550kg, were in big numbers as the opportunity to finish them properly has passed. There were a lot of cows yarded and a fair percentage of them were lightweight 2 scores.

The trend in the market varied between firm and cheaper for most descriptions. The light vealers sold between firm and a few cents dearer but grower competition on the steers was restricted to the best breed quality.Heifers were cheaper but the quality was generally plain. Feeder steers sold well again without a sign of price change but some of the older steers not well enough finished sold at cheaper rates. 

The  best bullocks  and heavy steers were fully firm but some of the light cows varied within the market between firm and 4c/kg cheaper. All the medium and heavy cows sold well but with just a hint of a little less interest from some buyers. The heavy heifers to export were also marginally easier. There was little quality in the bulls but no price change."
"The ideal rain decimated numbers for an offering of only 410 cattle,  with some reasonable quality slaughter cattle available, and just a few restock steers. A "" wet weather "" market resulted,  and all classes of stock showed healthy rises,  in some cases almost extreme gains.

Yearlings to the trade or to restock, met very strong demand, resulting in a high percentage price increases in the vicinity of  7 to 8%.

Export cattle displayed the greatest increase,  with the heavier cows in some sales,    rising by 12%,  and export weight heifers showing increased values up to 15 %. With such a small yarding no feeder cattle were available."
"The high prices drew out a bigger yarding and that is unusual for so late in the winter on the Northern Tablelands. Quality did not reach the heights of last sale with less finished cattle and a big increase in the numbers of plain and light weaners and yearling cattle. The biggest numbers in the market were weaners and yearlings with cows in fair numbers as were the heavy steers and bullocks.

There was good demand for all young cattle in particular with restockers very keen buyers and trade demand was at the usual high level. Vealers and restocker steer yearlings and weaners were slightly dearer while the very best trade heifers in all weights were marginally dearer under keen competition. There were only a few singles yarded in the trade steers as most were bought by restockers.

After weeks of continuously escalating export cattle prices the market for these cattle steadied but still remained at a very solid and fully firm rate. There were a few pens of the best yielding bullocks that showed a slightly dearer tendency but they were the exception and not the rule. Cows sold strongly and there were a few pens of quality cows offered. The bull market stayed solid and firm.

The top price was 240c/kg paid by restockers for lightweight steer weaners."
"The heavy yardings continue as winter approaches, but this weeks quality was plain, and very few fat cattle were available. 40% or more were weaners and light veal, most of plain quality and lighter weights, and the balance were cows and yearlings. There were very few steers or bullocks yarded, and their quality was only fair.

Restocker enquiry covered all the steer weaners, the best quality were firm, but the plain types were 3c/kg cheaper. Heifer veal sold well, to average 3c dearer, some lots were up to 6c and 7c dearer. The best trade yearlings sold to a dearer market, while plain types stayed firm to dearer for steers to restock.

Bullocks and heavy steers were not quite finished and therefore stayed at the same rates.

Cows met the usual strong demand to record the same values as last sale, with few high yield cows available."
"The heavy rains in the area kept numbers well down. Apart from pens of cows and a few pens of trade cattle, the average quality was fair only but similar to recent sales. Weaner cattle and lightweight yearlings were in the greatest numbers but there were no heavy steers or bullocks yarded. Export and older heifers were also in fair numbers.

Demand for all cattle was very strong with young cattle leading the way with a very keen enquiry. A few pens of well finished trade yearlings sold at dearer rates, while particularly keen restocker demand forced a rise in prices. There were no well finished trade steers yarded. Light vealers to slaughter also sold at dearer prices in keeping with other northern markets this week.

There were no bullocks to quote but heavy and older export heifers sold at dearer prices. The demand for cows was much stronger and values across most descriptions were dearer by 5c/kg. There were very few feeder steers available, and certainly not enough to quote a market.

The top sale price was the 245c/kk paid by a restocker for a pen of light steer weaners."
"The heavy rain of the past few days had little affect on yarding size but the high prices kept a steady number coming forward. There was not the quality in the bullocks this week but most other cattle showed an improvement in quality. Yearlings and feeder steers once again were the bulk of the yarding but there were some good numbers of cows available also. The very light splitter calves were not in as great a number as in previous weeks.

Very few northern sales operated in the north late in this week due to rain. The result was a very much dearer market in almost all descriptions of young cattle with yearlings heifers and light feeder steers improving very considerably under strong and sustained competition. The restocker steer yearling market is at a very high level but it stayed at  firm. Trade cattle were in very light numbers but showed a slight improvement.

The highlight of the market was the performance of the export cattle market with extreme price rises in all categories. Bullocks were plainer quality but sold at dearer rates. Heavy export heifers were in fair numbers and the demand for them and the better cows were quite outstanding with record prices being achieved on a number of occasions. An outstanding pen of two tooth heifers sold for 160.4c/kg to easily break an existing record. There were a number of pens of cows that sold in excess of 150c/kg and to a top of 167.6c/kg and that easily outstripped the previous highest figure. Export feeder steers up to 530kg met a much stronger market and also sold at record levels."
"The heavily reduced yarding is a surprise considering that this is normally the biggest selling period. Quality was much improved in the smaller yarding with yearlings and cows still making up the bulk of the yarding but most categories were fairly represented.  There were a number of bullocks available but they were not of the best yield. The numbers of light vealers fell back but most of the offering was good quality. The bulls in the yarding were well above last sale for yield. Feeder steers were not in great numbers but there were good numbers of quality yearling restocker steers yarded.

The usual buyers were in attendance. The general trend in the young cattle market was cheaper with the exception of the light vealers that gained some ground. Trade cattle sold at cheaper rates as did the restocker yearlings. Demand for yearling steers to restock was fairly steady but at a new and lower set of values.

There was a considerable drop in the price of heavy steers and bullocks and the continued weekly fall in price is starting to cause some concern amongst growers. Cows sold fairly steadily but at the end of the day a cheaper trend was the result. The bull market was a little stronger but for a better quality product.  Feeder steers cheapened in line with the fall in price of the slaughter steers."
"The greater numbers brought with it an improvement in quality. There were a few pens of better conditioned trade heifers yarded together with some well bred steer yearlings suitable for restocking, and numbers pf plain conditioned heifer weaners. Heavy steers and bullocks were limited to just a few pens while there were increased numbers of cows available.

The regular buyers attended and the market trend was firm or dearer on all young stock. A number of pens of quality trade weight heifers sold to a dearer trend and a portion of that price rise was caused by the better yields available. Restocker young cattle met the usual very keen demand with prices firm to slightly dearer.

There were just enough bullocks and steers available to recognise a firm market trend, while a number of pens of older manufacturing bullocks sold at a steady set of values. Cows were slightly dearer while demand for bulls increased and values rose by an average of 6c/kg.

Highest sale price was 224.2c/kg paid by a restocker for very lightweight steer weaners."
"The good rain in the district had the affect of severely restricting the numbers yarded and therefore the prices for most categories were increased. Over half the yarding were well finished slaughter cattle while the balance were either store cattle or light and unfinished. Cows were again in the biggest numbers while there were fewer yearlings available by percentage of the yarding. There were enough steers to quote and feeder steers and export heifers were in fair numbers.

There were very few cattle yarded that did not sell at dearer rates with the bigger price rises in young cattle being in restocker steers and in trade heifers. Splitter vealers were dearer also but they were better yielding calves this week. Restocker demand was predictably dearer and the prices rose accordingly.

There was an increase in the price of the few bullocks offered, as there was in all export oriented cattle. Heavy heifers were in strong demand having picked up some of the price lost over the last few weeks. The demand for all cows showed remarkable increases, as all buyers of export cattle were keen to gain a market share. Light cows sold well but the big rises were reserved for the better and heavier cows where price rises up to 20c/kg were recorded. There were only a few bulls yarded and their price did not change.

The top sale price was 240c/kg paid by a restocker for light steer weaners."
"The fist sale since early December saw a total of 700 head yarded. There was a good supply of heavyweight grown cattle including cows and bulls while yearlings were well supplied. There were a few early vealers penned. Overall the quality and condition of the offering was fair to good. There were a few new and returning orders in place alongside the regular buyers.

The only local market comparison available is from over a month ago. Restocker competition on the early vealers was very strong, whilst cheaper than the last sale they compared favourably to New year levels. The yearlings to restock and feed sold to cheaper trends than the last sale and considerably so. Once again however the market compared well to others.

There were some very good quality well finished heavy grown steers penned. They attracted limited processor competition. The well finished grown heifers attracted a little more processor competition with the best showing little change since the last sale. There was strong restocker competition on the plainer conditioned lightweights. Extra competition on cows saw the market hold up reasonably well to show only a slightly cheaper trend. A large penning of heavy bulls attracted limited competition despite there being several processors operating."
"The first sale of the year saw a very small offering of mixed quality cattle. Very good rain and a wait and see attitude the most likely reason for the fall in numbers. Young cattle dominated with limited supplies of grown cattle. There were some good quality light vealers penned with heifer yearlings in fair numbers. Not all regular buyers were in attendance and this made a little difference in the market.

Vealers to both restockers and the trade saw little change in the market from the pre Christmas levels. The small offering of yearling steers were plain in quality and sold at firm to slightly dearer rates. The very best heifer yearlings to the trade sold dearer while those heifers not quite finished and lacking a bit of yield saw little change, both to the trade and to restockers.

There were very few grown cattle showing any quality offered, with insufficient numbers to quote a market trend."
"The first sale of the new financial year saw numbers rebound from the previous sale. There was a good mix of cattle through all categories with some well bred and well finished lots along side a fair percentage showing the effects of the colder weather. There was an increased processor presence with the increased supply seeing the return of some. The usual restocker and feedlot orders were in place. 

Demand was strong through the young cattle with restockers active on the lighter weights. Both steer and heifer weaners sold to dearer trends under stronger demand while quality also improved. The limited supply of medium and heavy weight yearling steers also sold to dearer trends with some quality related price improvement. Good quality medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to restock and feed posted strong gains.

There were insufficient well finished heavy grown steers to quote. The increased competition resulted in well finished grown heifers selling to dearer trends. Those with 2 or more teeth to feed also saw a dearer trend. The greatest improvement on the day was in the cow market where increased competition combined with the strong  recent demand saw the well finished heavy weight cows show improvements of 60c to 70c/kg on the sale of a fortnight ago. Heavy bulls also sold to a dearer trend."
"The first sale in autumn brought with it a considerable increase in numbers with the first of the bigger lots of new season weaners making an apprearance. Quality was fair with most of the cattle carrying two or three score fat cover. There were very few export cattle yarded and that trend may well last well into the winter months. The bigger yardings of weaners are expected to last until at least the end of June.

The usual regular orders for young stock were represented and there were a few more restocker orders in evidence. Most pens of lightweight yearling heifers sold at slightly dearer prices due to the strong demand received from feedlot buyers. Trade yearlings and vealers, lightweigtht feeder steers and all restocker cattle sold to a very steady and therefore unaltered market trend. The lack of splitter calves and lightweight vealers is probably a reflection of the good season, with many being held back to value add.

Bullocks and heavy steers were slightly cheaper while most cows sold at easier rates due to a drop in quality. The bull yarding was plainer quality but values were dearer by up to 4c/kg. The export heifer prices remained unchanged."
"The first sale for a month yielded 304 mixed cattle. The market consisted of a mixed quality offering of yearling and some late weaners, along with a good penning of cows and a large increase in bull numbers. Only two exporters operated with mixed competition from restockers and feeder operators.

Weaner steer demand was high on several pens of late weaners to see that category sell to significantly dearer trends. There was a plainer offering of the heifer portion with these also experiencing a dearer trend throughout. Trends improved considerably through the yearling steer penning with strong demand from restockers and opportunistic competition. Feeder operators showed strong demand for pens of medium weight yearling heifers to see firm to dearer trends for the most part. Yearling heifers to processors were also dearer.

Quality lifted in the grown steer offering to see stronger trends with the grown heifer market firm. Cows improved considerably through all grades with medium weights up to 50c/kg better. The well finished heavy weights sold to significantly dearer trends. Increase bull numbers saw trends also improve for heavy and lighter weight bulls.

Market Reporter, Stephen Adams."
"The final sale for this financial year saw numbers reduce to 745 head. Young cattle were well supplied along with some very good cows, grown steers and grown heifers. The quality and condition of the offering was fair to good. The usual buyers were in attendance.

There were varying trends through the young cattle where restocker weaners sold to cheaper trends with breed and quality accounting for significant price reductions. Light weight yearling steers to restockers experienced little change with the heavy feeder steers following a similar trend. Yearling heifers to restock and feed saw a firm to slightly dearer trend for a very mixed quality offering.

Heavy grown steers to process sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend however did not carry the weight or finish of the previous sale. The good quality well finished grown heifers to processors followed a similar trend. There was not as much restocker competition in the cow market however this had little effect with market trends remaining firm across all classes. There was some quality related price change. 

Market reporter James Armitage"
"The final sale for the financial year saw a small increase in numbers. Young cattle were well supplied and there were a few heavy steers, while cows made up the bulk of the export offering. Quality was very mixed, carrying through all grades. All regular processors were in attendance and restocker activity was high.

Demand for steer vealers from restockers was high with very lightweights up to 30c/kg dearer. The medium weights also sold to a dearer trend, up to 5c, while a better quality offering of heavier steer vealers remained firm. Heifer vealers to the trade sold to a dearer trend, up 2c to 3c, with those to restockers remaining firm. Quality was an issue with cheaper prices for lightweight yearling steers. The medium and heavyweights to restock and feed attracted keen demand to record significant price gains. There was also a quality component to the price improvement. Heifer yearlings to the trade sold firm to slightly dearer.

Quality contributed to price change for heavy grown steers in a dearer market. The cow market saw heavy, high yielding cows sell to a dearer trend, with prices improving by as much as 12c/kg. The balance of the cows were firm to 2c dearer. Restockers competed strongly for PTIC cows."
"The fierce winds of recent days were responsible for the big increase in numbers as the feed situation has dramatically worsened in a very short period. It was one of the lightest conditioned yardings seen for many years with cows and their calves each selling separately and dominating the yarding. Weaners were also well supplied and most were in very light condition. There were very few fat cattle of any description available.

The usual regular buyers attended the sale and most descriptions were cheaper. Light calves sold at cheaper rates and the bulk were bought by restockers rather than abattoirs. Trade cattle were only in small lots and sold at cheaper prices while the few feeder steers were cheaper under a much quieter demand. Restocker yearling cattle varied widely in price but most sold to an easier trend.

With the exception of a pen or two the cows sold between 7c and 10c/kg cheaper with demand dropping away very quickly on some of the very light cows. There were no bullocks or heavy steers of quality to quote and export heifers sold to a cheaper trend as did the bulls which were lightly muscled generally.

The top sale price was 136c/kg paid for two older steers that were fat score three."
"The few more numbers provided an improved quality yarding with cows well represented as were lightweight heifer yearlings. Bullocks and steers were only in small lots and restocker steers were in strong demand but supply was very light indeed. Feeder steers were also short supplied.

In the young cattle the improved quality was responsible for a few cents rise, but generally the market was very stable in all descriptions. Trade heifers were sought after but the supply was low and apart from cows the yarding was mainly restocker type cattle.

The same situation was seen in the few steers and bullocks in the yard with the market showing very little change. There were some very good cows in the yarding and the demand for them was quite strong and consistent and that was brought about by the better yields available. In keeping with other sales for the week the market appears to have consolidated at the lower rates.

The top sale price was 238c/kg paid for light vealers under 200kg."
"The feature of the sale was the sudden improvement in the overall quality.  The yarding consisted of 200 quality light bullocks and the big increase in the numbers of pens of quality restocker yearling steers on offer. Weaner cattle were not in big numbers but were of a much improved standard of quality.

The regular buyers attended the sale and the bidding throughout was very keen.

Restocker weaners and yearling steers sold particularly well under the strongest demand for the season. The very light steers weaners sold to a very much improved price while the steers weaners over 200kgs also sold well with buyers appreciating the better quality of the yarding.

Trade heifers were mostly lightweights and they sold to a fully firm market.

There was keen competition for the bullocks with the prices attained being very solid and consistent.  The same comment could be made in the cow market with numbers falling away but the quality of the smaller numbers is being maintained.

There were only a few bulls yarded but they sold strongly at firm rates."
"The fat quality in the yarding was better, with most types represented, but, cows were the dominant numbers, and there were only a few bullocks offering.

The trend in the market, and almost across the board, was cheaper with heifers,  both light and heavy,  losing 8% to 12% of their value. A few pens of well finished yearling steers were cheaper, but not to the same degree as the heifers.

Heavy steers and bullocks displayed small losses,  but the cow market,  as has been the recent trend, dropped further this week,  as did the bulls and store steers."
"The fat cattle in the yarding were of a high standard with most descriptions well represented. There were a number of pens of quality cows with calves at foot, sold as the result of a recent property sale. Also included were a number of extremely lighweight yearlings and cows were presented in poor condition.

All cattle met keen competition. Trade yearlings sold to a much dearer price for the high quality offering. Restockers bought light young cattle at much improved values with the numbers available being insufficient for the local grower demand. The light calves in the offering attracted mainly grower demand. 

Bullocks were high yield potential and sold at fully firm prices. Cows met an equally strong demand to sell at fully firm rates. Heavy heifers were in greater numbers and sold at dearer prices for the quality yarding. Bulls also met stronger competition.

 A restocker paid the top sale price of 263.2c/kg for very light E muscled steer weaners. Light vealers calves sold in dollars per head, were bought by restockers at an estimated 305c/kg."
"The falling off in numbers continued as for the first time in many months cattle are getting hold of the fresh pasture growth in parts of the area. Many of the cattle yarded were in light condition but there were fresher cattle scattered through the offering. Cows and light calves and plainer yearlings were in the majority and there were few trade cattle or heavy steers or bullocks available.

There was a steady and unchanged market for light calves and yearling heifers with restockers busy on both descriptions. There were very few trade cattle but their price was also firm. The restocker yearling steers failed to maintain last sale rates but the lower quality may have been the reason.

Cows sold strongly at dearer prices and the lack of numbers available was a major reason for the rise in price. Bulls were cheaper as the demand weakened.

The top sale price was an estimated 160c/kg paid by a restocker for very well muscled steer calves."
"The fall in the yarding size was not apparently connected to the good falls of rain immediately prior to the sale as the cattle were yarded before the rain fell. 20 to 40ml of rain were received over the area and further to the north on the Tablelands. Quality continued to be plain with yearling cattle of light weights only being in the greatest numbers. Cows were in smaller numbers and the better yielding cows were very short supplied. There were no bullocks available while feeder steers were in fair numbers. Light vealers were yarded in small quantities.

Even though the rain was only light, it had the effect of stirring up the store cattle demand with restockers paying between 5c and 12c/kg for yearling steers and heifers. Light heifers to slaughter were also dearer but there was no change in the price of the few heavier yearling heifers to the trade. Light feeder steers were dearer in keeping with the trend in the restocker cattle.  

The price of the very light cows did not alter but any with a higher yield potential met a very strong demand to record dearer prices. The export heifers with weight were similarly dearer. The bull market showed a stronger tendency with a few better lines available.

The top sale price paid was 148.6c/kg for a single medium weight bullock."
"The fall in numbers was accompanied by a sudden increase in quality across most types of cattle, except for the cows. Most descriptions were available in the yarding but trade cattle and cows were again in lower numbers. There were some better types of medium weight bullocks yarded together with the better quality average of steer weaners. All the usual buyers attended the sale.

The market for the better young cattle was again strong with heifer vealers improving their price by the amount lost in the previous sale. The top quality steer weaners to restockers sold at fully firm rates but some of the plainer types were cheaper by 5c/kg. The good feeder steers were also fully firm but the plain bred cattle lost ground to a similar extent to the plain steer weaners. Trade heifers sold at fully firm rates and once again there were no yearling steers bought to kill.

There were more bullocks available and most were fairly well fattened. They sold to a slightly dearer trend with the younger ones meeting keen competition. For the third consecutive sale the cows showed a very firm trend, displaying a consistency not often seen. There was a very solid bull market with competition very keen indeed.

Top price in the sale was193.8c/kg for steer weaners bought to background for a feedlot."
"The fall in numbers is the normal occurrence at this time of the year. There were more finished cattle on offer, in most categories, with cows making up in excess of a third of the yarding. All the regular buyers were operating.

The market trend for fat cattle was towards dearer levels, with fat cattle in the North difficult to source at present. Yearlings with any finish sold to 3 and 4 cents per kilogram dearer,  while heifer veal remained fully firm. Steer weaners to restockers displayed a weakening  to be mostly 3c to 4c cheaper.

Only a few heavy steers were available but they sold at firm rates, while the reduced numbers of light bullocks also showed no alteration in price.

Cows were of better quality and sold  3c per kilogram dearer for medium and heavy weights  but the light boner and restocker cows, under 400kg, improved by up to 8c/kg, to average a 6c rise."
"The fall in numbers brought with it a very obvious drop in quality, with most descriptions except cows, not up to the past few weeks standard for quality. Plain yearlings were yarded in the greatest numbers. There were fair numbers of cows available, together with a reasonable supply of export heifers and light to medium weight bullocks. With the district needing another fall of rain to consolidate a spring season, the drop in quality coincided with the finish of the oat crops.

The best bred and conditioned yearling steers were bought by restockers at dearer prices, but the plainer bred and lighter conditioned yearling steers and heifers, sold at cheaper prices, with quality a major factor in the price fall. There were only a limited number of trade yearlings available, and they were also cheaper due to a drop in anticipated yield.

The bullock price was cheaper by 4c/kg for a good quality penning, therefore quality was not a factor in the price loss. The cow price was very steady with no weakening in values recorded. The bull market eased to a similar margin as bullock values, with export heifers also weakening in price.

The top price recorded was 229.2c/kg paid by a restocker for C2 yearling steers estimated to weigh 215kg liveweight."
"The extraordinary increase in the yarding size was caused by a number of factors combining to provide either a record yarding or close to it. A combination of dry weather, the rain in Queensland reducing available numbers, and the improving values were the 
factors accounting for the yarding size. There were 2000 cows of all weights yarded, and there were well over 1200 head of light vealers available. The balance were yearling cattle with a few bullocks and heavy steers as well as some fair pens of export heifers.

The usual regular buyers attended and the size of the yarding attracted many other buyers of restocker, feeder and slaughter cattle. The market for most young cattle was dearer with only one exception and that was in the light heifer vealers, which were a few cents per kilogram cheaper. Restocker demand for the young steer vealers and yearling steers, was sustained, with slaughter orders confined mainly to the heifer portions due to the strength of the prices on the steers.

The strength of the demand was repeated on all export cattle. Bullocks and heavy steers sold to a dearer trend as did the export heifers. All cows were considerably dearer with the light manufacturing types attracting considerable fattener enquiry. It is understood that these types are to be locked up and heavily supplementary fed.  Values on all cows varied between 5c and 15c/kg dearer, with the heavier, high yield cows showing the greatest increase in price. Bull quality was very plain and prices were marginally dearer.

The best sale price recorded was 172.2c/kg paid for a single medium weight bullock."
"The excellent rain in the past week reduced the size of the offering by 25%. The yarding included only a few vealers and there were no high yield cows offered. Cow numbers are at their lowest percentage of the yarding  for well over a year. All the usual buyers attended the sale.

The reduction in numbers led to a firm to marginally dearer trend in the market for yearling steers. All the yearling steers were bought by restockers. 

Yearling heifer demand improved to the stage where average price rises were 3c to 4c/kg  with a few individual sales up to 7c/kg dearer.

Heavy steer and bullock quality was of plain quality only, but they sold to a firm market.

The lack of high yield cows in the market put pressure on the plainer types, and forced a price rise of  2c/kg in the 2 and 3 score types. 

The prices paid for the better muscled bulls is consistent at an average approximating 104 c/kg."
"The elevation in numbers was quite extraordinary in such a short period but the sell off prior to winter is well documented each year. There were some very good cattle yarded but the majority was not well finished. Weaners led the numbers with cows also well represented and there were more pens of better quality cows available. Feeder steers were in good numbers also and there were very few trade cattle available for such a big yarding.

There were very few pens of cattle that held value in the market. Leading amongst those were a few pens of the absolute best quality steer weaners and also the same sort of quality in feeder steers held price well. Of the balance of the young stock the prices fell between 15c and 25c/kg with the drop in value most obvious in the heifer weaners. Restocker demand was restricted mainly to the better types or the very light weights with medium types losing most favour.

There were some quite well finished bullocks yarded and they sold at a marginally cheaper rate for the best but prices eased for plainer types and medium/ heavy steers. Cows sold to a fair demand considering the numbers. Light and boner cows were slightly easier in price while there was a greater price loss in many of the better yielding cows. Bull prices were firm enough for the best but cheaper for low yield cattle.

Top sale price was 225.2c/kg paid by a restocker for very light steer weaners under 160kgs."
"The early start to the winter continued to push good numbers of cattle into the auctions with the biggest percentage of weaner and vealer cattle so far this season. The weaner and vealer cattle were very good quality with the lots getting bigger and slightly heavier each week. The balance of the offering were plain conditioned and plain bred with the cow offering the lowest in condition so far this season. There were a few good lots of export heifers yarded but again the bullock, heavy steer and feeder cattle were short supplied.

There was once again a very strong restocker demand with the heavier steer weaners 270kgs and heavier, selling at fully firm rates. Weaners under that weight sold at cheaper rates compared to the previous sale. Heifer vealers were mostly firm but there were odd sales to 2c/kg cheaper mainly in very lightweight heifers. There were no trade weight cattle available. Domestic feeder steers were also only represented by odd lots.

The few bullocks of all ages and the feeder steers and secondary older steers were cheaper between 5c and 8c/kg under much reduced demand. Export heifers again lost ground while all cow descriptions were cheaper by 5c to 7c/kg, with a large percentage of that loss being put down to a lack of yield. The bull price was 10c/kg cheaper."
"The dry weather and the long winter, were certainly obvious in the offering, with plain and dry cattle in the majority, and very light yearling heifers, lacking condition providing a very big percentage of those plain cattle. 

The trend in the yearling cattle was for improved prices for the better trade cattle, which are in low numbers, and a cheaper set of values for the unfinished yearling heifers. Restocker yearling steers also, showed a weakening trend.

Export steers, light bullocks and cows, were fully firm, and the good selection of heavy bulls, sold to a stronger market."
"The drought was responsible for the biggest November yarding of cattle ever seen in Armidale as growers reduce numbers on the run up to Christmas when sale dates are severely limited. There were 750 cows and 450 young calves in the market with feeder steers and plain and light yearlings responsible for almost the balance of the yarding. Heavy steer and bullock numbers were limited but there were fair numbers of export heifers yarded.

The usual buyers attended the sale together with a greater number of potential store buyers attracted by the bigger yarding. The market trends were again variable with a considerable price rise seen in restocker and feeder steers. Young calves also met a much stronger demand for a dearer market but plain and light yearlings sold at firm rates.

The few bullocks available were not quite finished but they sold at similar prices to last sale. There was a sudden fall in the price of cows with all boner cows losing considerable price under a much weaker demand. The best of the cows suffered a similar loss but were slightly better treated than the boners. The bull market was unchanged.

The top sale price was 148.2c/kg paid for light weight bullocks."
"The decline in numbers continued, with the yarding reduced by 50%. It was a mixed quality and conditioned penning, including quite a few lightweight young cattle along with some well finished grown heifers and cows. There were a small number of trade and export processors on hand; however there was keen demand from restockers on lightweight young cattle.

Trends varied throughout the young cattle section and quality was a contributing factor in price change. Lightweight vealer steers to restock remained firm, getting to the end of supply. There was very little difference in the market trend for vealers heifers. Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend for a reduced quality penning that included some very light early weaned steers. There was little competition for medium and heavy weight steers to restock and feed, with no feedlot activity. This resulted in a much cheaper market trend. Lightweight yearling heifers to restock sold to a dearer trend, with increased competition. The few heifers showing enough finish for the trade sold to a cheaper trend.

There were no heavy grown steers offered. Well finished grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend. Despite there being limited competition for cows the market held up well, with an improvement in quality accounting for the positive price change."
"The current state of the cattle market led to the largest Spring offering for quite sometime. It was however a very mixed quality penning showing a great deal of variation in condition. There was an increased presence in the restocker and feedlot buying ranks while there was less processor representation.

Quality and breed were major contributors in the cheaper prices seen in the young cattle with market trends also weaker. The straight bred light and medium weight yearling steers held up reasonably well whereas the secondary quality and mixed breed lines were quite a bit cheaper.  This trend continued in to the light and medium weight yearling heifers with the exception being a single line of very light weights.

There was a very plain quality offering of Manufacturing steers penned. Comparatively speaking they sold quite well to the well bred well finished heavy grown steers. Those heavy grown steers sold to a slightly cheaper trend. The well finished grown heifers also sold to a slightly cheaper trend with some age and quality related price change. Restocker cows sold to on a firm to dearer market trend. The medium weights to process saw a firm to slightly dearer trend. The well finished heavy weight cows followed a similar trend. Heavy bulls carrying plenty of condition were well supplied with market trends generally cheaper while a quality improvement lifted some averages."
"The current handy season combined with good rain over the weekend saw numbers drop to their lowest level for the year so far. The condition of the offering was fairly plain with only a small number of well finished cattle available. The quality was also only average. Not all regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market was reasonably strong. Quality played a major part in market trends. Any cattle that were equal quality to last week, sold firm to dearer. Breed quality was also important with restockers paying little regard to muscle pattern. The plain quality cattle sold to a cheaper trend.

There were very few grown steers and heifers penned and quality was only average. However, they sold to a dearer trend. 

The plain condition cows sold to a cheaper trend with the better condition medium and heavyweight cows selling dearer."
"The continuing cheap prices saw the number of cattle yarded down again this week. The yarding consisted mainly of young cattle and an odd grown steer or heifer, as well as a few pens of cows.  Quality was very mixed in a market that saw restocker cattle sell firm to slightly dearer, while grown cattle sold to an easier trend with limited buyer competition.

Most of the young cattle went to restockers, with the exception of a few better finished vealers, which sold to an average price of 158.6c for the steers and 148c/kg for the heifers.  

Grown steers to processors made around 120c and 156.8c for the C2 and C3 grades, respectively, while those to restockers made 123.7c/kg on average.  Medium weight cows to process made from 98.2c to 110c, to average 102.25c/kg."
"The continued hot, dry weather forced increased numbers onto the market. There was a large penning of cows, with vealers and yearlings well supplied. The quality and condition of the offering was very mixed. There were a few lines of well finished cattle available, while the mixed quality nature of the offering was reflected in some large price changes. The usual processors and feedlotters were in attendance, however restocker demand was somewhat subdued.

Market trends through the young cattle were cheaper. Steer vealers to restockers were as much as 25c/kg easier and more in places where quality was an issue. Heifer vealers to the trade sold on a firm to cheaper market trend. Yearling steers through all weight classes were 14c to 20c cheaper with quality variations a major factor in some significant price reductions. All but the very best of the heifer yearlings suffered significantly cheaper trend, with plain quality heifers struggling to attract much interest. The good quality heifers suitable to feed were least affected.

Well finished heavy grown steers saw a cheaper trend of 10c/kg. The well finished grown heifers were much cheaper. The cow market suffered considerable losses with the best of the heavyweight cows as much as 30c/kg cheaper. Heavy bulls sold to a cheaper trend of 20c/kg and more in places."
"The considerable rise in numbers was evident as the weaner selling season reaches its peak. The biggest numbers yarded were weaner steers and vealer heifers, both of which were offered in good sized lines generally. Cows were also well represented but feeder steer yearling numbers have dropped with most having been sold in earlier months. Trade cattle and bullocks were in very low numbers but there were some fair lines of export heifers. 

Probably due to the big numbers of weaners and vealers being offered in the New England area currently, the weaner and vealer market was cheaper, steers to restockers by 5c to 6c, and heifer vealers made 7c to 12c/kg, with the heaviest heifers losing the most in price. There was a good demand for the steer weaners, but for the first year in some years, there was very limited outside the area. The few pens of tradeweight yearling heifers sold at steady prices.

There were not enough bullocks or heavy export steers yarded to frame a market. Export heifers sold at cheaper rates under more limited competition than usual while the heavier export weight feeder steers sold at unaltered prices. Cows sold strongly, with good competition on all descriptions including a restocker demand. Prices for most cows were steady but demand increased for the better types and a market to 4c/kg dearer resulted. No change was registered in the bull price."
"The considerable increase in the yarding size brought with it an improvement in quality across all descriptions. There were some very good lines of restocker yearling steers and feeder heifers, while there were also some heavy pens of cows. There were very few vealer cattle, with only a few small lines of bullocks and heavy steers. Feeder steers were also not as well represented. Overall, while the average quality was better than in recent weeks, there were still a fair percentage of plain conditioned cattle yarded.

A full field of buyers including a greater number of local restocker orders were in attendance, and the young cattle trend was dearer, or at worst fully firm. Yearling steers to restocker were to 12c/kg even taking into account the better quality. Yearling restocker heifers also showed improvement in price, while the feeders were firm to a little easier. The few light heifer vealers yarded sold at firm rates mainly to wholesalers. With some prospect of further rains, restockers were very keen to buy lightweight cattle.

The heavy steers and the few bullocks sold at firm values, as did the heavier export weight heifers. Cows showed a much better yield and sold at fully firm rates. There was a much stronger demand for bulls which recorded a 10c/kg rise in price."
"The condition of the plain yarding was not helped by the cold weather which has included numerous snow flurries. Breed quality was not up to the usual standard and the bulk of the yarding was weaners and yearling heifers. Cows and bullocks were short supplied but there was a fair yarding of lighter feeder steers. 

The trend in values with young catttle was mainly firm or dearer. Steer weaners to restockers stayed at similar rates to last sale as did the feeder steers. Heifer weaners and yearling heifers to the trade were dearer by 10c to 12c/kg under a keen enquiry. Restocker were very keen to buy weaner steers of all weights and breed qualities with the lack of numbers starting to become a serious worry for those wishing to restock. There were no trade steers yarded and only a few yearling restocker steers.

The very few bullocks yarded were mainly older and no market quote is possible. There were no heavy high yielding cows in the yarding but all other cows sold at firm prices. Heavier feeder steers were in strong demand and sold at dearer prices while the bull market price was much dearer."
"The bulk of the yarding were good quality feeder and restocker steers of medium and lightweights. Cows were in fair numbers but they were nearly all two and three fat score cattle. There were a few more heavy steers and bullocks yarded and their quality was fairly good. Splitter vealers were in lesser numbers than has been seen recently.

The usual buyers attended the sale. There were some types of cattle where the recent slip in the market was arrested but they were the exception. Light feeder steers and export heifers sold at firm rates while the heavier and better conditioned feeder steers and heifers sold at cheaper prices. Restocker steers sold at firm prices under a fair demand. Trade cattle were poorly represented in the sale.

Heavy steers and bullocks were marginally cheaper under a fairly well sustained demand. There were very few top yield cows yarded but the few that were yarded sold at cheaper prices. The balance of cows sold at firm prices for the first time for a number of weeks with buyers for these medium and boner types showing a little more enthusiasm. Bulls sold at firm prices with an odd bull selling to a cent or two dearer.

The top sale price was 229.2c/kg paid by a restocker for light weight steer vealers."
"The bulk of the killable yarding were heifers and cows this week, with very few steers of any weight offered. Quality was generally plain and the yarding also contained a very high percentage of  light, store cattle most of which received attention from Restockers. 
It was fairly obvious that Vendors are holding back their well finished cattle, in hopeful anticipation of better values in the New Year.

Any cattle displaying reasonable yield potential sold to a dearer trend, this included yearlings, cows, bulls and heavy steers.  The plain, dry cattle battled to maintain last sale rates."
"The breed quality of the yarding was improved this week but the fat quality is slipping due to the run of very heavy frosts currently being experienced. There were good numbers of weaners and yearlings yarded even though the end of the weaner season is well in sight. Cows were in fair numbers but they carried less finish than usual. Bullocks and heavy steers were again short for numbers and the fat quality was plain without exception. The bad frosts at the present are unusual so early in the winter season and fears are held that the winter therefore may be long and hard.

The market trend on young cattle was firm to dearer with the usual buyers in attendance and a few more local buyers were trying to buy cattle to feed on oat crops. The steer weaners to restock and the heifer vealers to slaughter sold to a dearer trend with steers 4c to 7c/kg dearer and heifer vealers 4c/kg dearer. The drop in numbers for the week in the north seems to have been responsible to the upsurge in price. Yearling feeder steers however stayed fully firm under good enquiry.

Heavy steers and bullocks even though numbers were light were in less demand and values slipped considerably . The quality drop was partly responsible but a genuine fall in prices paid was obvious. The same situation applied to the heavier feeder steers of plain quality. The cows sold at an uneven market with an easier trend noticed in some patches. But by the end of the sale the rates averaged much the same as the previous sale. Bulls sold at a steady and even price."
"The biggest yarding of cattle seen in August in Armidale was also one of the lightest conditioned yardings for some years with prime cattle restricted to only a handful of pens and single sales. Yearling and weaner cattle were in the greatest numbers while there was also a very big offering of cows in calf, as growers chose to sell rather than feed stock. Breed quality was also down with the exception of a number of pens of light conditioned but well bred steers. There were not enough heavy steers or bullocks to provide a reliable quote while export feeder steers were also in limited numbers.

 As a general comment the trend in the market was cheaper but there were some pens of the very best bred yearling steers to restockers and the same quality in feeder steers that stayed at fully firm prices compared to the previous sale. Most young cattle however varied between 5c and 12c/kg cheaper.

In the export section bidding on cows particularly was somewhat restricted with one major export abattoirs closing for maintenance for one week from August 16th. With the exception of just a few of the heaviest cows the market was cheaper for medium and heavy lines but the very light boner cows stayed at firm rates under fair competition. The bull market was considerably cheaper.

The best sale price was 144.6c/kg paid for heavy steers and for light bullocks."
"The bigger yardings are continuing with little sign of a reduction and little sign of a break in the season. There were numbers of plain cattle yarded as has been the situation for some months but this week also saw a number of good quality cattle in most categories. Weaner and vealer cattle were in very large numbers followed by cows. Trade cattle and heavy steers and bullocks continue to be very short supplied.

There were a number of new orders in the market for quality steer weaners and as a result the best steer weaners were dearer. Plainer types and heifer vealers sold at cheaper rates following a big increase in availability. Trade cattle sold at almost firm rates but quality was well down on recent sales and buyers were reluctant to drop their minimum quality standard. Restocker and feeder interest was confined to the best quality only and the plain bred cattle therefore sold at cheaper prices.

There were a few pens of well finished heavy bullocks which sold at firm prices compared to other northern sales this week as there were none yarded in Armidale last week. The cow market surprised some observers as the bulk sold at fully firm rates with odd pens of quality slightly dearer. It could be that the rain in southern Queensland reduced supply in that State and created steady market in some northern markets. 

The top sale price was 158.4c/kg paid by a restocker for quality steer weaners."
"The bigger yarding contained over 700 weaners with the annual weaner sell-off now in full swing and the prices being  received for them also pushing the sale numbers up. Quality of the weaners was good but the breed quality was not quite up to last weeks level. The balance of the yarding were  yearlings and feeder steers with cows and bullocks in lesser numbers than usual. Quality in the older cattle was similar to last sale with the exception of some outstanding quality export weight feeder steers and that quality is reflected in the prices received.

Following  last weeks very strong market for steer and heifer weaners and vealers the market for the steer portion was very well maintained for the best quality cattle but there was an easing in price for the heifer vealers and some of the lower quality weaner steers. Trade yearlings held their market while some of the best bred yearling steers were selling to a dearer trend to feed lots and restockers. Again 95 % of the yearling steers were picked up by restockers and feeders.

Competition for the heavier steers and light bullocks was as keen as ever but yields are dropping as growers are marketing cattle earlier in order to catch the strong prices. The cow market is solid but once again the quality is falling a little. Many growers are weaning calves and immediately marketing the cows to take advantage of the good rates offered. The better bulls appear to be meeting a slowly increasing market."
"The big numbers continued and once again cows and vealers made up the bulk. There was also a large offering of very mixed quality yearling heifers. Overall the quality was fair to good with increased numbers of well finished young cattle available. All regular buyers were in attendance with increased restocker activity noticeable. The market firm to dearer for most categories.

There was a good quality offering of vealer steers, most of which were purchased by restockers. The heavy weights displaying improved quality sold to a dearer trend of 6c/kg. The light and medium weights sold firm to dearer although there were more plainer quality lots offered. Heifer vealers were also well sought by both restockers and processors with the market trend 5c to 6c dearer. Odd 3 scores to butchers sold slightly cheaper although this was quality related. Increased competition from restockers saw yearling steers sell to a dearer trend, up 3c to 5c/kg. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, up 3c to 7c/kg, with a big line of lightly muscled heifers selling very strongly. The 3 score trade heifers remained firm.

The small number of heavy steers were slightly cheaper, while grown heifers sold firm to 6c/kg dearer with quality showing an improvement. Rain saw restocker activity increase on the plain condition cows resulting in a slightly dearer trend with this carrying through to the plain cows to slaughter. Overall the cow market was firm to 2c/kg dearer with the best heavy cows realising larger gains."
"The big increase in numbers happens at this time in most years with the prospect of winter and a lack of pasture growth in the air. Quality of the yarding with a few exceptions was plain but there were some pens of well bred feeder and restocker steers available. Weaners, vealers and yearlings made up the biggest proportion of the yarding while most other cattle were reasonably well represented. Cows were again in low numbers while there were plenty of feeder steers but not as many well bred steers yarded.

There was a weakness in heifer vealers and in some plainer types of steer weaners. Demand for the heifers and vealers fell away sharply as the bigger numbers start to come forward. Restocker steer weaners sold strongly again for all the better quality types and the yearling steers were in light supply. Feeder steers sold well at level prices.

Any bullocks showing good yield sold at very firm prices but there were some numbers of steers with low yield and demand for them fell away once again as their numbers increase. Cows maintained last weeks price levels as did the bulls.

The highest price paid for any cattle was 226.2c/kg for restocker steer weaners weighing 280kg."
"The big fall in numbers over the last two weeks is difficult to understand. The two possible causes are that the numbers have stopped for the winter season or that the advent of the GST has pushed cattle to the market earlier than usual this year. The quality of the yarding was very plain with the biggest proportion of the cattle being weaners and yearlings. There were very good cow numbers but they were mostly very lightweight and very low yielding. Heavy steers and bullocks were lightly supplied again.

The  bulk of the vealer heifers were lightweight splitter calves and the demand for them was stronger than last week with a subsequent price rise occurring. Weaner steers and restocker yearling steers sold to a much quieter enquiry to sell up to 6c/kg cheaper. The plainer types in the steer yearlings sold at closer to firm than their better quality counterparts.

There was little change obvious in the light bullock price but with only a few pens yarded comparisons are difficult to make. The cow market was unchanged but with the quality so much down on last week. There were virtually no high yielding cows in the market and they are not expected for the rest of the winter season. There were no B muscle bulls yarded."
"The best rain for some months reduced the yarding with young cattle best represented. There were a few grown steers and heifers along with around 120 cows. The regular orders were in place.

The quality of the young cattle was very mixed with some well finished yearlings suitable to the trade, however most went to restock and feed orders. Trends were dearer throughout with vealers to the processors up 3c/kg. Steers and heifers to restockers saw dearer prices, the lightweight classes sold on a dollars per head basis with the heifer portion making well in excess of the live weight sales. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed averaged 7c to 22c/kg dearer with restockers buoyed by the rain. Yearling heifers to the trade were up to 16c dearer, while those to restock and feed were 4c to 11c/kg dearer.

Heavy steers sold at cheaper prices with the fall related to age, most carrying 6 teeth or more. Plain condition cows sold to a dearer trend with most going to restockers. There was little but quality related changes in the better condition medium and heavyweight cows."
"The average quality was very wintery, and the bulk of it over 75%, were heifer calves, yearling heifers or cows. The usual regular buying strength operated, with the demand for most categories strengthening as the numbers that were available decreased.

There was strong demand for heifer veal, light heifers and trade heifers.  Price increases up to 10c/kg but averaged 5c and 6c dearer. Restock yearling steers which have any breed of quality are difficult to source and sold from 2c to 4c/kg dearer.

It is difficult to quote a price change on heavy steers or bullocks which sold in such short numbers, but the inclination was to a slightly dearer trend.  There were over 500 cows  offered of a fair quality, and they sold on a fully firm market under keen competition. Some numbers of pens were off crop, and empty."
"The average quality was very similar the the last sale, with some good big lines of restocker weaners and yearlings available. Cows were in fair numbers although their percentage of the market is reducing each week as the district gets closer to calving time. Heavy steers and bullocks were poorly represented as were feeder steers and heifers. There were some handy quality trade heifers available mostly in the heavier weight ranges.

The usual buyers attended the sale together with a few extra restockers who were drawn by some advertised store yearlings. The restocker steer weaners and yearlings sold keenly at unchanged rates, while heifer weaners and yearlings to restockers, sold at dearer prices. Trade cattle prices were unaltered.

The few pens of heavy steers and light bullocks, together with all the older male cattle, sold at cheaper prices as demand diminished. The demand for all classes within the cow market, was keener with restocker demand also increasing. The average price rise was 2c to 3c/kg on a fair quality yarding. The bull and older heifer price remained static.

The top price in the sale was 201.2c/kg paid for very lightweight steer yearlings bought by a restocker."
"The average quality of the yarding was down on last sale with the exception of the cows, which were yarded in good numbers and quality. Light vealer heifers and yearling heifers were well supplied. Restocker and yearling feeder steers were in fair numbers, but were still not enough to satisfy the strong demand. There were fair numbers of grown steers and light bullocks, but no medium or heavy weights were yarded. The quality and muscle in the bulls were well below anything seen for weeks.

The usual buyers created a variable market in the young cattle with light vealers under 200kg dearer by 3c or 4c/kg and this rise applied both to cattle to kill, or restock. Medium trade heifers sold at firm to dearer rates, while the lightweights were cheaper. Restocker and feeder yearling steers did not alter in price.

Heavy steers and bullocks were fairly well finished and met a stronger enquiry to record dearer prices. The plainer types in the older steers sold at just about the same rates as the previous sale. There was considerable irregularity in the cow market with prices difficult to predict from pen to pen. There were some pens selling at firm prices, but overall there was an average drop in values of between 4c and 5c/kg. It is difficult to pin-point the reason for the irregularity other than that some buyers have a fair number on hand for the start of the next week. The bulls available were very plain quality and this accounted for the price falls."
"The average quality both for breed and for fat was well back on earlier sales with a very large percentage of light yearlings more suitable for restockers. Bullocks and heavy steers and cows were not well supplied. The usual buyers were in attendance but the bidding was much less enthusiastic than in earlier sales.

The trend in the market was cheaper with trade heifers down considerably and the plainest and lightest were up to 15c/kg cheaper. Restocker and feeder steers and the very light yearling heifers lost considerable momentum not only because of the drop in quality but the dryer weather had a bearing. The increase in numbers across northern sales coupled with the Monday holiday has also had some affect on market demand.

The heavy steers and light bullocks in the market were quite good yield but suffered price falls averaging 10c/kg across all weights. The cow market was the least affected with a loss of 2 to 3c/kg common for plainer types but the better cows held on the be fully firm

The top sale price was 254.2c/kg paid for light vealers."
"The area had some important follow up rain but the yarding size did not change much for the last sale of the financial year. The bulk of the offering was cattle suitable for restockers but there were a few pens of export cows and bullocks and there were no tradeweight yearlings. There were quite a number of pens of PTIC cows yarded which were bought by both restockers and abattoirs. Weaner cattle were in the lowest percentage of the season with most having been sold prior to the rain commencing in the district.

There was a strong and ever increasing demand for all young cattle from restockers resulting in prices that were dearer on all descriptions. Weaner cattle and yearling steers sold mainly to restockers, the weaners averaging 5c/kg dearer, the better yearling steers up to 20c/kg dearer. Domestic weight feeder steers made similar gains to the weaners. A quote on trade cattle is not possible due to the almost total lack of supply.

Bullocks were not plentiful but their quality and finish was very good. All export cattle were dearer with bullocks 4c/kg stronger. There were some excellent export heifers yarded and they sold between firm and 4c/kg dearer. Cows bought by processors were also 5c to 9c dearer while restockers were responsible for creating price rises of up to 23c/kg in many sales. The bull market was fully firm. Heavier feeder steers again met a strong enquiry and were again dearer in price."
"The approach of the colder weather and the continuing dry weather pushed more cattle onto the market and this trend is repeated every year at this time. All categories except trade yearlings were represented. Quality was for the most part fair, but there were numbers of cattle yarded which needed more condition. Weaners were again in increasing supply.

The usual buying orders were represented but not all bought cattle. The better bred half of the restocker weaner steers and the heifer vealers were cheaper by 5c/kg, while the secondary cattle were cheaper by 10c/kg. There were only a few pens of plain trade cattle yarded, making it difficult to quote a market change. Demand for restocker weaner steers was still solid even though prices were a little easier.

Young bullocks were represented by only a few good pens but values changed very little. Export feeder steers sold strongly at firm rates. Cow prices were fully firm for most but there were odd pens of low yielding types which were a little cheaper."
"The Anzac day public holiday brought about a large reduction in numbers. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering with limited supplies in the other categories. The quality of the offering was only fair to good, while the condition was mostly on the lean side. There was reduced competition in all categories due mostly to the low numbers.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with light weight weaner steers to restockers sold firm to slightly dearer with the large price change mostly quality related. Light weight weaner heifers sold to a dearer trend of as much as 20c/kg as restockers took to good quality light weight cattle to reduce their buy in price. Medium weight vealer and weaner heifers sold to a cheaper trend of up to 14c/kg. Medium weight yearling steers sold to a cheaper trend for a fairly plain quality penning. A good supply of heavy weight feeder steers sold only slightly cheaper for the well-bred lines, more so for the plainer quality lots. Yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends. Secondary quality young cattle failed to attract much demand from either restockers or feedlotters.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. Grown heifers generally sold to cheaper trends. Demand from processors was weaker for cows with market trends cheaper, up to 20c/kg on the better cows. Very plain condition cows attracted little competition, while restockers were active on joined cows in store condition."
"The anticipated annual autumn sell off of cattle began with the biggest offering since Christmas. The yarding included 220 quality breeding female cattle sold by open auction, which made an average in the range of $1000/head. The balance of the yarding was of fair quality, but some pens were being sold before they were properly fattened. Weaner numbers increased as did yearling heifers, but trade steers were lightly supplied. Cows and quality bullocks were also in reduced numbers.

Most of the usual buyers attended but not all were active in a market that varied from just firm to considerably cheaper. Steer and heifer weaners sold well but at marginally cheaper rates, while trade and restocker yearlings were 3c to 5c/head easier. Demand for quality from restockers was again a continuing feature of the market.

Export weight cattle suffered the greatest price losses with bullocks and heavy steers over 475kg selling cheaper by 6c to 8c/kg with the plainer types most affected. Demand for the smaller yarding of cows was weaker and values were down by 8c to 13c/kg. A similar price drop was recorded on bulls while heavy heifers were cheaper, but not to the same extent.

Top recorded sale price was 204.2c/kg paid for steer weaner to restock."
"The advent of the new financial year was the major reason for numbers to increase by over 100%. There was little difference in quality, but there were less vealers and weaners available and the bulk of the yarding were yearlings and feeder steers. Cows were in fair numbers, but their quality and yield were down a little.

There was less competition in the market for restocker cattle as the season rapidly deteriorates. The trend in the market varied very considerably with most young cattle showing a cheaper trend that averaged 6c to 7c/kg. Some of the better quality feeder steers, including the heavier types were firm, but off-type and restocker steers also showed a similar cheapening tendency.

Most bullocks sold at firm prices, but there were odd pens at a slightly easier price. Off-type heavy steers cheapened, but there were no top quality heavy steers yarded. The cow market was cheaper across the board following the very strong market of last week. Some cows were cheaper by up to 20c, but the overall average drop was 7c to 9c/kg. The drop in price was not confined to any particular type. Heavy export heifers sold well to be fully firm.

Top price in the sale was 189.6c/kg for medium feeder steers."
"The  quality of the cows and yearling heifers showed a slight improvement with all other grades remaining the same as last sale. Cows and young cattle were the bulk of the yarding. Apart from a few pens of heavy steers and export heifers the remainder were plain, light young cattle. All the regular buyers attended the sale.

The market for most young heifers to slaughter improved an average 5c/kg. Young steers to restockers were again strong and showrd no price change as the enquiry for these types holds up. Trade demand for light heifers around 200kg live continues to strengthen.

Heavy steers sold at firm rates but there were not many available. The cow market was  assisted by a definate shortage of numbers and a helpful Australian dollar rate. Prices  continue to escalate with rates averaging 7c to 8s/kg dearer this week, but rises in excess of 15c/kg have been common in recent weeks."

"Surprisingly for this time of the year numbers increased with a larger offering of vealers and grown heifers. The quality of the offering realised quite a variation as did the condition. There was a small offering of very well finished grown steers, while for the most part the yarding lacked condition. All regular buyers were in attendance with the market trend and price changes varying with the quality.

Vealer steers sold firm to cheaper, unable to emulate the very strong market witnessed last week, the breed quality was a major factor in the change in price. Heifer vealers to processors sold firm to 3c/kg dearer with demand strong. Restockers were also active on suitable lines of well bred cattle. The 3 score vealer heifers to butchers did not have the quality of the previous sale and sold cheaper as a result. Yearling steers to restock and feed also dropped in quality resulting in a cheaper trend, down 3c to 4c/kg. Trade yearling heifers sold firm to 5c/kg cheaper with fewer quality lots available.

The better quality heavy steers sold at dearer rates while the balance sold at unchanged rates. There were a larger number of grown heifers penned although quality and condition varied. There was extra feedlot activity in the market and this helped push the well finished quality cattle to a dearer trend, up 5c/kg with the balance firm. Plainer condition cows received competition between restockers and processors which was strong with the market showing a dearer trend, up 4c to 6c/kg while the better condition cows sold firm to 4c/kg dearer."
"Supply lifted for a very mixed conditioned yarding that contained a large percentage of yearlings and a few vealers. There were not enough steers or bullocks to quote and there was a fair number of cows. Young cattle suitable for the trade were scarce while restocker and feeder buyers were well catered for.

Light weight heifer vealers and light yearling heifers that were purchased by the trade sold considerably dearer. Young steers purchased by restocker and feeder buyers met strong demand and sold at much higher levels.  There were only a few trade steers suitable for processing and they sold from 200c to 235c/kg. The C3 trade heifers lost 4c to 11c/kg with the heavy end being least affected. Feeder heifers were firm to dearer while young heifers to restock gained up to 13c/kg.

Grown heifers lifted by 3c and topped at 187c/kg. There was a mixed conditioned penning of cows and prices were a few cents either side of firm."
"Supply lifted and quality and condition was very mixed throughout. There were a few vealers and trade yearlings with plain conditioned young cattle being quiet plentifull. Cow numbers increased and steers and bullocks were scarce.

The regular buyers competed and demand from all sectors was weaker.  Light weight steer vealers purchased for the paddock sold firm enough while those weighing over 240 cheapened by 15c/kg. Unfinished steer yearlings purchased by the same orders sold firm enough with the better bred angus steers holding the average up. Plain heifers sold considerably cheaper. 

The few steers and bullocks that were yarded cheapened a shade and they sold between 160c and 175c/kg. There was a handy penning of cows and they met a cheaper trend to be back by 1c to 9c/kg while some sales were more affected."
"Supply increased, with yearlings well represented and a fair number of grown cattle yarded. The quality of the offering was fair to good with the majority of the young cattle suited to the restockers. The regular orders were in place and demand from restockers was high.

The market for lightweight yearling steers to restock was dearer, with prices on average 12c to 31c/kg dearer. There was little change in the market for the medium weight steers. Heifer yearlings saw some variation in trends, with lightweight trade 2c/kg cheaper. Restocker heifers remained firm however the average quality was down. Well finished medium weights to the trade were 2c/kg dearer.

The majority of the heavy steers penned fell into the manufacturing classes due to dentition, with prices stronger. The cow market was very strong with quality also a factor in dearer prices. The trend for cows to slaughter was up 3c to 10c/kg. Restocker competition was high for plainer condition cows making to 154c/kg."
"Supply increased as quality and condition were mixed. There was a handy penning of butcher vealers and a penning of yearlings in variable condition.  Steer vealers and yearlings suited to restockers were well supplied with well-bred unfinished steer vealers were particularly well supplied.


Light weight steer vealers purchased for the paddock lifted by 10c/kg while the medium and heavy end sold firm to slightly easier. Steer yearlings purchased by restockers met a cheaper trend with the light weights being most affected.  Butcher weight heifer vealers lifted by 3c while light heifer vealers lost 7c/kg. Feeder steers were mainly firm while trade steers to process lost 2c/kg. Trade heifers were 6c/kg dearer.

Export cattle were well supplied and most were showing plenty of finish.  Steers and bullocks sold firm to 3c to 4c/kg dearer. Restockers were keen to purchase the store conditioned cows at dearer rates to the previous sale and they sold from 120c to 168c/kg. Most of the slaughter cows gained 1c to 11c/kg."
"Supply fell and condition was fairly plain over nearly all the yarding.  Both vealers of mixed condition and cows were by far in the greater numbers. Most of the yearling cattle sold to restockers and feeders with processors picking up the odd pen.  

The regular buyers provided support and the market held up well.  Restockers were keen to purchase the steer vealers at stronger values of 2c to 10c/kg. Light heifer vealers to the trade and to restock gained 1c to 3c/kg. Trade steers to restock were fully firm and they sold 3c to 4c /kg stronger to the lot feeders. Trade heifers were 1c to 2c/kg dearer to restock and feed.  

Grown heifers held strong values with the better finished pens reaching 168c/kg. There were only a few grown steers and bullocks on offer and they were on the plain side and difficult to quote. Two score cows reached dearer levels with good competition from restockers. The better covered three and four score cows showed little price change. Bull quality was plain and they sold stronger."
"Storm rains and a hint of a change in seasonal conditions saw a small sale to commence markets for the new year. Quality and condition varied greatly, with some very well finished supplementary fed grown steers and heifers. There was little condition and not much weight in the majority of the young cattle. Well finished cows were in short supply. There was limited processor competition, however restockers and feedlotters were active.

Restockers bouyed by the storms and a green carpet were active through the young cattle. Market trends were however generally cheaper than pre Christmas levels with quality making up most of that. Breed and breeding were factor in some of the wide price ranges.

There have no well finished grown steers or heifers for quite some time to enable a market comparison. The plainer quality and condition grown heifers sold to cheaper trends mostly. An isolated sale to a restocker close to firm. Plain condition cows to restock and feed experienced little change in value compared to before the break. The well finished cows were as much as 15c/kg dearer. Little change in the bull market."
"Steady rainfall over the past week reduced numbers significantly. The quality of the offering was mixed with most categories represented. The very good seasonal conditions being experienced saw well finished cattle in fair numbers with the percentage increasing. There was reduced feedlot and processor competition; however demand from those operating remained high. Restocker activity was high with demand very strong.

There were varying trends in the young cattle market with breed and quality impacting on price. Lightweight Angus vealers to restock sold to a much dearer trend, while breed variations had a negative effect on prices in some classes. Heifer vealers to process sold to a dearer trend, up 3c to 12c/kg. There were some extraordinary sales in the lightweight yearling steers to restock with poor quality steers breaking the 300c/kg barrier. There was little change in the market for medium weights to restock and feed with heavy feeders suffering from reduced competition to show a cheaper trend. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed also saw little change in the market trend. Well finished medium weight heifers to the trade sold to a cheaper trend.

There was an increased supply of well finished heavy grown steers with quality also showing an improvement. The market trend was dearer up 5c to 23c/kg with the heaviest steers showing the greatest improvement in both price and quality. The cow market recovered most of last weekâ€™s losses to show a dearer trend. The overall quality of the cow offering also showed improvement."
"Steady rain fell overnight and throughout the sale in a smaller yarding of 1340 cattle. Quality was unchanged on last sale and most descriptions were well represented.  A full field of Buyers were responsible for an improved market in all the cattle for slaughter. Vealers, trade yearlings and export cattle with the the trade heifers 3 score (under 400kg's) provided the greatest improvement.
       
The restock steer calves, even with the rain struggled to maintain last sale rates and there was a cheaper trend in the yearling off steers, 2 score, which have been going to Restockers."
"Steady numbers yarded this week with quality the same as last sale. Some good bullocks off oat crops were yarded and a reasonable number of medium quality cows were offered. Light vealers were in slightly higher numbers and the usual high percentage of yearlings were available. The regular buyers were in attendance and the market trend was again firm to dearer.

Light heifer vealers weighing under 200kg sold to a very keen demand with price rises averaging 12c/kg with all these cattle going to slaughter. Steer weaners and the lighter yearling steers also met a very keen restocker demand to sell at dearer rates while trade heifers showed similar price increase. 

There were numbers of bullocks weighing over 540kg in the sale and while they met keen demand there was no price alteration.The cow market was very solid, but the yarding lacked the high yield cattle of previous weeks. The market for cows however, held fully firm to a shade stronger.  A feature in the sale was the increase week by week in the numbers of export heifers coming forward.

The yarding of bulls was both increased in numbers and increased in quality while the price remained steady. The demand for steers up to two teeth is strengthening daily, but there are  signs that supply is diminishing."
"Somewhat surprisingly, there was a significant reduction in numbers. This with no rain and no forecast in sight. Cows were well represented, along with a very mixed quality penning of young cattle. There were some very well bred lines of yearlings penned, however with weaner sales coming up the quality of the vealers was below previous weeks. There was increased processor competition on cows, while restocker activity was somewhat subdued.

Market trends through the young cattle were generally cheaper, with average prices easing a considerable amount when taking breed and quality into account. Steer vealers to restockers saw a cheaper trend of 30c/kg and more in places, with a number of lots decreasing to reach a dollar a kilogram. The heifer portion followed a similar trend. Light and medium weight yearling steers were much cheaper in general. However, there was a large line of very well bred Angus steers that sold to a restocker. The increase in price of that class was purely breed and quality related. Well bred and well presented yearling heifers to feed sold to a cheaper trend, up to 8c/kg, while the secondary and plain quality heifers to restock and feed incurred greater price reductions.

There were insufficient well finished grown steers or heifers for a quote. Despite the extra competition, the cow market sold to cheaper trends of 10c to 20c/kg, as weight of numbers continues the downward pressure on prices. There were cheaper trends through the bull market."
"Some very useful rainfall reduced the offering by 350 head. All categories were represented in a fair to good quality penning. There were very few well finished young cattle, some very good heavy cows and a line of certified grainfed heavy grown steers. The regular processors were in attendance, however not all operated due to the limited number of suitable cattle. There were some strong restocker orders, with confidence boosted by the rain.

Dearer trends were the order of the day through the young cattle, with light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed showing strong gains, particularly the light weights. The best of the price increases were for the very light weights. The dearer trend carried through to the yearling heifers with the trend 15c to 20c/kg dearer, and more in places. Once again it was the lighter weights that saw the greatest improvement. There were a number of pens of good condition light weight vealers straight off the cow that attracted strong competition from both processors and restockers, although there was nothing comparable to the previous sale to frame a market quote.

The grain fed heavy steers sold strongly on the back of the certification, attracting strong competition between export processors. The cow market also saw a dearer trend, with averages 5c to 8c/kg higher. The trend for heavy cows was on the lower end, with the larger improvement in the medium weight categories."
"Some very good rainfall on the eastern side contributed to a drop in numbers despite no sale next week prior to Easter. Young cattle made up the bulk of what was a fair to good quality offering of cattle in fair condition. Prime cattle were in limited numbers and all regular processor and feedlot orders were in place and operating.

The young cattle market was good across most grades. Vealer steers to restockers sold firm to 5c cheaper to range from 160c to 200c/kg. Heifer vealers sold to processors at rates firm to 3c dearer to average close to 167c/kg, while the 3 score trade heifers sold slightly cheaper. Vealer heifers to restock and feed also sold firm to slightly dearer. Competition between feedlot buyers was very strong on yearling steers with the market showing a dearer trend of 4c to 7c to average close to 170c/kg. Light yearling heifers sold 1c to 3c/kg cheaper to both the trade and feedlots. The medium and heavyweight heifer yearlings to the trade and feed sold firm to 3c/kg dearer.

There were few heavyweight grown steers offered. Grown steers to feed sold to a dearer trend and averaged between 160c to 172c/kg. Grown heifers also sold to a dearer trend. The cow market experienced little change as slaughter cows sold firm to slightly cheaper while restocker cows were firm and a little dearer for the better quality lines. Heavyweight bulls held mostly firm."
"Some light rain in the area saw numbers reduced this week with vealers, yearling heifers and cows in fair supply while there was only an odd grown steer through the sale. There was a better quality yarding of cattle with increased numbers of well-finished vealers and yearlings.

Good falls of rain in the south west of the state saw extra buyers enter the market to buy good quality weaner steers. The increased competition bumped prices up by 12c/kg with the biggest percentage of the steers leaving the area.  An extra buyer from the north helped the vealer market improve by 7c to 10c and the feeder steer market on special lines to 15c/kg. Some handy lines of yearling heifers met a solid market to improve on last weeks sale.

The export cattle consisted mainly of cows with a few lines of heifers and only an odd steer. There was insufficient numbers of steers for a reliable quote, however heifers sold on a strong market.  The yarding of cows consisted of increased numbers of better quality and yielding types, which helped to maintain stronger prices, while lighter cows struggled to reach last weeks rates.   

Top price of the sale was for restocker weaner steers at 217.6c/kg."
"Some handy storms and patches of heavy hail disrupted numbers at receival time, and the yarding was therefore much smaller than originally estimated. Quality was average or below but there was a number of pens of quality light trade weight heifers available. Restocker cattle were in fair supply and the steer portion varied from very lightweights to medium weight domestic feeders. Cows were reasonably well supplied but there were very few high yielding types yarded. There were a number of quality heavy bulls available.

Not all regular buyers attended, no doubt due to the lack of available numbers. Even with the smaller buying field, there was little alteration in the values of any young cattle. Restocker demand was steady and mainly local, while the few pens of good trade heifers sold strongly. 

There were only small lots of bullocks yarded but they sold at firm rates, as did all cows and heavy export heifers. Bull prices were very solid for the good selection yarded.

The top sale price was 241.2c/kg paid for light steer vealers to restock."
"Some good rain and very rough weather over the last week were responsible for the halving of the yarding size. The greatest majority of numbers were yearling cattle with all the yearling steers being bought by restockers in a very strong showing. The yearling heifers mostly went to slaughter. There were only a few cows available and there were also only 25 lightweight bullocks in the yarding.

The usual regular buyers attended together with an increased number of restocker orders that were responsible for a very big rise in price on yearling steers. The rise in price on the trade heifers was not quite so big but it was substantial. With such a small offering the bulk of orders were not filled at the end of the day.

The few bullocks sold were at even prices. There were not enough cows yarded to give a reliable quote with only one pen of four score cows available.

Top price in the sale was 228.2c/kg paid by a restocker for yearling steers weighing 295kg."
"Similar numbers were yarded to the last sale with the quality fairly plain on young cattle and a few good pens of heavy steers and light bullocks. The good numbers of cows, though,  didn't have the same yield as last sale. The usual buyer numbers were in attendance.

All yearlings, for slaughter or restocking, sold at very much the same values as last sale.

Export cattle, as has been the pattern set earlier in the week, fell away in value quite sharply, due to uncertainty in Asian markets at the moment."
"Similar numbers to last week in an offering that saw all catergories represented. Cows were well supplied and there were increased numbers of heavy steers in the offering. Once again young cattle dominated the penning. The condition of the offering was only fair as the effects of some heavy frosts take control. Most regular buying orders were in place.

The quality of the young cattle was fair to good with a few pens of well finished heifer yearlings. The market for vealers cattle was cheaper. The steers to restockers sold 3c to 8c/kg cheaper. Heifer vealers also sold to a cheaper trend with 2 scores down 5c and the better conditioned 3 scores up to 10c/kg cheaper. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold to a cheaper trend. Heifer yearlings to restockers and feeders sold at slightly dearer rates with a quality improvement. Trade yearling heifers also sold dearer for quality.

There were a few more heavy steers in the offering with quality and age also showing an improvement. This resulted in a dearer market with the 2 tooth steers seeing the best of it. There were not as many cows penned this week. Overall there was not a lot of top in the offering; generally the quality was below last week. Taking this into account there was little change in the market. As the cold weather takes control yields are on the decline. Bulls sold to a cheaper trend."
"Similar numbers to last sale with the quality of the slaughter cattle improving weekly. Over half the yard were heifers weighing from 240 to 400 kgs, and the numbers of cows yarded were good style, high yield types. Up to 3 inches of rain had a big effect in the market with all young cattle 3c to 6c/kg dearer, heavy steers 2c to 5c/kg dearer, and the cows showing dramatic rises, particularily the heavy and best which were 11c to 14c/kg  dearer, and 5c and 6 c/kg up for lightweights. Restockers showed interest, but there were few cattle available for them."
"Shearing in full progress and the Agquip field days combined to interfere with the normal flow of numbers and provided the smallest offering for some years. Any finished cattle were in the minority in a very plain quality yarding of mostly restocker cattle. Not all the regular buyers attended due to the small yarding.

The market was difficult to judge due to the lack of numbers however it appeared that the only real alteration in price compared to last sale was caused by either quality improvement or reduction. There were plenty of restocker orders at the sale but most went away disappointed due to the lack of supply."
"Sale cattle numbers were back to the bare bones following the recent good rains and the heavy sell off of cattle over the past three years. There were clear indications that sale numbers will remain at extremely low levels, at least, until January at the earliest. Every description in the sale was obviously poorly represented by numbers, but yearling steers and plain light yearlings heifers made up the bulk of the offering. Overall quality was plain with the exception of just a few pens of supplementary fed yearlings.

The lack of numbers created serious problems for buyers and the market for all descriptions of young cattle, therefore were at worst fully firm, at best restocker and feeder lots were dearer by anything up to 10c/kg.

There were no heavy steers or bullocks available but the few cows and export heifers sold at steady rates compared to the previous week. Bulls sold at stronger prices and were to 10c/kg dearer."
"Reduced numbers brought about by good rainfall and the usual sell off period wind down. All grades were represented with the exception of heavy steers and grown heifers. The quality of the offering was fair to good however well finished cattle were. All the usual buyers were in attendance and restocker orders were strong.

The young cattle market showed a dearer trend through all grades. Steer vealers to restockers were 5c dearer on the lightweights and up to 16c/kg on heavier steers. Heifer vealers were also well sought by both processors and backgrounders with the market improving by 8c to 14c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 5c/kg. Heifer yearlings were firm to 4c/kg dearer with restockers, feedlots and processors competing strongly on the fresher condition cattle.

There were no heavy steers purchased by processors with feedlot orders purchasing all steers with 2 or more teeth. Restockers were very active on suitable cows with the market showing a dearer trend of 8c to 12c/kg. This trend carried into the plain condition cows to slaughter also. For the most part the 3 and 4 score cows to process experienced little change, as some of the better medium weight cows were dearer though."
"Recent rain has steadied the numbers down with an anticipation of greater receivals as autumn and winter approach. There were some handy quality cattle in all grades available,  but also plenty of unfinished stock with all the usual buyers in attendance. The numbers of cows in the offering was again lower.

The general trend in the market was towards the cheaper side with buyer enthusiasm for some slaughter cattle waning slightly.

The heifer veal, restocker yearling steers and the best medium and heavy cows all remained at near enough to firm rates.

The balance of yearling cattle varied between firm and 2c to- 3c/kg cheaper.

The 3 score cows and 3 and 4 score bullocks were cheaper with buyers complaining that yields have fallen in recent weeks."
"Rainfall over the district in the past week contributed to the reduction of the yarding by 30%. The quality of the offering was very mixed with some well finished yearlings, some handy cows and, showing how patchy the season is, there was quite a run of one brand light vealers being sold due to a lack of water.

The market was generally dearer with restockers and feedlots continuing to purchase the bulk of the young cattle and also the grown steers and heifers that lack sufficient cover to process.

Light and medium weight vealer steers sold 5c to 8c dearer, the heifer portion 2c/kg dearer. Vealers heifers over 200kg were generally firm to 2c/kg dearer although there was some quality variation evident. Yearlings were also dearer, up 3c to 6c/kg with the heifer grades seeing the best of the rise.

Grown steers and heifers followed the dearer trend, with feedlots active on the underdone cattle. Steers were 3c to 5c/kg dearer and the heifers saw similar rises and more in places with feedlots showing little discount for lighter muscle grades.

The market for cows was dearer, up 3c to 5c/kg with an isolated sale showing greater rises. The quality was not quite up to last week however."
"Rainfall of up to 100mm over the past week saw the numbers decimated. The quality of the offering was only fair, although most grades were represented. Not all regular buyers were in attendance.

The very low numbers in combination with the quality make it difficult to give a meaningful market quote. Restockers, however showed confidence and competed strongly on steers showing a bit of quality. They were more reluctant to compete on the lessor quality cattle. Processors held rates at levels of other sales taking quality issues into account."
"Rainfall of 60 to 80mm over the past week and the forecast of more to come reduced numbers. There were some good quality cattle penned although the condition was fairly plain. There were a small number of well finished yearlings and cows in the offering. Processor competition was reduced although there was some extra restocker competition in attendance.

Restocker steer yearlings sold at rates firm to dearer with little regard shown for quality, weight seemingly the most important criteria. Light heifer yearlings attracted both processor and restocker competition and sold to a slightly dearer trend once again weight not confirmation the issue. Medium weight heifer yearlings did not attract as much restocker activity resulting in those grades selling to a cheaper trend.

There were insufficient quality heavy steers for a quote. Plenty of light steers with 2 or more teeth attracted restocker competition and sold to a dearer trend. Medium and heavy cows followed the cheaper trend of sales earlier this week, down 4c to 5c/kg. Restocker cows show a dearer trend although this is attributed to a vast improvement in quality."
"Rain throughout the tablelands saw numbers fall to 886 head, down by 1,000. Young cattle and cows made up a large percentage of the yarding.  The yarding of young cattle consisted of a good supply of vealer steers and heifers and light yearlings. Quality was fairly plain with mainly 1 and 2 score cattle offered. A fair number of cattle went to southern and western areas.

The market lifted considerably mainly due to the wide spread rain throughout the state. There was only an odd pen that went to the trade, the remainder of vealers and yearlings were acquired by feeders and restockers. Restocker vealer steers were up to 40c dearer with light weights toping at 206.2c/kg. Restocker vealer heifers ranged from 103c to 140c, to up by 20c/kg. Yearling feeder steers held firm toping at 184c/kg.  

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows, along with a few pens of grown heifers. Most of the cows were 1 and 2 scores, with a few pens of medium and heavy cows through the sale. Medium and heavy cows were up by 20c, toping at 150c, while light restocker cows were 25c dearer selling from 85c to 114c/kg."
"Rain the day before the sale once again disrupted the flow of cattle. Quality was not up to last sale on any of the cattle with the majority of the yarding comprising of light and very light heifer yearlings and a reasonable percentage of cows. Heavy steers and bullocks were in small lots only while there were a number of restocker steers, but they were very light weights and plain breed quality. There were a number of pens of cows and calves at the end of the sale and they sold up to $628.

The usual regular buyers attended the sale and the market trend for the bulk of the offering was firm. The very light heifer yearlings 170 to 250kg were dearer while yearling steers did not alter. All the light steers went back to restockers.

The few bullocks and heavy steers sold unchanged for prices as did the cows which were just a little down on quality. The bull market was slightly disappointing with most values 6c/kg cheaper."
"Rain reduced the penning with a large number of cancellations. A very mixed quality offering of young cattle made up a large percentage of the offering. There were some very good heavy weight grown steers and heifers along with a fair penning of cows. There was reduced processor attendance, with restockers and some feedlotters active.

Market trends varied through the young cattle and there was some quality related price change. Vealer steers to restock mostly sold to cheaper trends, while there was an odd breed related dearer sale. The heifer vealers to restock sold to a significantly cheaper trend. Light weight yearling steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend. Insufficient medium weights to quote, the heavy weights to restock and feed substantially cheaper under reduced competition. Yearling heifers to restock and feed were much cheaper with quality contributing. An odd sale to the trade were dearer.

Heavy grown steers sold to cheaper trends with quality and reduced competition factors. Some very well finished heavy grown heifers sold to dearer trends to processors. The cow market saw a firm to slightly dearer market trend.

Market reporter, James Armitage."
"Rain reduced numbers with this report comparing to the sale two weeks ago. Yearlings and cows made up the bulk of the offering with limited numbers in all other categories. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance, however feedlot competition was reduced. Overall the quality and condition of the cattle was mixed throughout all classes.

Most trends through the young cattle were cheaper. Vealers to both the trade and restockers were down 10c to 20c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed also sold to a cheaper trend, down 6c to 14c with quality an issue. Weight for age was seen as a factor in the lighter steers. Yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend for the lightweights, down 1c to 11c/kg. Medium weights to restock were less affected down 4c/kg, while the same weight to feed sold to a dearer trend.

Heavy grown steers sold cheaper, down 1c to 5c. There were not many heavy cows penned and they sold to a firm trend. The majority of the cows fell into the medium weight classes with the trend firm to 6c/kg dearer."
"Rain reduced numbers by 200 head. The quality of the offering was fair to good, comprising a good percentage of well finished cattle in each category. A feature was some very good heavy grown steers and several pens of high quality yearling feeder steers. Processor activity was limited by the numbers however competition and demand from restockers and feeders was very high.

There were dearer trends throughout all classes of young cattle, with strong gains through the steer portion. A limited penning of steer vealers saw prices improve on the last sale, the difference being in the increased weight of the steers. Yearling steers to restock and feed also saw significant price improvement, with the quality also contributing. Heifer yearlings to feed sold to a dearer trend to average 9c/kg dearer.

The heavy grown steers were keenly sought by processors however with nothing from the previous sale to compare to there is no trend to quote. The quality of the plain condition cows was a major factor in the large lift in price. The better condition cows were also dearer."
"Rain across the supply area contributed to a reduction in numbers. There was a fair selection of cows, while young cattle made up the bulk of the offering. The quality varied throughout with condition fair to good. A full field of buyers were operating and competition was strong.

Vealers sold to a dearer trend with heifers to the trade 4c to 6c/kg dearer. The steer portion to restockers followed a similar trend. A mixed quality penning of yearling steers attracted strong demand from restockers with medium weights showing a dearer trend, up 10c/kg. The lighter weights experienced greater improvement with quality and some very lightweights contributing to price increases. A slightly improved quality offering of lightweight yearling heifers to processors sold to a dearer trend, up 4c/kg, once again average weight was a contributor to price increases. Feedlotters were active on medium and heavy heifers carrying good finish, while the medium weight trade heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 7c/kg.

There was a limited supply of good quality heavy grown steers on offer with the market dearer, up 3c to 4c/kg. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend although the quality and weight was down on the previous week. The cow market continued its upward trend with prices dearer by 2c to 4c/kg. Overall the average quality and weight of the penning was down as was the estimated yield of the top priced cows."
"Quality was well below last sale on all the young cattle in a yarding increased by 55 head. Export cattle--bullocks,cows and bulls, however, were more plentiful, better quality and dearer. Not much alteration on average in yearling values, with the drop in quality accounting for the apparent fall in price on heifers. Competition for the heavy export cattle was extremely strong, with Operators appreciating the quality improvement."
"Quality was well above the previous sale with many more heavy steers and bullocks yarded than usual. Feeder steers and heifers were very well represented while cows were also in big numbers. Vealers were also yarded in good numbers with their average weight quite a deal heavier than the previous sale. Also yarded were 150 cows pregnancy tested all of which were bought by restockers.

The market generally was strong but there was considerable variation in some types. Trade heifers sold to a dearer trend for all weights as did the feeder steers and some of the feeder heifers. Some of the lesser quality yearling and weaner steers to restockers sold marginally cheaper as did most vealer heifers and splitter vealer calves. Demand for all restocker cattle was keen enough but there were signs of a little more caution being observed in the face of the drying weather.

There were some good bullocks yarded and demand for them was strong. The market for all the better slaughter bullocks was therefore slightly dearer. Enquiry for suitable export bullocks is strengthening but the improved values do not seem to have been successful in pushing many more on to the market. There were some very good heavy cows yarded and they met very strong competition and recorded reasonable price rises. The medium and light cows sold at firm prices under good enquiry.

The top price of the sale was for a pen of light vealers weighing 170kg realising a price of 193.6c/kg."
"Quality was very similar to last sale with the exception of the cows that were improved in yield by a small margin. Feeder cattle and light calves and cows were the biggest proportion of the yarding. Bullocks were light supplied while trade cattle were in reasonable numbers. Restocker yearling steers were not well supplied but the demand following the rain was very strong. All the usual regular buyers were in attendance.

It was yet another strong market for feeder steers and restocker steers with the recent valuable rains having intensified the enquiry. Restockers were at the sale in numbers but the supply was well below the demand. The light vealers under 200kg sold at very solid and unchanged rates as did the trade yearling heifers. Quality in the trade cattle at this time is not good as some of the heifers yarded are starting to show a little too much physical maturity for the trade.

The light cow market lost some ground with less competition available. The medium and heavy cows sold at very much the same rates as last week on the improved quality cows. There were only a few bullocks yarded and they were not top quality or yield. They sold well however at very similar rates to last sale. There were plenty of good bulls yarded and their price was firm."
"Quality was very plain in the smaller yarding with growers apparently holding the quality cattle for later sales. Feeder steers and restocker yearlings were very well supplied and there were more heavy steers and bullocks yarded than usual. The recent drop in cow prices cut their availability by half while there were basically no trade cattle in the offering.

The usual young cattle buyers were in attendance and the trend in the market was firm. Prices for young cattle were in fact cheaper than last week but the drop in quality was totally responsible. Restockers were very keen to buy while those looking for quality bred steers were disappointed by the lack of supply.

The usual export orders were represented and prices were mostly steady with just a few exceptions. Bullocks and heavy steers to slughter were fully firm, while cows were firm to slightly easier for the small offering. There were few quality bulls yarded and prices fell due to the lower yields."
"Quality was very plain in an increased yarding, which was mainly made up of light yearlings. There were a number of pens of quality bullocks yarded together with just a few pens of high yield cows. There were very few trade cattle yarded but heavier and older heifers were in fair numbers.

The usual regular buyers attended and the drop in buyer enthusiasm was clear. The trend in the market, therefore was mainly cheaper. A few lots of yearling steers sold at firm rates but generally restocker and feeder steers were easier by an average of 4c/kg. Lightweight heifer yearlings both to slaughter and to restock, were cheaper by 12c to 20c/kg with only odd lots of restocker types selling at last weeks rates.

Demand for bullocks was fairly well maintained, with prices firm to slightly cheaper. Heavy export and older heifers also lost some favour to record cheaper prices. After many weeks of an improving market, cows met a weaker demand to record average losses of 12c to 14c/kg. Bull prices eased slightly. 

Top sale price was 251.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight yearling steers."
"Quality was very plain in a smaller offering, with the best finished cattle being a few pens of quality trade yearling heifers together with a number of high yield cows and export weight heifers. The balance of the yarding was plain grown steers, lightweight yearling heifers and bulls.

The lack of numbers created a steady market with the only cattle showing an increased price, being trade heifers which were up to 5c/kg dearer. Yearling cattle including steers and heifers which sold at fully firm rates, with restocker demand being well maintained.

There were no bullocks yarded but the cow price was fully firm on all descriptions. Bulls and export heifers also sold at steady rates and there were only two pens of feeder steers yarded."
"Quality was unchanged in the smaller yarding with few prime cattle yarded, and a big percentage of light yearling cattle of both sexes. There were only a few older male cattle while cows were in fair numbers and fewer calves were yarded. With little or no grain assisted cattle available the quality and yield of the trade cattle was only average.

There was a slightly brighter note in the market with most cattle firm and some cattle slightly dearer. Amongst the cattle which showed a dearer trend were very light yearlings both for slaughter and to restock and a few trade heifers. The restocker demand was restricted to light and cheaper yearlings with buyers taking the risk on a few easy to feed cattle.

The few bullocks available met a good demand and were marginally dearer while light cows and the better boner cows sold to a dearer trend. The better yielding cows sold at firm rates as did the plainer bulls. The demand for the light cows is strong, particularly those in calf, and it appears to be slowly strengthening.

The top sale price was 143.8c/kg paid for a pen of lightweight bullocks."
"Quality was unchanged in a smaller offering with the usual buyers in attendance. Heifers and cows made up most of the yarding while steers were not in as big a percentage as per usual. Heavy steers and bullocks were short in number while light vealers were available only in very small lots. Well-muscled bulls were in fair numbers. 

The market again performed well on the young cattle with a fully firm trend for the very light splitter calves followed by a solid performance by the quality yearling feeder steers and the restocker yearling steers. Demand for any grass eaters continues to swell but they are extremely difficult to find. Trade and lightweight yearling heifers sold to a marginally dearer trend. A few pens of plain bred yearling steers sold at slightly cheaper prices.

There were only just enough heavy steers and bullocks yarded to formulate a market comparison but the trend was fully firm and the demand was largely unsatisfied. Cows sold at extremely irregular rates with most cows selling at fully firm to slightly dearer prices. However, there were some sales that made it very hard to understand why they sold at either a dearer or a cheaper rate. Bulls sold very well indeed at a dearer price than last sale."
"Quality was similar to the last sale other than with a few pens of cows and a number of pens of weaner steers, which were better bred. Weaners and yearling steers suitable for restockers were well supplied. There were very few genuine trade weight cattle yarded, while heavy steers and bullocks were in fair numbers but they varied widely for breed quality and yield. Export heifers were well supplied and most were better finished than at the previous sale.

Trends varied in the market which was attended by the usual regular fat stock buyers. Local restockers were in greater numbers than usual, perhaps in anticipation of some rain. Steer weaners and restocker yearling steers met a strong demand and were dearer by between 5c and 8c/kg generally. Trade and weaner heifers were firm to slightly dearer, while there were not enough trade steers yarded for a quote. Domestic weight feeder steers were fully firm but were in limited number. 

Young bullocks provided they had a high yield potential, sold at firm rates. Older bullocks and secondary type heavy steers lost some favour with buyers and were 4c/kg cheaper. Export heifers were very solid in price, while cows were just firm, even though there were odd signs of weakening on a few pens. Export weight feeder steers sold steadily but the bull market cheapened by an average of 4c/kg.

The top sale price of the day was 209.6c/kg paid by a restocker for quality steer weaners."
"Quality was plainer on most descriptions of cattle, however with the exception of the top heavy cows which were of a little better type. The big numbers of weaners appears to be dropping off, but there were plenty of yearlings and cows in the yarding. The usual buyers attended the sale and probably due to the lower numbers recently the market was very solid and consistent.

Vealer and yearling heifers sold well to be 2c to 3 c/kg dearer as were the restocker yearling and grown steers. Heavy steers sold at slightly dearer rates, but there was no quote on bullocks. The market for cows was very consistent with price variations occurring only due to quality changes. Restockers were active on 2 score cows.

Feeder and restocker steers, older than weaners are still creating considerable interest in the market with no sign of any price reductions. Since the spring prices for these cattle have remained high by comparison to the fat market."
"Quality was plainer across most cattle with the numbers of cattle properly finished being very much restricted as compared to earlier weeks. The numbers of light vealers and weaners has begun to increase with the districts weaner sales approaching also. Cows and heavy steers and bullocks were in restricted numbers but yearlings and feeder cattle were again well supplied. The overall fall in quality had a definite affect on the market as a whole.

Light vealers under 200kg sold to a cheaper rate while heifer vealers over 200kg also cheapened. Weaner steers to restockers kept close to last sale rates as did the younger feeder steers and the yearling steers bought by restockers. Trade weight and lighter heifer yearlings sold at fully firm rates. Demand for quality young cattle was again very strong but the supply was down considerably.

There were hardly enough heavy steers or bullocks available for a reliable quote but the heavier feeder steers were cheaper both through a drop in quality and also through a drop in demand. There were a few pens of the absolute top steers however that sold at very close to last sale prices. The demand for cows weakened and all but the few best sold at cheaper rates, as did all weights in the bull market."
"Quality was plain with the middle of winter bringing out a much greater percentage of unfinished cattle. The bulk of the offering was yearlings and most of those were either suitable for restockers or feeder heifers. Bullocks and feeder steers were short supplied, as were heavy steers and bullocks. Included at the conclusion of the sale was a clearance sale of 86 yearling Angus bulls, with local growers buying all of them for future herd duties.

Any restocker cattle sold at firm to 5c/kg dearer under very keen demand. All young cattle sold to slaughter at cheaper rates with the lower quality available being totally responsible for the price fall. There was a solid demand for feeder heifers which sold at cheaper rates for the lower quality offering.

The few cows and young bullocks on offer sold at relatively firm prices, but with only a few exceptions, the yield was reduced. Feeder steers were not as well supplied as usual but the best quality sold steadily while the plainer lines were discounted. 

The top price in the sale was 232.2c/kg paid on two occasions by restockers for lightweight steer weaners."
"Quality was only average and as has become the norm, by far the greatest percentage of the offering were yearlings. Only a limited number of heavy steers and bullocks were yarded and the same shortage of numbers applied to the cow yarding. There were a number of pens of restocker steers yarded but they were mainly fairly plain bred cattle.

A full field of export buyers attended for the first time since the Christmas break. Prices were fully firm for most of the young cattle but there were a few exceptions. Feeder heifers were cheaper by 3c/kg while all other young cattle remained unaltered. 
Bull prices stayed firm but all other export cattle were cheaper. Bullocks were cheaper by 4c to 6c/kg while cows and heavy heifers were cheaper by up to 4c/kg. There was no alteration in bull values but heavy export weight steers were dearer by 2c/kg."
"Quality was of a high standard in the majority of the yarding. Most categories except feeder steers were fairly represented. Yearlings made up the greater part of the offering. Cows were once again in good numbers followed by a few pens of quality bullocks and fair numbers of export heifers. Restocker steers were in lesser numbers than usual.

Young cattle prices were generally cheaper in the face of much bigger Northern yardings. Best treated in an otherwise cheaper market, were trade heifers, yearling steers and very lightweight restocker yearlings, all of which were to 7c/kg easier. Very lighweight vealers were 15c/kg cheaper while some very plain bred young cattle were  much cheaper than in recent sales. 

Bullocks and export heifers were cheaper by 6c/kg. In an extraordinary price reversal, cows to slaughter were between 20c and 35c/kg cheaper to average a 28c/kg price fall, perhaps the greatest single fall seen for many years. The very heavy yardings of cows in southern Queensland during the week, put enormous pressure on the cow market, with the resulting price slump the result. The bull price showed a similar cheaper trend. Included in the yarding were 40 cows and calves which sold at a price per head up to $960/head.

Light vealer calves to slaughter topped the sale at 234.2c/kg, paid for calves estimated to weigh 80kg liveweight."
"Quality was not to the standard of the previous sale with considerably less good quality heavy cows yarded. Restockers were active in the market purchasing a large percentage of the trade cattle. All the regular buyers were in attendance and operated to full capacity. 

All forms of trade cattle experienced strong support during the beginning and middle of the sale, however interest waned in the latter part of the sale with a number of good quality vealer and yearling pens passed in. The weaker demand was attributed in some way to a slight easing of price. Vealer steers averaged just over 200c by means of a number of well-presented pens making over 210c/kg. Yearling steers eased 8c to average 170.9c while, heifers enjoyed solid restocker enquiry to average 162.5c/kg for the lightweights.

A limited number of grown steers were yarded and prices slipped in line with a decline in quality. Many of the medium weights were poorly conditioned and these were suitably discounted, of the best-muscled lines, prices averaged 158.7c/kg

The quality of the cows was not to the standard of the previous week and values for both medium and heavyweights struggled to hold firm. Many of the cows were carrying plenty of condition, with the heavier cows receiving the largest discounts. There were some well-bred medium weight cows that induced keen interest from restockers. Heavyweight bulls ranged from 125c 130c/kg.

The top price of 212.2c/kg was paid for 9, C3 vealer steers estimated to weigh 230kg."
"Quality was not outstanding but there were some well finished cattle available. The bulk of the offering was light vealers and yearlings with a fair number of feeder steers and a reasonable selection of grown steers and light bullocks available. The cow numbers were not as great as in some other weeks but their quality was fairly high. The quality of the bulls continues to be very average indeed with very few high yielders being yarded.

The usual buyers were in attendance, making the market very consistent. The light vealers and trade cattle sold strongly with little variation in price. Feeder steers were also unchanged but there were some unattractive plain heifers that sold at cheaper rates. The market for plain heifers appears to be slipping away, as wholesalers lose interest due to increased numbers and the drying season has begun to keep restocker buyers out of the market. On the other hand, restocker type steers are still selling at consistently strong rates.

The bullocks again sold well with some well finished cattle amongst the yarding although they were mostly in small lots only. The cow market continues to be a feature of sales with a fairly remarkable consistency of price occurring each week. Export heifers are selling very well, provided they are heavy enough and have high yield potential."
"Quality was much the same as the previous sale but there were less weaner cattle and cows but a  lot more feeder steers of fair to good quality. There were fair numbers of heavy steers yarded with almost all of them going to the lot feeders while genuine bullocks were again short supplied. Of the weaners yarded the bulk were heifers which is most likely an indication that the steers are being held back for the forthcoming New England weaner sales. Trade cattle were again under supplied and again most of the yearling off steers went to feedlots. After there having being a sale for two weeks this report defers to the sale of 13/04/00.

After the two week break in sales there was some concern for the market but any worries were overcome early in the sale. The market continued on a strong and steady level for most descriptions except steer weaners which lost ground to the extent of 4c or 5c/kg for the heavier weaners in particular. Local growers were not as keen as they have been previously following some light early frost in parts of the area. The heifer vealers and the trade and restocker and young feeder steers held their price well. 

There were only two pens of genuine bullocks yarded but they sold strongly together with fair numbers of heavy steers. The cow market was markedly dearer with very keen competition a feature of the sale. Most cows sold 3c to 4 c/kg dearer with a number of pens of quality cows scattered throughout the market. The bulls were down in yield but still sold at solid rates."
"Quality was much improved with that improvement more obvious as the season progresses. A feature of the sale was the yarding of a large number of quality export feeder steers, most of which were sold in bigger lines. Cows were also well represented as were lightweight yearling heifers. There were only a few pens of bullocks and trade steers that were once again poorly supplied. There were also a number of pens of early steer weaners, which are amongst the first of the season to date.

A full field of buyers saw a relatively steady market on young stock. Lightweight domestic feeder steers and heifers sold at improved rates, while steer weaners and the light vealers were firm also. Plainer trade heifers were firm to slightly cheaper. Restocker demand was strong for the few pens of steer weaners but as yet the numbers being offered are limited.

Export cattle demand strengthened to the stage where the best yielding cows sold at slightly dearer rates, while the plainer and lighter types were fully firm. There were limited numbers of bullocks that sold, these were also dearer. Export heifers were firm as were the bulls. Export weight feeder steers met a very keen demand and sold between 3c and 5c/kg dearer."
"Quality was much better in an increased yarding, with better finished acttle available in all categories. As against last week, all Buyers were in attendance but the market was quite variable all through. Most categories with the exception of heifers were a little stronger with the improvement in export cattle a feature of the sale.

Restockers were active on yearling steers while export feeder steers, as in other Northern sales this week met a strong demand. On yearling stock, 3 score, Buyers appeared to be very selective this week."
"Quality was mixed in a smaller yarding, which is not uncommon at this time of the year on the New England, with some producers traditionally offloading in the first sale of the new financial year and then holding stock through to the spring. Once again young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering, with limited numbers of other grown cattle. There was a much smaller gallery of buyers, with several processor and restocker orders absent. This impacted quite heavily on the market in places.

Vealer steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 8c to 10c/kg. Two of the three regular processors on vealer heifers were in attendance and, as a result, the suitable light and medium weights remained firm. This carried through to the restocker heifers also. A better quality penning of light and medium weight yearling steers that included young pre-weaned cattle in the lightweight class sold to a dearer trend, with strong average price changes evident as a result. Heavy feeders remained firm with quality related price changes. Yearling heifers suffered from a lack of demand and competition to show substantial price reductions, with the secondary quality lots attracting little interest.

There were some very well finished mixed age heavy grown steers on offer, however there was nothing from the previous sale to make a market comparison. The cow market suffered from reduced processor competition, as well as a drop in quality to show cheaper trends throughout. The very best of the heavyweights that showed good yield potential were the least affected, while those with weight but a lack of yield were much cheaper."
"Quality was marginally improved in another small yarding with the bulk of the offering being yearlings of all weights and qualities, together with some good pens of PTIC cows which were bought at open auction by local growers.  There were no bullocks or heavy steers yarded, and there were no vealers or feeder cattle available.

A limited field of buyers attended and the market trend was firm or cheaper.  Most restocker cattle were easier by 7c/kg but a number of pens of well bred yearling steers sold at closer to firm prices. The yearling heifers were cheaper both in restocker types and in the few pens to slaughter. 

The PTIC cows sold at open auction, made similar prices to recent localised sales but the slaughter cows were cheaper. Bulls sold at unchanged rates."
"Quality was lacking in the majority of the yarding when compared to the big improvement of the previous sale. There were a few pens of well finished cattle but generally the balance of the yarding was plainer bred and lighter in condition. Heifers were in the greatest numbers and there were some good pens of feeder steers. Cows were also fairly well supplied but there were virtually no trade cattle available. Weaner and yearling steers suitable for restocker were in reasonable numbers.

There was a big field of buyers of young cattle but there was a variety seen in the market trends. All yearling heifers were cheaper by an average of 5c/kg, but weaner steer, yearling steers and domestic feeder steers all remained steady in price.

Export cattle again sold well but there were no younger bullocks to frame a market. Medium and lightweight cows were fully firm while the better heavy cow price was up to 6c/kg dearer under strong demand. Export feeder steers were also fully firm and heavily muscled bulls showed a good price rise."
"Quality was fair to good in the second last sale before the Christmas break. Yearlings were again in the major numbers but all other descriptions were well represented. Yield potential showed a marked improvement in both heavy steers bullocks and cows.  There were very good numbers of quality heavy export heifers available. Trade heifers were in fair numbers but there was a drop in availability of feeder and restocker yearling steers.

The enquiry for young cattle was well maintained for most descriptions. Yearling trade heifers met extra competition to sell at prices above the previous sale. Trade steers sold at fully firm rates while restocker and feeder steers were firm. Some restocker yearling steers were a little heavier than last sale but their price was well maintained. Light vealers were under supplied but firm in price.

Heavy steers and bullocks sold to a dearer trend of up to 7c/kg and buyers received an increase in yield for the extra price paid. Heavy export heifers and cows sold for dearer prices but the improved yield was also the reason. Bulls were slightly cheaper under a less active demand.

Restockers paid the top sale price of 234.2c/kg for a pen of light steer yearlings."
"Quality was fair in the young cattle which included a high percentage of weaner and vealer calves with all the steer calves bought by Restockers, and the majority of heifer calves going to slaughter. 

The quality in export cattle was plain, with very few heavy cows yarded.

Only the top quality and conditioned weaner steer calves were firm with the secondary types and all heifer calves losing value. Both yearling and grown steers were easier, again most going to restockers while medium bullocks sold up to the rates of  last sale. 

Cows again, met less and less buyer interest, to lose further ground while the  heavy bulls did not alter in price by much.

Restocker purchases accounted for 40% of the yarding and all their purchases were steer calves or off quality yearling steers."
"Quality was fair in the increased yarding with cows and feeder steers in the greatest supply. There were also good numbers of light vealers yarded together with fair numbers of lightweight bullocks. All the usual buyers attended the sale together with a few more restockers looking for light yearling steers.

There was a very steady market available right through the yarding of young cattle. The demand for feeder steers was much greater than in recent weeks and they sold at very steady prices except for some of the best breed quality cattle, which registered slightly dearer prices. The demand for the light veal improved, as did the quality with prices above last week. Trade cattle prices were unchanged.

Bullocks sold to a keen enquiry and were just a little dearer in price even though average yield was no higher. There was little change in the cow market with the quality of the light and medium types a little better but the heavier cows dropped sharply in yield. Heavy export heifers sold at firm rates while the best of the bulls sold at a dearer rate.

Top sale price was 223.2c/kg paid for light heifer vealers."
"Quality was down with yearlings again the dominant numbers. The high percentage of very lightweight yearlings that were yarded in recent weeks, were not available this week. Cows were in fair numbers while bullocks were short supplied. Feeder and restocker cattle were in reasonable numbers as were export heifers.

The demand for trade and restocker yearlings fell away to a large extent following a week of heavy frost and high winds. All yearlings both to restock and to the trade, were cheaper by an average of 5c/kg. Light calves sold at firm rates to slaughter and to restockers.

Heavy steers, bullocks, all cows and bulls sold to equally strong competition at fully firm prices. There were a number of outstanding, high yielding export heifers yarded, which sold at dearer prices under a very keen demand. There was no alteration in bull prices.

Light steer calves to slaughter made the top price of the day at 249.2c/kg."
"Quality was considerably improved with export weight cattle in fair numbers. Trade heifers were well represented while feeder and restocker steer yearlings were in slightly smaller lots than usual. Lightweight vealers were not well represented but feeder steers were in fair supply.

Improved quality on young cattle prompted an increase in values with yearling heifers to the trade selling up to 13c/kg dearer. Feeder and restocker steers sold at steady rates, while light vealers were dearer in most sales. Gains on young cattle prices were attributed to buyers anticipating rain.

Heavy steers and bullocks were better finished but they sold to a steady market. Heavy export heifers were dearer, while the cow market increased by up to 12c/kg for an average 8c/kg improvement. The improved cow price carried on a trend seen at other sales earlier in the week. Bull prices were unchanged.

The top sale price of 239.2c/kg was paid by a restocker for very lightweight steer vealers."
"Quality was again very plain on most of the cattle with only a very few cattle better than medium condition. There were 50 cows and calves offered together with fair numbers of yearlings and dry cows but with very few bullocks, heavy steers or trade cattle. There were some young calves yarded but they were in lesser numbers than last sale.

The market trend was consistently cheaper with very few cattle selling at last sale prices. The bulk of the young cattle sold at between 10 and 20c/kg cheaper with only a few plain heifer yearlings selling at anywhere near firm prices. 

The bullocks and older steers were unfinished and sold at very much cheaper rates as did the medium and heavy cows. The light boner cows were cheaper but did not suffer the same degree of price loss as did the heavier lines. The few feeder steers available were well down in quality and sold at much cheaper rates.

The top sale price was 139.6c/kg paid for a heavy bull to slaughter."
"Quality was again plain with some recent rain keeping the yarding size down. Manufacturing cows, weaners and yearlings made up most of the numbers, while there were a few pens of both feeder steers and bullocks. For the first time for some weeks there were very few high yielding cows in the yarding.

There was a much dearer trend seen in all young cattle with both restockers and wholesalers competing very strongly. The very sudden rise in values over vealers, weaners and yearlings has been possibly the most rapid seen for very many years, and in many cases that price rise has been upwards of 50c/kg and more.

In the export cattle, there was a decrease in interest seen from some northern abattoirs and as a result the bullock market lost some ground. The better types of cows were only just firm but the light manufacturing cow under 400kg liveweight, sold between 10c/kg and 20c/kg dearer with some assistance coming from restocker fatteners. Bulls and heavy heifers maintained last sale prices.

The best price achieved was 205.6c/kg paid for lightweight steers weaners bought by a restocker."
"Quality was again fairly plain with not much variation between this and last week. The exception appeared in the cows and restocker yearling steers and grown steers which dropped some of last weeks quality. The usual regular buyers attended the sale.

There were very few trade cattle yarded but they held their value compared to the last sale. There were plenty of light vealers yarded which also stayed firm, but restocker yearling steers met a quieter demand to be 2c to 3c/kg cheaper.

Bullocks and heavy steers were only fair in quality but sold at firm rates, some going to restockers. There appears to still be a strong enquiry for finished bullocks but supply is limited.

There was no change in the cow market with all categories meeting a very strong enquiry."
"Quality varied widely from a number of pens of very high yielding cows, down to some plain bred, light conditioned yearlings. Heavier export heifers were in fair numbers while there were only small lots of bullocks yarded. Restocker yearling and vealer steers were not well supplied, as were lightweight vealers.

The usual regular buyers attended together with a strong contingent of restocker buyers. The market for most young cattle remained fully firm while trade steers, in small lots only, gained some value under stronger demand. Restockers also bid strongly with a focus on lightweight steers and heifers.

There were just enough light bullocks yarded to provide a slightly stronger set of values. Heavy export heifers were good quality and high yielding and they sold to a 3c/kg dearer trend.  The major feature of the sale was the marked improvement in yield potential of cows. Buyers appreciated the better quality and the market gained 6c to 8c/kg. Bull prices remained firm.

Top sale price was 229.2c/kg paid for light heifer vealers to slaughter."
"Quality slipped once again as the winter weather gets colder and the feed value reduces. Weaner steers and vealer heifers made up the biggest percentage of the yarding while there were again good numbers of cows even though the quality was reduced. There were a few more pens of heavy steers and bullocks in the yarding but feeder steers numbers are quickly reducing. Trade cattle continue to be very short supplied.

The trend in the market was firm to cheaper. In the young cattle the best weaners steers and the best lightweight vealer heifers sold at firm rates but feeder steers and the lower quality cattle all lost some value. The demand for the steer weaners from restockers took a slight rise as the district weaner sales are now over and future supply is limited with buyers now starting to recognize that fact.

The heavy steers and bullocks met an improving demand and sold at fully firm to slightly dearer prices. Only the very top yielding cows met a firm market. All other cows were cheaper as some buyers reduce their purchases in the face of increased numbers of plain and light cows. The same situation met the bull market.

The top sale price was 196.2c/kg for quality steer weaner weighing 300kg live weight."
"Quality over-conditioned cattle were in fair numbers coupled with an equal supply of much sought after restocker cattle. Yearlings, particularly heifers, and cows were well supplied and most other descriptions were available in the market.

Firm to dearer was the trend in the market with demand for all descriptions steady at worst and much stronger on some types of young cattle. Light restocker heifers, yearlings and vealers, sold to a dearer trend as did the trade weight yearling heifers. Feeder heifers in fair numbers were fully firm. Restocker light steer vealers and yearling steers sold to a very solid demand at firm prices. Trade steers were not available. A feature of the market for young cattle was the intensity of the demand from restockers for light weight young stock.

Exporters were keen to obtain suitable cattle and the heavy steers and bullocks showed a price rise of 2c to 3c/kg on all weights. Cows met a similar increased enquiry to record a price rise, while export heifers sold at firm rates. Bulls sold to a 2c/kg price increase.

Top sale of the day was 249.2c/kg paid by a restocker for light male vealers."
"Quality on all the younger cattle was the same as last week but the feeder steers and the cows suffered a drop in quality. Trade heifers were in low numbers once again while yearling steers to restockers were in fair supply and the quality was good. The same comment applied to the weaner steers. All the usual buyers attended the sale but demand was much weaker on some types. 

The market for some young cattle and plainer types in particular dropped severely but the better types sold to almost a firm trend. The biggest losses occurred in light heifer vealers and plain and light yearlings. The top of the vealers and weaner and yearling steers stayed at firm prices. There was a considerable drop in the price of plain feeder steers.

Steers under 500kg also suffered a sudden drop in price and that drop was up to 20c but average between 12 and 15c/kg. Bullocks sold well if they were well enough covered for condition. With almost no competition from restockers on plainer steers it is unlikely that the situation will improve without good rain. Only the very best yielding cows stayed firm while the price losses were considerable on the medium to lightweight cows. The bull market was firm.

The top price in the sale was 189.2c/kg paid for steer weaners weighing 270kg and they were bought by restockers."
"Quality on a percentage of the offering was better than the previous week, with a number of pens of heavy steers and light bullocks most of which were fat score three. The cows yarded were in good condition while the younger cattle were very lightweight yearlings, some of which were well out of condition. 

There was another very keen demand from local growers for the lightweight yearlings, both steers and heifers. The steer portion sold at fully firm rates while the heifer portion were dearer by 6c to 8c/kg. There were no trade yearlings or feeder steers in the yarding.

The heavy steers and bullocks in the offering were good quality but most were not finished. They sold steadily to marginally cheaper under limited competition. The cows met a strong demand to sell from fully firm to 2c/kg dearer but the bull price was cheaper. There were no feeder steers offered."
"Quality offered was very mixed and overall not up to the last sale. There were some very good cattle penned alongside a bigger percentage of plain descriptions. All grades were well represented with all regular buyers in attendance.

The very good seasonal conditions have seen local restockers active recently on most grades of young cattle. Competition was strong on light vealers, particularly the heifer portion. They sold to a dearer trend, up 10c to 15c/kg to restockers, while those to the trade saw little change. Vealer steers remained firm. Restockers and feedlots were also active on yearlings. Light yearling steers remained firm and the medium and heavy grades were firm to slightly cheaper. Heifer yearlings, both to the trade and feedlot orders sold firm to 3c/kg cheaper for the better quality cattle. There were some plain lightweights which sold to restockers at slightly improved values.

There were greater numbers of heavy steers offered, most with 4 or more teeth. The market saw a cheaper trend, down 1c to 2c/kg. Grown heifers with 2 or more teeth sold to a slightly dearer trend. The cow market saw a dearer trend, up 2c to 5c/kg. Heavy bulls sold firm to 2c/kg dearer with the light and medium weight bulls selling to a dearer trend."
"Quality improved to a remarkable degree. Yearling heifers, heavy steers and bullocks, and cows were well represented. Restocker and feeder steers and vealers and trade steers were in low numbers only. Yield on export weight cattle was estimated to be 1% higher than the previous week. 

Market values for all young cattle were steady. Restocker demand for young cattle continued to be strong, with the lighter weights attracting most grower attention. Yearling steers were difficult to find in a yarding again dominated by female cattle. There were a few pens of cows and calves in the offering, and they sold at open auction to restockers at a top price of $860/head.

Bullocks and heavy steers met strong demand and values were slightly dearer for the best finished. The heavier export heifers sold strongly to record rises up to 6c/kg. Cows were also in demand and sold at firm to dearer prices. There was a drop in yield in the bulls but values were unchanged.

C2 light restocker calves weighing 110kg topped the sale at 236c/kg."
"Quality improved on last sale,with more cattle offered, and a greater variety in the yarding. The market trend for young cattle for Domestic usage, was fully firm for the tradeweight steers and restock steers,and firm to just a little easier for heifers.Export cattle showed a slightly dearer trend on steers , and good rises for the heavier yeilding and best finished cows.,as the shortage of these type of cattle becomes more acute.Restockers were again active on most types of fattening cattle."
"Quality improved in most categories with heavier heifers, cows and bulls, in a greater percentage than usual. There were 120 cows and calves sold on an open auction basis, which is surprising considering the amount of green pasture available. Weaners and yearlings made up the smallest offering this season, while bullocks were limited to just a few pens of quality cattle.

In a similar situation to sales earlier in the week, there was a very strong enquiry for all descriptions, with demand far exceeding the available supply. The few weaners and yearlings, either sold to restockers or trade, sold at very firm rates, with restockers pushing the price of lightweights up to recent high levels, and wholesale buyers were disappointed with the quality of the trade cattle.

Older feeder steers were firm while the few pens of light bullocks sold at slightly dearer rates. Export heifers over 400kg live weight sold between 10c and 15c/kg dearer under intense bidding. Medium and heavy cows also recorded rises of between 12c and 20c/kg depending on yield potential, while bull prices also saw a significant price rise. 

The top sale price recorded was 249.2c/kg paid by a restocker for very lightweight steer weaners."
"Quality fell away in the last sale before the Christmas recess. Yearlings and cows were in the greatest percentage of the yarding with insufficient heavy steers or bullocks available to provide a quote. The light vealers were in lesser numbers with most of the heifer portion going to slaughter and all the steers being bought by restockers.

There was very keen demand for restocker cattle with the opportunities to buy being restricted at this time. The market for young cattle was therefore very strong indeed and prices were dearer. Trade heifers sold at firm prices while lightweight feeder steers also met a dearer market.

Cows and heavier export heifers sold strongly at firm prices with less competition available due to early abattoir closures. This lack of competition was the cause of a 20c/kg fall in the bull values.

The top sale price was 272.2c/kg paid by a restocker for light heifer vealers."
"Quality did not reach the standard of the previous sale. Cows were in fair numbers and quality was good. Yearling heifers were well supplied while restocker and feeder yearlings were in much lower numbers. Heavy heifers were in fair supply with many carrying excess fat cover.  Bullocks and vealers were in limited numbers.

Demand for all cattle was strong. The usual buyers were in attendance and prices for young cattle varied from firm to dearer. Restocker and feeder yearling steers were fully firm. Yearling heifers to restock or to the trade were considerably dearer. The few pens of light vealers sold at very strong rates but supply was limited. 

Heavy steers and light bullock prices were up to 4c/kg dearer under keen demand. Heavy heifer and bull prices were unchanged. All cows sold between firm and 2c/kg dearer with yield estimates showing a slight increase.

Light C2 vealer heifers estimated to weigh 180kg topped the market at 233.2c/kg."
"Quality continues to improve weekly as the feed quality picks up. Numbers at 585 were the same as last sale, with all but vealers represented. Restocker demand was noticeably stronger, resulting in a price increase.Light trade yearlings met a stronger market, as did the heaviest steers and light bullocks, the latter rise in keeping with recent Northern trends. Cows met good enquiry and remained solid with their quality a little better by way of increased yield."
"Quality and numbers dropped across all categories with the general easing of prices at all the major selling centres, and the good season being experienced over the supply area prompting producers to hold cattle back for further finishing. There were several pens of well-finished heifer vealers available for competition. Most of the yearlings were more suited to restocker and feeder buyers.

Restocker buyers provided solid competition however most rates eased by 10c to 14c/kg on cattle selling to these orders. Feeder cattle were less affected but still showed an easing in value.  Well-finished vealer heifers met a solid demand lifting in value by 3c to 7c/kg. The few yearlings, which did sell to slaughter orders showed little change either way

Grown heifers met good enquiry and sold fully firm to 2c/kg dearer topping at 168c/kg. Steers and bullocks were not in big numbers and most sales eased 8c to 10c, however the best-conditioned lines still managed to reach 172c/kg. Plain cows improved by 3c/kg while the better-conditioned lines eased by a similar amount.

Two light vealer heifers gained the top price of 235c/kg."
"Quality across most categories was much improved with most descriptions well represented except for heavy bullocks. Weaners were well supplied again this week and they are expected to come forward in fair numbers until late in June. The percentage of cows in the market held at last sale numbers while heavier heifers were well supplied. Restocker weaner steers were very good quality for the bulk of the offering.

The usual field of buyers attended the sale and the market trend in young cattle was firm or cheaper. All weaner cattle commenced the sale a little slowly for price but picked up value as the quality improved through the sale. Weaner steers to restock and heifer vealers to slaughter were between 4c and 6c/kg cheaper on average. Restocker demand for quality young cattle was as strong as it has been for most of the season. Feeder heifers and trade heifers sold at unchanged rates.

The few younger bullocks in the market sold at firm prices but the older types were cheaper as has been the case at the last three sales. Export heifers sold at 6c/kg cheaper, but all weigts in cows were very solid and remained unchanged in price. Bull prices did not alter from the last sale."
"Quality across all descriptions was considerably down on the previous week in both condition and breed quality. Yearling steers and heifers were in the greatest numbers in the market followed by very light vealers and cows. There were very few grown steers yarded by restocker yearling and yearling feeder steers were very well supplied but most were very light weights. It is clear that even with the good feed now becoming available growers are selling their young cattle now at the high prices rather than risk a fall in the market at a later date.

With numbers available increasing across the country every day the market for all slaughter young cattle was very considerably cheaper. However the demand for lightweight restocker cattle continues in strength and there were many pens selling at a dearer price as restockers and feeders scramble for numbers.

The major easing in price was reserved for the export type cattle. There were not enough heavy steers or bullocks for a reliable quote but the cow market was much cheaper than last sale. The lightweight cows were cheaper but the drop could have been greater were it not for strong restocker competition. The medium and heavy cows showed the biggest fall with odd pens to 17c/kg easier."
"Prospect of some handy rain reduced numbers slightly. Vealers, yearlings and cows made up the bulk of what was a fair to good quality offering, the condition was fair. The rain brought some extra competition into the market with rain cancelling their regular market.

Vendors were well rewarded this week, the market for most grades of young cattle dearer. Restockers were active on both weaners and yearlings. Weaner steers were dearer by 5c to 15c/kg and more in places. Yearling steers to both restockers and feeders were very strong showing rises of 20c to 30c/kg across all weight ranges. Vealer heifers also met strong competition, the best heifers a little dearer. The secondary quality heifer vealers saw the best of the heifer market, up 9c to 12c/kg. Yearling heifers, both trade and feeders followed a similar trend, with those over 400kg selling 4c/kg dearer. The gap in price between the top quality and the secondary quality cattle closed considerably thanks to the rain.

There were some handy grown steers penned, the market showing a dearer trend, up 6c to 10c/kg with some processors buying lighter weights than normal in an effort to fulfil requirements. The grown heifers followed a similar trend as the yearling heifers. The cow market was also strong, light cows selling 6c to 15c/kg dearer. The medium and heavy weight cows saw the best of a very buoyant market with 3 and 4 scores selling 13c to 20c/kg dearer. Restockers were active in the plainer conditioned cows and competed strongly against processors."
"Part of the increased yarding was caused by the addition of 400 advertised clearance sale cattle. The quality of the regular yarding was very much better than it has been with all descriptions except trade yearlings, well represented. There were some good pens of feeder steers and bullocks, together with a better quality offering of cows. Yearling heifers were in fair numbers and vealers and weaners made an appearance for the first time this season.

There was a very full field of buyers of young cattle including a strong contingent of restockers. The trend in the young cattle market was firm to dearer. Vealers and weaners were dearer by 3c/kg while plain and light heifer yearlings were anything up to 10c/kg dearer, with restocker competition the main reason. Restocker cattle were also dearer under a keen demand.

Bullocks and heavy feeder steers were dearer by 5c/kg with the half that rose occasionally by a higher yield. Cows and export heifers held firm, and again, competition was strong. There was no change in the price of bulls."
"Overall numbers showed an increase of 100 head, with yearlings and cows making up the bulk of the offering. All other categories had representation, with a fair supply of grown steers suitable to lot feed. The quality of the offering was mixed and this did impact some price change. There were very few young cattle suitable to the trade, with demand also down. Restocker and feedlot buyers competed strongly on suitable lines.

Market trends varied through the young cattle, with light yearling steers to restockers selling to a cheaper trend for the most part with quality a factor. There was however a single pen of light weights that set a yard record. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed mostly remained firm, however taking breed quality into account, some sales were slightly dearer. Competition for buyers to looking to secure numbers was strong and there was an extra buyer in the market. Yearling heifers to feed sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c/kg. Odd sales to restockers were a little dearer.

Grown steers to feed were significantly dearer, with quality quite mixed. Again this was a result of the need to secure as many cattle as possible. The quality of the plain condition cows lifted prices on what otherwise was a reasonably firm market trend. The well finished cows sold to a cheaper trend of 1c to 2c/kg."
"Overall numbers remained steady with increased supplies of vealers and heavy steers, while cow numbers were well down. The quality of the offering was fair to good throughout all categories with condition showing quite a variation. The regular buyers were in attendance with demand from all sectors strong.

Restockers were active on steer vealers, showing preference for Angus with the market trend dearer, up 8c to 10c/kg on the light and medium weights with little change on the heavier weights. Vealers to the trade were also dearer with the heifer portion up 3c to 4c. Quality played a part in the yearling steer market with the better quality cattle in all weight classes, along with the plain lightweights selling to a dearer trend. Heifer yearlings generally sold to a firm trend with an odd dearer sale to restockers.

Heavy grown steers and the older manufacturing steers sold firm to slightly dearer, with the higher prices reserved for the milk and 2 tooth lots. For the second week in a row there were a few pens of very heavy steers in the older age bracket. Well finished grown heifers showing good yield potential sold to a dearer trend. Competition for good quality cows to fatten was stronger, resulting in a dearer market trend with breed quality contributing to the higher prices. The better condition cows sold to a firm to dearer trend with the lower numbers impacting on average quality and contributing in improvements in average prices."
"Overall numbers remained steady with heavy yearling steers well represented. A good quality penning of those heavy yearling steers stood out in a mixed quality offering. The condition of the offering reflected the winter conditions. The usual processors, restockers and feedlotters were in attendance.

Market trends varied with demand and quality. Local restockers were active on weaner steers, resulting in a dearer trend by as much as 15c/kg. The heifer portion attracted weaker demand selling to a much cheaper trend. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend with quality a factor. The heavy yearling steers to both restock and feed sold at prices similar to other Northern centres, with no similar steers to compare to from this centre last week. Breed was a factor in determining price levels. Yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend.

The few well finished heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend. The cow market was firm to slightly cheaper with a single restocker order active in the better quality plain condition cows. Heavy bulls were up to 5c/kg cheaper."
"Overall numbers reduced. There was a big increase in vealer numbers, while yearling numbers fell sharply with well finished heavy steers also in short supply. Cow numbers were good although overall the quality of the offering was not as good. All regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market was cheaper through all grades. Heifer vealers suffered the most under the increased supply and a lot less restocker activity. The market was 20c to 30c/kg cheaper. Vealer steers to restockers were not as affected although still cheaper, down 4c to 10c/kg. Yearling steers to restockers were generally 8c to 14c cheaper with an isolated pen of quality steers holding firm. Heifer yearlings to feed sold to a cheaper trend, down 7c to 14c with the few trade heifer yearlings showing 5c to 10c/kg cheaper.

In what was a depressed grown cattle market the few good quality well finished heavy steers saw the best of it. They went relatively unscathed, down 4c to 5c/kg. Grown heifers saw a cheaper market while the cow market saw prices ease, down 8c to 10c/kg. Heavy bulls were down as much as 15c/kg."
"Over half the yarding were yearlings with some very well bred restocker type steers available. Half the yearling heifers were plain and light while the rest were good medium and light trade. There were a few bullocks available but they were of a lower standard and there were not enough for a reliable quotation. Cows were in fair numbers but the average yield potential was low.

The best quality steer yearlings sold strongly to restockers at fully firm prices but the second grade types were considerably cheaper. It was very obvious that restockers wanted to buy quality only and showed much less interest on plain cattle. The trend over all was that the yearling heifers were cheaper following the easier market of last week with 8c to 12c/kg being the average fall. There were no medium vealers yarded but the few light weights were cheaper but not to a great degree.

The cow market was cheaper in its own right but the lack of yield was a factor in the lower prices paid. Heavy and export heifers lost considerable price, as did the bulls yarded.

Top sale price was 227.6c/kg paid for lightweight vealers under 200kg."
"Only about ten per cent of the yarding were fat cattle, and the balance were unfinished cattle of all categories. With such a good summer season, the reason for the plain quality, must be the drop in fertilizer usage, over recent years.

No rain has fallen and the market trend is considerably cheaper. All vealer and yearlings showed the greatest falls, with the heifer portions the most affected. Restock yearlings displayed the same degree of falls.

A few pens of the best heavy cows and export heifers were not much cheaper, but all other export types fell away by up to ten cents per kilogram, with Buyer enthusiasm at a low ebb."
"Once again there was an increase in numbers. Overall the quality of the offering was very mixed with all grades represented. All regular processor orders were in place although there were a couple of regular feedlot orders absent.

The market throughout the young cattle offering was reasonably solid with the majority of the steers and fair percentage of the heifers going to restockers and feeders. Vealer steers sold firm to slightly cheaper to restockers with quality a factor. The heifer vealers followed a similar trend with restocker activity a little more subdued. A small number of the best vealers to the trade sold close to firm. Yearling steers to restock and feed in all categories sold firm to 4c/kg dearer with an odd sale of heavy feeders showing a greater rise in line with improved quality. The softer feedlot competition had little effect on the market with restockers picking up the slack. Heifer yearlings sold to a slightly cheaper trend overall, although towards the back of the sale they did firm up.

Heavy steers sold at rates similar to last sale with quality the cause of any negative price fluctuations. Grown heifers also sold to a firm trend. 

All but a small number of cows to restockers sold 1c to 4c/kg cheaper. Heavy bulls were also cheaper."
"Once again there was a small number penned. The quality of the offering was very mixed. There were a number of pens of good quality heifer yearlings suitable to restock and feed. All the regular processor orders were in place.

There were insufficient vealer steers to quote. The small number of heifer vealers sold to a dearer trend, up 7c/kg due mostly to some strong restocker demand. The quality of the yearling steers was well down, with this a contributing factor in the drop in prices. Lightweight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, up 4c/kg, with an improvement in average quality accounting for the greater price change.

Heavy grown steers and the manufacturing bullocks sold to a dearer trend, the grown steers up 1c with the bullocks, much improved for quality, 10c/kg dearer. Grown heifers also sold to a dearer trend, up 8c to 18c/kg. The cow market showed varying trends, with the 2 score cows slightly cheaper and the 3 and 4 score cows 5c to 12c/kg dearer, quality contributing."
"Once again there was a small increase in numbers. All grades were represented with quality and finish throughout was fair to good. All regular orders were in place for what was a strong market. 

There was a fair supply of vealers with the majority of the steers purchased by restockers at dearer rates. The trend was up 20c to 25c/kg and more in places. Heifer vealers met both restocker and processor demand to be up to 15c dearer, while a small number of 3 score butcher heifers were 3c/kg dearer. Light weight yearling steers to restock sold dearer, up 4c/kg. The medium weight steers to restock lacked the overall quality of the previous sale to sell cheaper. Quality was also down with the well finished heavy trade steers, the market however remained firm. There was a good quality offering of well finished heifer yearlings in the medium and heavy weight ranges. They attracted strong demand from feeders and restockers with the market showing significant improvement, the trend 13c to 20c/kg. Heavy trade heifers saw little change.

There were some very good quality heavy steers on offer, particularly milk and 2 tooths, the market dearer, up to 10c/kg. Grown heifers also sold to a dearer trend. The cow market showed some variation. There was increased restocker competition for the plainer condition cows with the market up to 9c/kg dearer. The medium weight cows to processors also sold dearer, up 4c/kg. Heavy cows sold firm with an odd sale of high yielding cows 2c/kg dearer, while there were also some quality related price changes."
"Once again the numbers were reduced and yearling steer composed almost half of the yarding with the quality quite good. There were also some well finished crop fattened yearling heifers penned. Grown cattle numbers were well down with only a few heavy steers to speak of and less than 70 cows in the offering. Not all buyers were present.

Restocker orders were prevalent once again, purchasing most of the yearling steers. Defying the current wintery conditions on the tablelands the market was dearer. Light weight steers were firm to 7c dearer with the medium weights up to 10c/kg dearer. Some very good local competition as well as form the slopes and plains. Yearling heifers lacked the feedlot competition of last week, most going to processors and the market firm to 4c/kg cheaper. There were isolated sales of the very best heifers that sold at rates 2c to 3c/kg dearer.

There were insufficient heavy steers to gauge a market trend. Restockers were also active on the steers showing less condition. Grown heifers saw a cheaper trend. The limited cow supply also met keen demand resulting in a market  1c to 5c/kg dearer."
"Once again numbers fell with 30 to 50mm of rain over the district. The quality and condition of the offering was fair to good, although well finished young cattle were limited in numbers. There were over 400 cows in the offering, while vealer numbers are on the decline. All buyers were in attendance as well as an extra kill order on plainer conditioned grown steers and heifers.

Not surprisingly after good rainfall the market saw a dearer trend through all grades. Restocker confidence lifted to see vealers steers sell 4c to 17c/kg dearer. Heifer vealers to processors and butchers saw good rises, selling up to 20c/kg dearer. Restockers were also active on vealer heifers, the market 4c to 7c/kg dearer. Yearling steers, most of which went to restockers and feeders were 7c to 10c/kg dearer. Heifer yearlings purchased by the trade sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 7c, while those to restockers and feeders were firm to 3c/kg dearer.

There were only a few heavy grown steers in the offering, they were 5c/kg dearer. Grown heifers were dearer due to the extra competition. The cow market was strong despite the numbers with all grades showing a dearer trend of 6c to 11c/kg."
"Once again it was a small offering of mostly yearling cattle. The majority of yearlings were plain condition lightweights with a small number of crop finished heifers. There were a few handy heavyweight steers and only 20 cows in total. Not all regular buyers were in attendance.

With spring just around the corner local restockers showed plenty of confidence in the future. Plain, lightweight yearling steers sold to a dearer trend. The medium and heavyweight yearling steers to restockers and feed sold to a slightly cheaper trend with quality only average. The very lightweight yearling heifers to restockers followed a similar trend to the steer portion and sold at dearer rates. A small number of well finished heifer yearlings sold to the trade at cheaper rates.

Heavy steers sold to a dearer trend, up 3c to 5Â¢/kg with the very heavyweight steers to slaughter following a similar trend. There were insufficient cows for market quote. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"On a bitterly cold day the yarding was bigger but the quality was plain. Most of the offering were yearlings or older heifers, together with a few lines of average cows and 75 cows and calves which sold to local growers at prices up to $715/head. There were also a few very good quality lines of restocker steers in medium condition.

Cheaper was the market trend for most of the cattle yarded. An exception was seen in the quality yearling steers which were bought by local restockers at firm rates.The plain quality and ligthtweight yearling heifers were 15c/kg cheaper with most going to restockers or to feedlots. There were no vealers yarded.

The few lots of older manufacturing bullocks sold at firm rates while older heifers, mainly four and six tooth and in plainer condition were cheaper in a range of 15c to 30c/kg. Cows were easier by 6c/kg and the few bulls were firm in price."
"Numbers yarded was again steady but quality was lacking over most of the penning. Plain bred feeder steers of all ages were the bulk of the offering but there were a number of pens of good bullocks as well as some excellent pens of high yielding cows. Lightweight restocker steers which have been well supplied in previous weeks were down on quantity as were quality trade weight yearlings.

A full buying field resulted in a very steady market trend in all young stock. Feeder steers met keen enquiry and isolated pens of heavier steers were marginally dearer. However the overall average price was unaffected. The lack of trade cattle in the recent sales has become a trend which is showing little sign of any change for the better.

Heavy steers and bullocks sold well but at slightly lower rates. The majority of the bullocks yarded ranged up to six tooth, but the estimated yield was good. Cows and export heifers sold at fully firm rates as did all the bulls."
"Numbers yarded are starting to get back to normal after an unprecedented wet weather period at Armidale. Some local growers have recorded 300ml in the last 6 weeks. There were some much better quality cattle yarded particularly in the yearling cattle and the bullocks but the restocker steers were not quite up to last week for breed quality. There was a slight improvement in the average yield in the cows while the bull numbers and quality  was constant.

One extra buyer of export cattle attended otherwise the buying power remained unchanged. The overall market trend varied between firm and easier with the heavier export heifers the exception in selling to a slightly dearer rate.

The light vealer and very light heifer yearling market which has been so strong for so long finally displayed an easier trend with sales up to 15c/kg recorded. It is noted that a similar trend this week has been recorded in auctions across the top of the state. Trade cattle were also cheaper while the restocker steer yearlings moved back slightly from the extremes of recent weeks.

The bullock market moved back marginally and that slight fall is the first sign of an easing seen for a number of weeks. The same trend was noted in the cow market with odd pens of quality cattle staying at firm rates but generally the trend was easier but not enough to cause growers concern."
"Numbers were well maintained but the average quality was lower. There was a good supply of very plain and lightweight, drought affected yearlings available, and all were bought by restockers. Trade yearling heifers, heavy steers and light bullocks, and cows were well supplied. Overfat cows were available in greater numbers than usual. Feeder steers were available in smaller numbers only.

All restocker yearlings met very keen demand with prices increasing as growers become used to higher values. Trade cattle sold at fully firm rates, while stronger demand increased values on yearling feeder heifers. Restocker yearlings were mainly extremely light weights but grower demand intensified because of the lack of weight.

Heavy steers and bullock values were well maintained, but a few pens of off type cattle were marginally cheaper. The best heavy and overfat cows sold at firm prices, but some medium quality cows were slightly easier. The bull price and heavy export heifer price, were unaltered.

Extremely lightweight E muscle steer yearlings topped the sale price at 257.2c/kg. A restocker bought the steers, which weighed 150kg."
"Numbers were well maintained but quality suffered. Prime cattle stood out in a much plainer quality yarding with the recent cold weather having the affect of taking any bloom off the majority of the yarding. Heifer weaners ands yearlings made up at least half the yarding while steer yearlings were also well represented. Bullocks and heavy steers were down in yield and there were only small numbers of cows available.

The usual regular orders were represented and the market trend was firm or cheaper. Best finished amongst the young cattle sold at fully firm rates, but plainer types were cheaper in a range of 6c to 10c/kg even though the lack of quality had some bearing on the lower prices obtained. Restocker demand weakened slightly with the recent cold weather not conducive to localised restocking. Most trade orders were unsatisfied due to a lack of supply.

Heavy steers and bullocks were not up to the recent standard set, but values remained unaltered. Heavy export heifers were firm as were the few cows and the quality bulls yarded.

Top price of the day was 218.6c/kg paid by a restocker for light steer weaners."
"Numbers were well down, although similar to recent sales of the previous weeks.  Yearlings were well supplied, while there was only an odd vealer and there was a fair penning of grown heifers and cows.  Quality was much improved with increased numbers of well finished cattle through the sale.

Competition was strong, although some prices were slightly easier. Vealers sold unchanged, while most of the yearling steers and heifers went to restockers and feeders with the better quality cattle attracting the most interest and trade yearlings saw little change.

The yarding of grown heifers and cows consisted of several pens of well finished cattle.  A large percentage of heifers went to feeders while the cow market was firm to slightly easier."
"Numbers were well down although, surprisingly for the time of year, there was an increased percentage of well finished cattle available. All regular processors were in attendance along with the usual restocker and feedlot orders. The market for young cattle was quite good while the value of the $A could be having some effect on the grown cattle with values easing in most cases.

Vealer steers to the trade sold to a dearer trend with an improvement in quality while those to restockers remained firm. Heifer vealers to the trade sold firm to 2c/kg cheaper with competition between buyers not as strong. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold firm to dearer, 6c/kg on the light weights with only a handful going to slaughter. There were some very good quality well finished heifer yearlings available with these grades selling to a dearer trend to the trade and feedlots. The plainer condition cattle sold to a cheaper trend.

The penning of grown steers consisted mostly of 4 and 6 tooth cattle with some full mouth manufacturing steers also offered. The market trend was firm to cheaper taking the age into account. There was an improved quality offering of grown heifers penned, the market for the best of them was dearer while plain quality and condition heifers sold at cheaper rates. 

The cow market eased across all grades with plain condition cows 4c/kg cheaper while the better condition 3 and 4 score cows were 1c to 2c/kg cheaper."
"Numbers were well below the expectation with some growers preferring to wait until later sales. The bulk of the yarding were lightweight yearlings and vealers, most of which were suitable for restockers. Export cattle numbers were well down on past sales. The yarding size was restricted to well below the average numbers with some growers waiting until later sales to ascertain values. Quality was plain with very limited numbers of over-conditioned cattle available. The bulk of the yarding were lightweight yearlings and vealers suitable for restockers. Export weight cattle were also poorly supplied.

Demand for all classes of young cattle and feeder yearlings were stronger than the previous sale prior to Christmas and values for all descriptions varied between fully firm and 5c/kg dearer. There was a particularly keen enquiry for yearling steers in the 330 to 400kg lwt bracket and some of those sales were up to 8c/kg dearer.

Demand for export cattle was much weaker than the last sale due to the non attendance of some export orders. Cows, heavy heifers and bulls were cheaper by up to 10c/kg."
"Numbers were very low to start proceedings for the new year. Expected to increase with sales gazetted to become weekly going forward. All categories were represented with small numbers in each class. There was restricted processor and feedlot attendance, however retocker demand was high. The quality of the offering was on the plainer side.

The quality variation was particularly noticeable through the young cattle with this impacting price change through the young cattle. Taking the plainer quality into account, high restocker demand resulted in market trends improving on yearling steers in comparison to the pre Christmas sale. That was also the case through the yearling heifers.

Heavy grown steers to process saw a firm to slightly dearer trend. Well finished grown heifers to processors sold to cheaper trends under restricted processor competition. A drop in quality and reduced processor competition resulted in cheaper trends through the cow market. There was not a lot of change in the market for the better quality bulls to process.

Market reporter, James Armitage."
"Numbers were up with a good supply of yearlings and an increased yarding of grown steers along with a good penning of cows, while vealer numbers were down.  There were several pens of well-bred vealer and yearling steers that met strong demand from restockers and feeders.

Quality of the young cattle was mixed with some well-finished 3 score cattle and a fair number of 2 scores suitable for the restockers and feeder buyers.  Vealer heifers sold to a cheaper trend to be up to 20c, while trade yearling heifers were 4c to 6c/kg dearer.   
 
The yarding of export cattle consisted of increased numbers of good quality grown steers however, buyers were not as keen resulting in prices falling by up to 7c/kg in places, while some high yielding heifers sold to a dearer trend.  

The larger yarding of cows consisted of increased numbers of heavy over conditioned drafts along with several pens of high yielding types.  The market could not maintain last weeks higher rates resulting in most sales 8c to 10c/kg cheaper.  A highlight of the sale was the dispersal of a well renowned local Devon herd, which attracted keen interest from graziers.

Restocker weaner steers toped the sale at 222.2c/kg."
"Numbers were the same in a yarding where the quality of all the young cattle was well below last week yet the average quality amongst the Export steers, bullocks and cows, remained the same. The demand for all but Restock yearlings was very much weaker. Significant falls in value were  recorded on all slaughter stock with  Export types, cows, steers and bullocks receiving much less attention from Operators. Even though 2 score yearling steers were the cattle least affected by the price falls, the demand was still weaker than last sale. It appears with that the increases in numbers offerred both in Southern QLD and Northern and Western N.S.W, the trade is not strong enough to handle such sudden numbers."
"Numbers were the same as last sale but there was quite a marked improvement in quality throughout, with a fair representation of all but vealers.  The market reacted to the better quality,with all descriptions showing solid rises.  Restocker attention was directed towards yearling steers and light heifers, again forcing significant price rises on those types with Restockers competing with Wholesalers.  Export cattle were again keenly sought after resulting in further price rises."
"Numbers were surprisingly reduced even after a couple of light frosts in the area, a situation normally guaranteed to increase yarding size in the autumn. There was quite a considerable fall in both the fat and breed quality of the offering which comprised big percentages of steer weaners and restocker yearling steers.

Cows were in fair numbers while bullocks and heavy steers were few. Trade heifers and vealer heifer numbers also dropped well below last sale numbers. All the regular buyers attended the sale.  Restocker demand was again very strong with the better bred cattle in steer weaners and in yearling steers remaining fully firm.  Vealer heifers and yearling heifers were marginally weaker while the plainer quality in young cattle showed a 3 c/kg fall.

Demand was much weaker for heavy steers and the few light bullocks with falls up to 5 c/kg recorded. Bulls were poor quality but still showed a sharp price reduction.

There were some high yield cows yarded but most were older medium cows. Their price however remained unaltered."
"Numbers were steady with quality and condition of the yarding very mixed. Young cattle and cows were well supplied and there was a fair supply of grown steers and bullocks. Most of the young cattle sold to restockers and the light trade while heavy trade cattle were in low numbers. Lot feeders competed on suitable lines for their requirements.

Restocker interest was strong and light steer yearlings sold to restocker and feeder buyers at much stronger levels, while the steer weaners sold 3c/kg cheaper. Medium weight trade steers lost 6c/kg while the few heavy weights sold dearer. Light trade heifers gained 3c while medium weights lost 6c and the few heavy trade heifers sold 5c/kg stronger.

There were several pens of heavy steers and bullocks and they sold firm to 3c/kg dearer. There was a good supply of cows and condition was mixed. They sold to the usual trade and restocker buyers to be 1c to 8c/kg dearer."
"Numbers were steady with light weight young cattle making up the bulk of the offering. There were some better bred lines of light weight yearling attractive to restockers. There were a limited number of cows and a larger percentage of bulls compared to the previous sale, however there were too few grown steers and heifers to frame a reliable quote. There was restricted processor attendance; however restocker presence was stronger with spring just around the corner.

There were a couple of processors operating on heifer vealers, with the market trend generally firm. Demand for light weight yearling steers from restockers was very strong, with the better quality light weights up to 5c/kg dearer. The trend for the steers with less weight and muscle was also dearer, with price increases even greater. Medium weight steers also saw a dearer trend, with odd sales up to 13c/kg dearer. The good quality lean heifer yearlings were firm to slightly dearer, while those with a bit more coverage suffered from a lack of competition to show a cheaper trend.

The limited competition from processors, combined with the quality of the cows on offer, resulted in a cheaper market trend through all classes."
"Numbers were stable in the last sale before the Christmas break. Quality by way of both condition and breed quality were similar to last sale with fat cattle well in the minority. Heifer yearlings and cows made up the biggest numbers followed by restocker yearling steers and there were a few pens of heavy steers and bullocks. Splitter vealers under 200kg were in their usual numbers. There were a few very heavy yielding cows in the market and there were also some excellent cows and calves that sold to restockers up to $975/head.

All the young fat cattle in the sale sold at very solid and unaltered prices under a very strong demand. The demand for store cattle was outstanding following further overnight rain in the area with growers obviously prepared to compete against the wholesalers for suitable cattle. The numbers of restocker cattle available was well short of the available demand.

Heavy heifers sold at dearer rates to exporters while the few bullocks available were better yielding, but still sold at slightly increased rates. Cows were very solid in price with no obvious price change under sustained bidding. Bulls sold well, but were not the weight or quality of the last sale."
"Numbers were stable but quality was better with vealers in much greater numbers and yearlings and feeder steers making up the most of the yarding. There were a few pens of bullocks that were not top quality or yield. Cows were very short in numbers, which is surprising for this time of year. Feeder heifers were of better quality while there were a number of steers over 500kg that were bought by feedlots.

There was a very strong market for all young cattle with prices at the highest point recorded. The market for light splitter vealers and medium heifer vealers showed considerable improvement under very much sustained demand. Trade yearling steers and heifers sold to the best ever rates while restocker steer weaners showed price rises between 15c and 20c/kg with the supply unable to match the extremes of the demand. All feeder steers also displayed unprecedented demand with price rises to match that demand.

There was an improvement in price for all heavy steers and bullocks and while there were some excellent heavy steers available the bullocks were disappointing for yield and finish. The best and the lightest of the cows sold to a dearer trend but the middle weights and medium conditioned cows did not alter for price.

The top price recorded in the sale was 240c/kg for lightweight steers weaners bought to restock."
"Numbers were slightly increased at Armidale today, but the quality remained about the same level as the previous sale. The only exception came in the yearling steers to restock which were better breed quality than the previous week. The bullocks and heavy steers were again not up to the top of the quality and the cows were mostly similar types to last sale. The usual regular buyers attended the sale and the majority trend in the market was fully firm.

Very light vealers under 200kg continue to sell strongly with prices just above the last sale. All other vealers and yearling cattle sold right up to the previous weeks price levels with restocker cattle and the feeder steers and heifers again meeting a very solid demand. The demand for grass eaters from growers shows no sign of a weakening as the bulk of growers are having serious trouble finding cattle they want at any reasonable price.

The bullock sale was again very steady with demand outstripping supply once again. Numbers in the North this week have been well below the levels of earlier weeks. The cow market returned to earlier price levels with keen demand a keynote of the sale. The number of quality cows continues to be fairly restricted."
"Numbers were similar but there was an increase in quality with more and better types of feeder steers and heifers, young bullocks and weaners steers yarded.  Trade cattle and quality cows to slaughter continued to be in very short supply.  Any cattle sent to abattoirs were either off oat crops or had been supplementary fed.  The balance of the cattle off pasture has held condition well considering the extremely cold weather experienced recently. 

Young cattle were again in strong demand with the market trend for them being either fully firm or dearer.  Domestic feeder cattle steers or heifers were 10c/kg dearer under sustained competition.  Trade heifers were steady while the restocker portion of the yearling heifers was considerably stronger in price. There were no yearling trade steers yarded but the restocker yearling steers were 10c/kg dearer.
	
Young bullocks were dearer by anything up to 10c/kg but they were a high yield potential which had considerable bearing on the price rise.  There were only limited numbers of export heifers and cows yarded but the very best of each were a few cents per kilogram dearer.  Export weight feeder steers were dearer by up to 10c/kg with the sale numbers restricted for the heavy weights."
"Numbers were restricted for the first sale since 18th December. Quality was good with almost every description represented. Yearlings again made up the bulk of the offering, while export heifers and cows were supplied in fair numbers.

Demand for all cattle was strong with restockers and meatworks competing keenly, and frequently against each other for the same cattle. Shortage of numbers in southern Queensland this week, appeared to have a marked affect on prices as abattoirs struggled to obtain market share. Light young cattle sold strongly to a dearer trend with light vealers selling up to 20c/kg dearer to both meatworks and restockers.

Feeder steers over 400kg met very strong demand as has been the case in northern markets this week, with prices increasing by up to 7c/kg on most lots. There were only very few bullocks available and demand was very keen. Cows met good competition but the values were still well below the December market price. A pen of quality young Angus/Hereford cows and calves sold to a restocker at $940/head.

Top price of the sale was 237.2c/kg paid for light restocker steer vealers estimated to weigh 180kg."
"Numbers were reduced with young cattle well supplied. Cows made up the bulk of the grown cattle. The overall quality and condition of the offering was very mixed. The regular processors were in attendance along with extra restocker and feedlot competition. Demand was high from all sectors resulting in a dearer market throughout.

The quality of the vealer steers was very mixed with some very plain condition lightweights penned. The market trend for the better quality steers to restock was firm to 5c/kg dearer. Vealer heifers were in demand with the market for all but the heavier 3 scores 3c to 5c/kg dearer. There was an increased supply of yearling steers in all weight classes. Competition was strong with trends dearer. Light and medium weights were 14c to 18c/kg dearer and more in places with quality also contributing to the price improvement. Yearling heifers to the trade were 8c to 11c/kg dearer with some of the increase quality related.

Demand for export cattle was strong with heavy grown steers selling to a dearer trend, quality and age also a factor. The cow market was 3c to 5c/kg dearer."
"Numbers were reduced slightly with good finished cattle in demand.  All the regular buyers were present and active with constant restocker competition throughout the sale. Quality was varied and not generally up to the standard of last sale. There was some good young cattle, however most of the older lines were showing the signs of the season. 

Young cattle dominated the offering with restockers purchasing a fair percentage. Vealer steers to slaughter made to 180c as restocker paid to 195.2c for lightweights. Medium weights to restockers averaged mostly from 186c to 191c/kg. Good medium weight vealer heifers to slaughter averaged 151.1c with those to restockers reaching 175.6c/kg. C3 medium weight yearling steers to slaughter sold to 174.2c and heavy weights to 174.4c/kg.  Medium weights to restockers averaged 155.3c/kg. 

Older steers met solid demand with medium weights selling to 168c/kg. Heavier weights made to 155.2c/kg. Light lean cows to slaughter averaged just under 95c with the plainer types to restockers averaging 80c/kg. Medium weight D3s sold to 118.6c with a single C3 topping at 147c/kg. 

Feeders were also active on the steers paying to 178.8c/kg.  

The top price for the sale was 199.8c/kg for medium weight vealer steers."
"Numbers were reduced by a third. Young cattle were well supplied along with a good penning of cows. The quality offered was mixed with some good quality lines alongside secondary cattle throughout all categories. Most of the regular processors were in attendance. 

It was a variable market for young cattle with steer vealers to restock averaging slightly cheaper, breed and quality were factors. Heifer vealers to the trade were dearer, up 1c/kg. Lightweight yearling steers to restock and feed sold firm to dearer with the plainer quality lots up 5c/kg. Medium weight yearling steers were up to 14c dearer to average 11c/kg higher, while the heavy steers to restock remained firm. The better quality light and medium weight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend with extra competition. The plainer quality D muscle heifers were cheaper. Well finished heifers to the trade also sold to a cheaper trend.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend, up to 5c/kg. Grown heifers saw little but quality related changes. The cow market was cheaper for the plainer condition cows to both process and restock, down 2c to 7c/kg. The better condition medium and heavy cows saw little but quality related price changes on a firm market trend."
"Numbers were reduced by 25%, the most likely cause a reluctance to sell on the current falling market. Cows and vealers made up the bulk of what was a fairly plain conditioned offering. Not all regular buyers were in attendance with 1 processor and 1 commission buyer absent. A new commission buyer entered the market however this had little effect on the market trend.

A cheaper market throughout. The least affected cattle were the better quality steer vealers on the heavier end of the weights, they were still cheaper however, down 5c to 6c/kg. There were more cattle at the top end resulting in a dearer average. The heifer vealers were also cheaper, down 11c to 23c/kg. No yearling steers went to the trade, all being purchased by feeders or restockers, they were cheaper, down 8c to 20c/kg. Yearling heifers C muscle both to the trade and to restocker and feeder interests were subject to similar falls, while the lightly muscled heifer yearlings saw price falls of up to 30c/kg.

There were insufficient grown steers to quote a market trend. The cow market continued its downward trend. Light cows attracted some restocker interest, prices 3c to 6c/kg cheaper. The medium weight grades down 5c to 12c, while the heavy cows saw the greatest falls, down 19c/kg."
"Numbers were reduced and there was a good penning of vealers.  Yearlings were well supplied especially heifers, a few pens of grown steers and cows were in fair numbers.  Quality was fairly good with some good runs of well bred vealers and yearlings that were keenly sought after by feeder and restocker buyers.

Competition was strong on the restocker vealer steers with values holding firm. Vealer heifers to the trade were down by 5c/kg however, restockers and feeders acquired some of the better bred heifers.  Most of the yearling steers went to feeders and restockers with the lighter steers selling 4c to 6c/kg dearer while the heavy feeder steers lost some ground. Trade yearling heifers were 5c cheaper however, feeders were up by 5c/kg.

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of cows with a few lines of steers and heifers. The yarding of cows was mixed. The grown cattle market varied with grown steers holding firm and heifers slightly easier. Heavy and light cows were slightly easier, while medium weights sold firm to slightly dearer."
"Numbers were nearly halved as producers hold cattle off the market while prices are on the decline.  Yearling numbers were the most affected and there was only an odd steer, while cows made up the biggest percentage of the yarding.

Quality was fairly mixed with mainly plainer type young cattle through the sale.  There were insufficient vealers for a quote.  The penning of yearling steers were acquired by restockers or feeders.  Yearling heifers were in only fair numbers and the most affected in the market drop.

Cows dominated the yarding of export cattle with insufficient numbers of steers or heifers for a reliable quote.  The yarding of cows consisted mainly of plainer grades although there were several pens of higher yielding cows in the sale.  Competition was strong amongst buyers although prices were below last weeks rates.  The bull market was strong with several heavy good yielding bulls.

The top price of the sale was for light weight veal at 211.2c/kg."
"Numbers were more than double the previous sale as the hotter and dry weather reduced the quality of available feed. Over 85% of the yarding was yearlings and light vealers with lotfeeder and restockers purchasing the bulk of that offering. There were very few trade cattle yarded but there was a number of pens of younger bullocks while cows were reasonably well supplied. Over 130 head of restocker cows and calves were sold by open auction at prices up to $1,155.

The onset of the hot, dry weather was the cause of a drop in price of 4c/kg on most young cattle with only the absolutely best quality lots retaining last sale rates. Feeder and restocker demand was still strong but the change in the weather caused some growers to reassess their feed situation. There were a few pens of high yielding splitter calves yarded and they met another keen enquiry. 

The bullocks sold at slightly cheaper rates while cows and export heifers met solid demand to record fully firm prices. Bulls were unchanged in value."
"Numbers were marginally increased but the offering was still below the usual for this time of the year. It was a very plain conditioned yarding with the winter weather having stripped plenty of condition from most of the young stock. Yearlings and weaners were the major percentage with just a few cows and bulls to make up the balance of the yarding.

There was another very keen demand from local growers for all young cattle and values once again lifted with the demand mainly centred around the lightest weight cattle. Up to 20c dearer was paid for some lots although the average price rise was closer to 10c/kg. The few light yearling heifer pens sold to wholesalers at dearer rates but there were no trade weight cattle yarded. 

The few pens of cows and export heifers were in limited numbers but sold at steady to slightly stronger values, while the limited numbers of bulls were also dearer."
"Numbers were maintained at similar levels to the past week with some very well bred and fattened cattle available but there was also the usual percentage of plainer types particularly in weaners. Weaners were in big numbers as the time for weaning is now in full swing with very big numbers being offered on the Tablelands at present. Yearling trade cattle were again light supplied while heavy steers and bullocks were in bigger numbers but quality was only average. Cows were well supplied and there was a genuine mixture in the larger yarding with some very heavy cows yarded and down to some very light conditioned cows.

There were some very good weaner steers yarded and they sold right up to previous levels but there was a very big drop in interest in the light and plain steer weaners and in the heifer weaners all of which showed a very considerable cheapening. The better finished heifer weaners sold at close to firm prices in most cases. Best feeder steers were firm but any that were below the very best also met a quieter demand to register some price losses. Trade heifers sold at firm rates and all the yearling steers went to feeders or restockers.

Any bullocks or heavy steers that were either well fattened or young sold at firm prices but prices fell away on the plainer types with feedlotters and restockers showing little interest in these cattle. The cow prices remained at last sale levels with only a few pens of very plain and old cows showing any weakening. Restockers again helped some of the light or joined cows to remain firm.

The top price in the sale was for a pen of restocker steer weaners weighing over 250kg which sold at 211.6c/kg."
"Numbers were lower at Armidale today with the approach of the holiday break with quite a few people on holiday following the end of the school term. Quality of the cattle was fair only and the bulk of the yarding was yearlings and cows with a number of pens of grown steers. Most of the older steers needed more finish, but they went back to fatteners anyway.

There were a number of pens of well bred yearling off steers going either to fatteners or to lot feeders. Restockers also took advantage of the numbers of very light yearling heifers that were available. The usual buyers attended and the market except for a cheaper trend on bulls was either firm or dearer.

Yearling cattle to slaughter sold right up with last sale prices, while there was an improved rate available for feeder or restocker yearlings and grown steers. The strong demand from local growers continues following a little more rain during the week.

Heavy steers and the few bullocks were unchanged in value, but the cows were battling to reach last sale rates and in fact, odd pens were seen to be a cent or two cheaper while the averages did not alter a lot. There has been a steady decline in bull market prices, to the stage where the averages over the last 3 weeks are between 15c and 20c/kg lower following a long period of exceptional prices being received."
"Numbers were lighter this week as the winter draws to a close and the yardings slow down until January. Quality was very much the same as last week with light steers and heifer weaners and restocker steer yearlings making up the bulk of the yarding. Heavy steers and bullocks were in reasonable numbers but once again the cow numbers were very light. Bulls were only average quality and yield.

The bulk of the young cattle in the offering sold at very firm prices when compared to last sale. The increases in price were clearly seen in restocker steer yearlings and weaners, all of which met the keenest demand for the season, and recorded price rises of up to 8c/kg, but the average rise was less than that.

There was another fully firm market in all export cattle with demand very strong once again. There was strong demand for feeder cattle but the supply was very light. Prices for the heavier feeder steers were marginally dearer with the increases driven by quality rises only. 

Top price in the sale was 237.2c/kg paid for very light heifer vealers to slaughter."
"Numbers were light for the first sale in the New Year although it was estimated that a few more cattle were yarded as against the numbers drawn for. There were some handy quality yearlings and light vealers in the yarding together with some good style and high yielding cows.

The usual buyers attended the sale but it was very obvious that some were watching the market carefully in anticipation of the hot drying weather forcing cattle onto the market in the next few weeks. With the exception of the very lightweight vealers and the best trade cattle which held firm the balance of the yarding showed considerable price falls with restocker and plain yearlings selling very much cheaper. Some buyers indicated that the dry weather coupled with the proximity to the Christmas and New year break has led to very much less beef being consumed thus reducing liveweight prices.

There were no bullocks available but there were a few heavy steers yarded and they sold up to 10c/kg cheaper. The biggest price falls were reserved for the cows and bulls with a considerable drop registered with some cows losing up towards 30c in price and bulls showing a 20c/kg loss.

The top sale price registered was 281.2c/kg paid for lightweight vealers under 200kg."
"Numbers were greater than the previous two sales with the increase being covered by bigger lines of restocker cattle. Quality was slightly improved with increased supplies of cows, weaner and yearling restocker cattle. The only bullocks yarded were three score fat cover while feeder steers were improved quality.

The buying field included more local growers all looking to buy lightweight cattle with the prospect of spring pasture beginning to become a reality. Weaners and yearlings were almost all bought by local growers at fully firm rates. A few pens of trade cattle were also very steady in price.

The values in export cattle were very solid and the demand for these cattle was greater than the supply. There were a few older steers yarded and they were snapped up by local restockers and feedlots. Bull numbers were greater and values remained unaltered."
"Numbers were down slightly with young cattle and cows making up the bulk of the offering. The majority of the young cattle fell into the light and medium weight classes with feed stocks remaining low. The poor seasonal conditions were reflected in the quality and condition of the young cattle, with quality very mixed and condition generally lean. Conversely there were some very well finished cows. Processor attendance was limited, while the usual feeder and restocker orders were in place. Overall the market trends showed quite a variation, somewhat erratic in places.

The better quality light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed saw a firm to slightly dearer trend, while there was a great deal of variation in prices for the secondary quality cattle, with a lot of the variation dependent on the preferences of restockers. There was limited competition on heavier yearling steers from restockers. Yearling heifers probably saw the most variation in the market with some of the lightweight grades selling as much as 20c/kg cheaper, while an odd sale to processors showed a dearer trend. There was a vast difference in prices within weight classes, with breed quality also a contributing factor.

The few heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend. The best of the heavy cows sold close to firm with an odd sale slightly dearer. The plainer conditioned cows averaged cheaper with some sales firm, depending on the level of competition."
"Numbers were down slightly for a yarding of 710 head. Vealers and yearlings were well supplied, and there was a fair penning of cows. Quality was mixed in a market that was easier for most classes of cattle. There were only a few lines that went to slaughter, with the majority going to restockers. 

Restocker vealer steers sold close to firm from 144c to 222c/kg. Restocker vealer heifers sold from 114c and 158c/kg. The few trade yearling steers sold from 159c and 190c/kg. Restocker and feeder steers made from 127c and 183c, while yearling heifers to the trade sold from 153c and 175c/kg. Restocker and feeder heifers made from 118c and 159c/kg. 

The odd grown steer topped at 163c and heifers at 149c/kg. There was limited competition on cows with most selling from 107c and 118.2c/kg."
"Numbers were down only slightly with vealers and yearlings well supplied, while cows dominated the grown cattle. The yarding of young cattle consisted of some good runs of well-bred steers and heifers that were keenly sought after by both feeder and restocker buyers. Vealer steers and heifers were mainly medium weights, along with several pens of heavy steers.

Competition was strong with restocker vealer steers sold firm to dearer as good falls of rain covered most of the Northern Tablelands. Vealer heifers to slaughter were slightly dearer however restockers acquired a large percentage of the better bred heifers at strong prices. Feeder and restocker yearling steers were firm to 6c dearer, while trade yearling heifers sold firm to 2c/kg dearer.  

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows, although not the numbers of previous weeks and there was a small penning of grown steers and heifers. Grown steers and heifers were slightly dearer, while the cow market improved by 3c to 5c/kg."
"Numbers were down for a yarding of 1,235 head.  The yarding consisted of a good supply of vealers and yearlings, while cows dominated the grown cattle.  Quality of the yarding of young cattle was mixed with some good runs of well-bred weaners and yearlings that were suitable for restockers, backgrounders and feeders. 

The market varied through the sale with restocker vealer steers selling 4c to 5c dearer selling to a top of 342c, while vealer heifers to slaughter were down by 7c toping at 281c and restocker heifers sold to 287c/kg.  Feeder and restocker feeder steers were firm to 10c cheaper with medium weight feeder steers averaging 279c and heavy feeder steers toping at 305c/kg.  Feeder and restocker heifers met a stronger market.

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of cows, along with a few pens of heifers.  Heifers sold to a top of 245c/kg.  The cow market was down by 9c to 12c with medium weights averaging 184c and heavy cows sold to a top of 205c/kg."
"Numbers were down following disappointing falls of rain early in the week. Quality was fair to good with greater numbers of young slaughter stock available. Most descriptions were available and feeder steers over 400kg were well represented. Cows were in fair numbers and their yield potential was higher than the previous sale. Weaner numbers have begun to reduce, which is normal for the time of the year. There were some very good quality yearling steers yarded, and restockers and lot feeders took advantage of the extra supply.

Handy rainfalls in the northwest of the state were responsible for the cancellation of some scheduled sales, and a few extra buyers attended thus increasing competition considerably on many grades of stock. Steer weaners sold to a strong demand at steady rates while the heifer portion was marginally dearer. Heavier vealers sold at dearer prices under a stronger demand, while all feeder steers and restocker yearling steers also met keen demand for a much dearer set of values. Trade steers were dearer but the heifer portion was firm to slightly dearer.

Bullocks and grown steers met a keen demand also, and the older categories in particular registered increased values. Heavy heifers were in greater numbers and sold at dearer rates for the heaviest and firm rates for lighter grades. Light cows were dearer by 4c/kg under a mixture of restocker and slaughter enquiry, while medium and heavy cows were dearer by an average of 8c/kg. There was little change in the price of the plainer bull yarding.

Top sale price was 195c/kg paid by a restocker for medium weight steer weaners."
"Numbers were down by more than half with most classes of cattle represented.  Weaner type cattle and yearlings were well supplied, while grown steer numbers were down and there was a fair penning of cows.

Quality was mixed with several pens of well finished cattle off crop along with a fair percentage of plainer type weaners and restocker steers.  Competition remained strong for the light weaner steers with restockers competiting for all suitable cattle with the better bred steers making the premium prices.  Feeder buyers were also active in the market on selective lines of steers.   The limited number of young cattle suitable for the trade attracted keen competition. 

The export section consisted mainly of cows with a limited number of grown steers and heifers available.  The quality was fairly good with several pens of steers and cows off crop.  Steers sold to a dearer trend, while cows met an easier market with the heavy cows 10c/kg cheaper and the plainer grades more in places.

The top price of the sale was for a pen of very light weaner steers at 228.2c/kg."
"Numbers were down but the numbers in weaners were very much increased as growers clear out excess prior to the Easter break. Yearling cattle were well supplied but the percentage of top quality cattle was very small. Bullocks and heavy steers were in fair numbers and the tops of the draft were up to last weeks standard. Light cows were in bigger numbers but heavy cows were in small numbers for such a large yarding.

There was a very much cheaper market across all descriptions with all the usual buyers in attendance. Demand is easing rapidly each day. The range of the price falls over all young cattle varied between 10 and 20c/kg with plain heifer yearlings suffering the greatest falls. Best bred steer weaners were 10c/kg cheaper but the plainer bred types in all young cattle were well and truly oversupplied.

Heavy steers and bullocks lost between 15 and 20c/kg from last sale prices with buyers very circumspect in choosing which to buy. There were not too many high yield cattle yarded but enough to see the price difference. Cows lost between 12 and 20c/kg with the lightweight cows showing the smallest price drop. Bulls were cheaper by a similar amount. Feedlotters were not very visible as they struggle to make room for an increasing supply.

The top sale price was 191.6c/kg paid for quality steer weaners to restock."
"Numbers were down again this week with a few weaner steers offered, while light yearling steers and heifers making up the largest percentage of the yarding, while there was only a few grown steers and heifers and a small penning of cows. 

Quality of the young cattle was very plain, although most were well bred cattle that were keenly sought after by both restocker and feeder buyers.  Competition was strong with the better-bred cattle attracting the keenest demand.  There were only a few pens of heifers that went to the trade.

The yarding of export cattle consisted of small numbers, with a few well-finished steers off crop and an odd pen of 2 and 3 score cows that met strong demand."
"Numbers were down again this week but not to the extent of last weeks dramatic decline.  Vealers were once again in light supply while yearlings and cows made up the bulk of the yarding.

Quality was mixed with the majority of the cattle showing the affects of the winter and dry feed. The vealer market followed a similar trend to most other centers with the market slightly easier for the heifer portion, while the steer calves went to restockers. The yearling steers consisted of mainly well bred cattle and met strong competition from restockers and feeders. Yearling heifers were in fair supply and met strong trade demand with feeder buyers also showing increased interest this week.

The export section consisted mainly of cows with some good yielding types through the yarding. The few pens of steers that were yarded were of fair quality and sold to a dearer trend. Cows continued to meet a strong market with restockers active on the light plainer types. The increased yarding of heavy bulls sold at similar rates.

The top price of the sale was 189.2c/kg for lightweight veal."
"Numbers were back slightly but the quality overall was a little better. Very light splitter calves were in fair numbers as were the feeder steers and yearling heifers. There were only a few heavy steers or bullocks but cows were in greater numbers no doubt due to last sales dearer market. A feature of the sale were 10 very heavy muscled and high yielding bulls which sold to a record price and average for the Armidale yards.

The market for young cattle strengthened again as it has for the past month with a dearer trend in the splitter calves which was compensated for by a higher yield. Plain light heifer yearlings sold at similar prices to last sale as did the restocker steer yearlings. Feeder steers were in stronger demand and their prices rose sharply to new local levels also. Restocker steer demand is very keen but most suitable cattle are being bought by feedlotters.

Heavy steers and bullocks sold to a dearer market but there were only a few yarded. The cow market was once again very buoyant with a particularly strong rate available for the medium and heavy weights. The best of the bulls sold at record prices."
"Numbers were back only slightly and quality remained similar to the previous sale. There was a good supply of lightweight heifer vealers and cows throughout the penning. Restocker steer weaners and yearlings along with grown heifers were also well represented, while there was a limited offering of grown steers and bullocks. Suitable cattle for lotfeeders were also in short supply.

A strong field of buyers were active and the market was fully firm to dearer.  Good lines of well-bred restocker steers attracted strong support from a broad field of keen buyers. Weaner steers sold firm for the lightweights while calves in the heavy end met a stronger price trend. Yearling steers suitable for these orders averaged 4c/kg stronger values. Very strong competition on the lightweight heifer vealers pushed values up by 6c/kg.

Most of the steers and bullocks were just there as far as finish was concerned but a dearer set of values was attained with the 3 and 4 score lines selling from 172c to 189c/kg. Export heifers gained good ground with the better finished lines selling from 162c to 181c/kg. The cow market was very strong and rises of 3c to 7c/kg were common with some of the heavy good yielding pens up to 10c/kg stronger."
"Numbers were back a little at Armidale today and so was the quality with plain yearling steers and heifers making up the bulk of the offering. Bullocks were in fair numbers, but most needed a little more time on feed. Cow numbers are increasing slightly and the quality remains only fair.  Trade cattle are in short supply, however most of the yearling steers are going back to restockers or feeders with very few going to slaughter. The usual number of buyers attended the sale with another very consistent market resulting.

Only a few cattle in the yarding sold at a cheaper rate with very light vealers meeting less demand after selling so keenly for so many weeks. Even at the cheaper levels they still create a very satisfactory dollar result for growers. Trade cattle and restocker yearling steers showed no change at all with demand for these types as strong as ever.

The bullocks sold marginally cheaper but the drop in yield of the offering was the cause. The cow market continues to be very steady with prices showing no alteration at all. There do not appear to be many high yield bulls available at this time."
"Numbers were again stable and the quality did not vary from last sale. There were between 500 and 600 cows yarded together with a numbers of splitter vealers and heifer yearlings. Feeder and restocker yearling steers were well supplied but trade cattle and bullocks were short supplied.

The market was once again dearer for very light vealers and yearling heifers with restocker steer yearlings staying at the same prices as last sale. Trade heifers were fully firm while there were insufficient trade steers yarded to quote. The demand for lightweight restocker steer yearling is well under supplied at the moment and values are varying between steady and dearer.

There were not many bullocks or heavy steers in the yard but the few available sold at a dearer rate. Cows sold very strongly and the majority sold to a dearer market once again. The heavy older heifers also sold to a dearer price. Bulls were not very good quality but they sold at firm prices."
"Numbers were again severely limited for the last sale of the financial year in the smallest yarding for many months. Agents anticipate a few bigger sales early in July and not too many cattle after that until October. Quality was fairly plain with weaners,  vealers and cows dominating the offering. There were no bullocks to quote but fair numbers of heavy three score steers were available as well as fair numbers of yearling restocker steers.

The market almost entirely due to the lack of numbers was dearer for most of the younger cattle in particular. Weaner steers to restock rose under a good demand. Heifer vealers in the lighter weights sold strongly with buyers unable to fulfill requirements. Trade and restocker yearlings were also selling at an improved rate.

Heavy steers were in demand from operators with a stronger price the result of the low numbers. The same situation applied to the cow market with the greatest accent from buyers being directed at the better end of the cow yarding. In a reverse situation the bulls and the heavier and older heifers sold at a lower figure for similar quality to last sale.

There was considerable discussion concerning the first sale of the new financial year with most unable to assess the affect if any of the GST on the market."
"Numbers were again severely limited but the quality was again high, with good runs of crop fattened bullocks, and a number of pens of high yielding cows. Restocker young cattle were again in light supply while there were some good numbers of light yearling steers.

Demand was very strong for all young cattle and the market remained fully firm for most, and dearer for restocker steers, both medium and lightweights. The trade steers sold at slightly above the levels of last sale, but the yield estimate was greater by a small percentage.

The bullocks offered were particularly well finished with slightly higher yields anticipated. Grown heifers and cows sold at fully firm rates while there were no feeder steers in the offering. Bulls were down in quality but firm in price.

The top sale price was 210.6c/kg paid by a restocker for a pen of 14, light C2 vealer steers weighing approximately 180kg."
"Numbers were again restricted in a very mixed quality yarding.  The bulk of the offering was yearling steers, highly suitable for restocking.  They varied from a number of lots of very well bred steers, and down to some plainer conditioned lots of secondary quality.  Also available were some good size pens of yearling heifers, which varied from very good quality to some very, light weight and plain bred heifers.  There were no trade cattle or bullocks, and only a few small lots of cows.

With the continuation of heavy frost and little rain in the offering, restockers have become wary of the immediate future, and values for restocker types were cheaper.  The best bred and best presented yearling steers were cheaper by 7c to 8c while secondary types were 10c to 13c/kg cheaper.  Light yearling heifers were cheaper by 10c/kg and there were not enough trade weight cattle to quote.

No bullock or high yield cow quote is possible, but export heifers and the few lighter cow lots were firm.  Bulls were cheaper under a reduced demand from exporters.  Older restocker steers were also cheaper by 10c/kg, but they were well under a reasonable weight for age."
"Numbers were again less, which is the usual procedure following the end of June.  There were some good fat cattle in yearlings and the lightweight bullocks, but they were not in big numbers.  Feeder steers and cows were short supplied and it would appear the all the weaner cattle that growers intend to sell, have in fact been sold.

Trade heifers sold strongly for the best to be 3c/kg dearer.  Restocker young cattle sold at similar rates to the previous sale.  Trade-weight heavy steers were unchanged.  It was very noticeable that the local demand for plain quality weaners has dried up, with growers not having the feed or having to carry any extra cattle in the dead of a bad winter.

Bullocks sold well under keen demand and they were 3c/kg dearer as were the plain cows. The balance of the cow yarding sold at a steady rate. The few export feeder steers were not outstanding quality but they sold at unchanged rates."
"Numbers showed a further increase with yearlings well represented. There was also a good supply of cows. The quality of the offering was very mixed with some very well bred cattle just lacking condition. That condition was at a premium with very few well finished cattle available. The standout were a couple of pens of supplementary fed heavy grown steers. There was reduced processor competition with a couple of major processors not operating. There were no live export orders in the bull market. Restockers were particularly active however there were minimal numbers of cattle suitable to feed. 

Market trends through the young cattle were generally cheaper with quality a major factor. The well bred light weight yearling steers saw an odd firm to slighty dearer sale. Breed and quality contributed greatly to the significant price change on the heavier yearling steers to feed. Trends were similar for the yearling heifers, selling up to 20c/kg cheaper. The well bred, out of condition lots attracted stronger competition than the plainer quality pens.

Those heavy grown steers that had been treated with a HGP, with nothing to compare to from the previous sale, there is no market comment possible. Well finished grown heifers to processors sold to a cheaper trend with reduced processor competition. The plainer quality and condition grown heifers sold to much cheaper trends. With restockers active, the plainer condition light and medium weight cows sold to a dearer trend. The plainer cows struggled to attract demand. 3 and 4 score cows sold to a slightly cheaper trend, despite two buyers being out of the market. Heavy bulls sold to a much cheaper trend, up to 40c/kg, with the reduced competition the driving factor."
"Numbers showed a decline with this trend predicted to continue. All grades were represented with a good supply of young cattle and cows as well as a good line-up of heavy steers. Overall the quality of the young cattle and cows was below last week with most of the young cattle showing the effects of cold weather, rapidly dropping weight, yield and condition. All regular buyers were in attendance for what was a solid market.

Vealer steers to restockers sold to a firm trend although there was a noticeable drop in breed quality. Heifer vealers sold to a dearer trend, up 4c/kg, with most of the 2 scores this week going to processors. Those to restockers lacked the quality of last weeks offering. The 3 score trade vealers also sold to a dearer trend for the limited offering. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders saw little change. Heifer yearlings to feed also saw a drop in quality with this accounting for any price variations. Trade yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 4c/kg, with increased competition brought about by a shortage in suitable cattle.

Heavy steers sold at firm rates with most being 4 and 6 teeth. Grown heifers sold firm to dearer. The quality of the cow offering was not as good as last week with this accounting for price variations in what was a market that saw little change. Once again restockers were active on the plain condition cows with larger frames."
"Numbers settled back into a more regular pattern following the break with more medium and heavy cattle yarded compared to the usual numbers of lightweight cattle. Quality varied quite a lot, but generally the average was a little better than has been seen this season. Heavy steers and bullocks were in fair numbers and they displayed quite good finish. Trade cattle were short supplied and so were feeder and restock steers. Cows were in fair numbers and included some more high yielding types. There were more orders in the market this week resulting in another very strong sale.

Light vealer calves sold at firm rates while trade cattle were marginally dearer. Restocker steer yearlings were battling to maintain the rates of recent weeks with growers losing just a little interest as the feed matures. The yearling feeder steers however, sold strongly to record slight rises in price.

There were some very well finished steers and bullocks yarded and demand was very keen with prices a little dearer than the previous week. The cow market continues at good prices as the numbers available are not great. There were some dearer sales noted, but generally the prices are very stable. The bull price has settled down at moderate figures after some time at very high prices."
"Numbers settled back into a more normal pattern this week as the season dries off in hotter weather. Quality of the yarding was the best this season with feeder steers and splitter vealers making up the bulk of the yarding. Heavy steers and bullocks were in fair supply while cows were 15% of the total. The same buying companies as last sale were represented.

The market was fairly steady for the bigger numbers of feeder steers available with good competition for all weights. Trade cattle eased marginally but there were not enough suitable cattle in the yarding to warrant some buyers starting. Restocker steer buyers were keen to obtain numbers and this kept the market at a very steady level even though the country is drying off seasonally. The big change in the market was felt by the splitter calves, which lost very considerable price under a much weaker demand. The average fall in price varied between 25 and 33c/kg.

The export feeder steers also sold at solid and unaltered levels as did the heavy slaughter steers and bullocks. The medium and heavy cows met a little less competition and sold at a little cheaper rates. Bulls generally were poor quality but their market was much cheaper."
"Numbers seem to have settled into a steady pattern but are more likely to build up in the autumn. Quality was very similar to last week with not a lot of prime cattle available. The very light splitter vealers were in fair numbers as were yearlings and cows. There were a few pens of average quality only bullocks and bulls were in good numbers. Feeder steers and restockers steers were well supplied.

The usual regular buyers attended the sale. The light vealers under 200kg met a quiet market after some weeks of top prices and they lost a considerable percentage of their value. The trade cattle in the market were fully firm and their market was very steady. Feeder steers and restocker steers of the better quality showed no change but the off type cattle sold to a definite cheaper trend. There were no yearling steers yarded that went to slaughter as restockers and feedlots bought them all.

The bullock sold at firm to slightly dearer rates and there was a definite sign that the numbers available are starting to reduce and the next few weeks should confirm the fact.  There was another very strong demand for all cows and bulls with prices very stable across all weights. The drop on the value of the Australian dollar is being welcomed by all local cattlemen."
"Numbers rose considerably due to the inclusion in the sale of a number of cows and calves and young cattle off properties recently sold. Quality in the fat cattle, which made up one third of the yarding, was fair to good with some very well finished bullocks available together with numbers of trade heifers and feeder steers. Cows were in fair numbers and were of medium yield only. Feeder steers were also in good numbers with the breed quality fair.

There were some remarkable and unexpected price rises in the market as buyers attempted to compensate for the shortage of cattle currently coming out of Queensland. All categories showed considerable price improvement with feeder cattle and light vealers and yearling heifers selling between 9c and 16c/kg dearer. Restocker steers also sold to a similar price rise.

A very large rise was also experienced in the heavy steers and the bullocks with 14c/kg rises common place. A similar elevation in the cow price was seen and most weights and fat scores were under a much stronger demand. The heavy export heifers again came under pressure with the price dearer for the third successive week, while bull prices also improved.

The top sale price was 267.2c/kg paid for very light heifer vealers."
"Numbers returned to a normal level after the very small penning last week. Most categories were in fair supply with the exception of well finished heavy grown steers. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering. The quality of the young cattle was generally good, while the condition was more conducive to restock and feeding purposes. There were some reasonably well finished cows penned alongside some very good store cows. The regular processors were in attendance while the increased numbers brought in extra feedlot and restocker buyers. Demand for all categories was high, particularly for those to restock and feed.

Dearer trends for the most part through the young cattle, however with limited numbers to compare to an actual price comparison would be difficult. There were significant price improvements for all young cattle to restock and feed with quality improvements also contributing. Trade buyers had a struggle to secure good quality cattle as restock and feed orders continually outbid them. The only young cattle purchased by the trade were either deemed to be to light to feed or of a quality not suitable.

There were insufficient heavy grown steers to quote. Feedlot orders competed strongly on grown heifers with the market dearer. There were premiums for 2 teeth heifers, while most of the 4 and 6 teeth heifers were plain quality. Restockers were active on plain condition cows at strong prices, while cows to process met solid competition to sell firm to slightly dearer. Bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"Numbers remained the same in a very mixed quality yarding. The quality varied with a large supply of plain unfinished cattle with a scattered amount of well-conditioned heifers. There was less competition evident particularly on yearling steers to restockers and feeders as well as the better quality vealer heifers.

Trends varied with steer vealers to restock selling firm to 2c cheaper on the lighter weights, averaging 219c, while the heavier class sold 7c/kg dearer. The C2 heifer vealers saw little change despite the reduced competition. Light yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend, down 2c to top 211c/kg with quality influencing price changes. Medium C2 heifer yearlings sold dearer averaging 194c and 178c/kg, respectively. The increased supply of well finished heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend.

There was a small number of heavy steers suitable for processors with the market showing a cheaper trend. The light grown heifers were also of better quality with prices ranging from 138c to 179c averaging 174c/kg. The cow market varied for quality in some cases, however the better heavy cows were slightly dearer up 7c/kg."
"Numbers remained steady. Due to the continued low numbers, the sale will be taking place on a fortnightly basis from now until further notice. It was a mostly plain quality and condition offering, although there were some well finished yearling heifers. There was restricted processor and feedlot competition, however there were a few restockers operating.

There were insufficient numbers within categorised weight classes for a reliable quote on market trends, with quality variations also contributing to price change. The better quality cattle in each category remained close to firm, however the plain cattle attracted little interest. The few well finished yearling heifers, suitable to the trade, sold to a dearer trend.

A single small pen of well finished heavy grown steers sold at prices similar to other centres. The best of the cows were slightly dearer, while the mostly plain condition cows were firm to cheaper. Heavy bulls saw a significantly cheaper market trend."
"Numbers remained steady, while the quality of the offering was mostly good. There was a good supply of well finished grown cattle, while the majority of the young cattle were best suited to restocker and feeder orders. The usual buyers were in attendance with the return of an export processor.

Market trends varied throughout the young cattle with local restockers competing strongly for light and medium weight steer weaners. The heifer portion attracted both processor and restocker competition with the market trend 5c to 17c/kg dearer, most purchased by the restockers. Yearling steers to restock and feed mostly sold to cheaper trends, there was however a single pen of medium weights to a restocker that experienced a price improvement. A reduction in quality and a change in breed were major factors in the yearling heifers to feed showing much cheaper prices.

A vastly improved quality penning of heavy grown steers attracted processor competition, however market trends were cheaper. The well finished grown heifers sold on a firm to slightly cheaper market trend, with quality showing an improvement. Despite the increased competition the cow market showed a cheaper trend of 3c to 7c/kg. The best of the heavy weight bulls saw a significantly cheaper market trend."
"Numbers remained steady, comprising large numbers of light and medium weight vealers and yearlings. The quality of the offering was fair to good however apart from a few cows there were limited numbers of well finished cattle available. Restocker demand was high in preparation for what could be very good spring seasonal conditions.

The market for restocker cattle was very strong with vealer steers averaging 18c to 20c/kg dearer, while there were odd sales up to 30c/kg higher. Vealer heifers to restockers were up to 11c/kg dearer. Lightweight yearling steers to restockers saw a dearer trend of 12c to 14c/kg. There was restricted feedlot competition on the limited supply of medium and heavy yearling steers resulting in those steers selling to a cheaper trend. Medium weights to backgrounding operations were firm to dearer. Yearling heifers in the light and medium weight ranges were 13c to 20c/kg dearer.

There were too few grown steers and heifers to quote a trend. The cow market saw cheaper trends for the most part, with odd sales in the heavy weights remaining firm."
"Numbers remained steady with young cattle and cows well supplied. There were a few well finished grown heifers, very few heavy grown steers. The quality of the offering was mostly good with limited numbers of secondary cattle penned. There were quite a few well finished lots with processors well catered for. There was increased processor competition, mostly domestic. There was a greater presence of restocker and feedlot buyers.

There was strong demand from restockers for lightweight cattle, the vealer steers experiencing strong gains. The heavier weights showing little change in trend.  The heifer portion followed a similar trend. Medium and heavyweight yearling steers to feed saw little but quality and breed related price change. Lightweight yearling heifers to restockers sold to cheaper trends. Medium and heavy weights up to 25c/kg dearer in places, some of that was quality.

Well finished grown heifers to processors saw little but quality related price change. Breed was a factor in some very strong sale of heifers to restockers. There was little change in the cow market with a good supply of heavyweights. The best of the heavy bulls remained firm."
"Numbers remained steady with yearlings well supplied. The quality of the yearlings was very mixed with a few secondary quality lots penned. The majority were lightweight with some well finished light and medium weight heifer yearlings. There were too few heavy grown steers to quote while there was a limited supply of cows. All regular processors were in attendance along with increased restocker and feeder competition.

The young cattle market showed variable trends. Restocker demand for steers was high regardless of quality. The good quality yearling steers carrying reasonable weight sold to a firm to slightly cheaper trend. Secondary quality steers carrying little weight and lacking muscle sold to a dearer trend of 20c/kg. The lightweight heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend with 2 scores to the trade and feed falling 13c to 18c/kg while those to restock were less affected, to be 2c to 6c/kg cheaper. Medium and heavy 3 score trade heifers sold 8c to 15c/kg dearer for a better quality.

Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. The cow market was very strong with plain condition cows dearer by 7c/kg with restockers active on suitable lines. Well finished heavy cows attracted strong demand to show a dearer trend of as much as 13c/kg."
"Numbers remained steady with vealers and cows making up a large percentage. There were a few yearlings, not many grown steers and heifers. Quality was fair to good while condition was reflective of the tough seasonal conditions. The usual processors were in attendance and there was increased restocker competition, buoyed by a rain forecast.

There were varying trends through the young cattle, with most of the light and medium weight steer weaners to restock showing little, but quality related price change. There was a single pen late in the sale that was 30c/kg dearer. The heavier weight steer vealers to restock and feed were 2c to 3c/kg dearer. Heifer vealers to restock recovered much of the previous weeks price fall. Medium and heavy yearling steers sold to a dearer trend of 10c to 20c/kg with some improvement in quality. The light and medium weight heifer yearlings to feed sold to a cheaper trend, while the heavy feeders were slightly dearer.

There were insufficient grown steers and heifers to quote. The cow market was dearer for the most part, up by 6c to 12c/kg. Limited restocker competition and breed variation saw prices for medium weights lower."
"Numbers remained steady with quality only fair. Condition was variable with a limited number of well finished young cattle. The majority of the vealers had lost their freshness. All regular processors were in attendance; however, a couple did not operate with insufficient suitable cattle to make loads.

Restocker activity was down, particularly for the light and medium weight vealer steers. The market cheaper, down 5c to 23c/kg with the light weights most affected. Heavier steer vealers sold at dearer rates with buyers looking to take more weight and condition into the winter. Heifer vealers also sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 4c/kg. The quality of the yearling steers was down with this reflected in prices. Odd pens of good quality feeders were slightly dearer. Heifer yearlings followed a similar trend cheaper, down 4c to 8c/kg.

There were insufficient heavy steers to quote. Processor cows sold to a cheaper trend, down 5c to 7c/kg. A couple of restocker orders caused suitable plainer condition cows sell to a dearer trend, up 3c to 5c/kg."
"Numbers remained steady with heavy weight cattle well supplied. Light weight cattle were limited in supply. Quality and condition was mostly good, with very few in the plainer grades. The usual processors were in attendance along with extra feedlot competition. Trends varied from the sale a fortnight ago.

Vealers to restockers sold to cheaper trends for both steers and heifers. Some heavy weights to processors struggled to maintain their recent levels. Medium weight yearling steers to restockers and feeders experienced little but quality related price change. A good supply of heavy weight yearling steers suitable to feed experienced a significantly dearer market trend with breed and quality variations accounting for a large price range. Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers attracted strong demand to also sell to a dearer trend, price improvement not as great as the steer portion.

Heavy weight grown steers over 500kg to feed sold to a much dearer trend. An improved quality penning of heavy steers suitable to processors sold to a dearer trend with increased competition. Well finished heavy grown heifers sold on a firm to dearer trend. Well finished heavy weight cows sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend with great variation in quality. Restockers were active on plainer condition, and joined cows, with the trend dearer. Heavy weight bulls sold to a slightly dearer trend.  

Market reporter, James Armitage."
"Numbers remained steady with cows well supplied. There were reduced supplies of vealers with increased numbers in the yearling classes. Quality was quite mixed with the majority in plain condition reflecting seasonal conditions and there were a few well finished older cattle. Although there was good restocker support, there was limited export processor competition.

Dearer market trends showed through the majority of the young cattle. Steer vealers to restock were firm to 8c/kg dearer with most falling into the light and medium weight classes. Increased demand from both restocker and processing orders for heifer vealers resulted in dearer trends, by 4c to 10c/kg. In both the steer and heifer vealer categories, there were quality related price changes. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed attracted strong gains with the biggest price change being for well-bred steers out of condition. The better quality yearling heifers attracted increased demand, recording solid price gains. 

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend, despite limited processor competition. The plainest condition light and medium weight cows sold to a cheaper trend. The better quality and conditioned cows to restock attracted increased demand with the market trend up to 6c/kg dearer. Despite only 2 processors operating, the better finished 3 and 4 score cows sold to a dearer trend, up to 10c/kg."
"Numbers remained steady with all categories represented. There was a limited supply of heifer yearlings and well finished heavy grown steers. The quality of the offering was fairly mixed, some very good heavy vealer steers. The condition of the young cattle was more suited to restocker and feeder orders, with limited numbers suitable to the trade. The regular processors and feedlot orders were in place for a market of varying trends.

Restockers competed strongly on the 200-280kg vealer steers, with the market trend dearer. There was less demand for the heavier weights, with that market trend cheaper, and breed was a contributing factor. Vealer heifers sold firm to 7c/kg cheaper for the medium and heavy weights. Feeder orders were active on the medium and heavy weights, with little but quality related price change. The limited supply of heifer yearlings sold to similar trends.

Grown steers with 2 or more teeth suitable to feed sold to a dearer trend, with breed quality contributing to a lift in average prices. The better quality grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. There was some good restocker activity on the plainer condition cows, with this contributing to a firm market trend. Cows to process sold to a cheaper trend for the most part, with better quality cows making the same top price form the previous sale. A lift in quality and competition resulted in heavy bulls selling to a dearer trend."
"Numbers remained steady with a large offering of vealers and cows. The quality of the offering was very mixed and there were very few well finished lots available. The usual restocker orders were in place for the young cattle and there was extra restocker competition on the plainer condition cows. There was restricted processor competition on both young and grown cattle.

Cheaper trends for the most part through the young cattle with steer vealers to restock selling up to 20c/kg cheaper. Quality variations accounted for much of the difference in price change. Heifer vealers to restockers followed a similar trend as cold weather impacts confidence in the ability to improve condition of light weight cattle over the coming months on grass. The few well finished vealers also sold to a cheaper trend, down 6c/kg. A very small penning of yearling steers saw heavy feeders sell to a cheaper trend, with quality contributing to price falls. There were significant price reductions for yearling heifers to restock and feed with the medium and in particular the heavyweights least affected.

There were too few well finished heavy steers to quote, with most of the grown steers more suited to feed on. Cows to process suffered from a lack of demand and competition to sell to a much cheaper trend. There was quite a bit of competition from restockers on the plain condition cows showing good frame with the market remaining firm."
"Numbers remained steady with a good supply of yearlings. All other categories were represented with cows making up the bulk of the grown cattle. Quality was very mixed through the young cattle with some very well bred lines available. There were however quite a few secondary quality young cattle penned. Export processor attendance was reduced in the wind down to Christmas, however there was a good line up of restocker and feedlot buyers.

Apart from the good quality weaners steers to restock and a few very good quality yearling heifers market trends were generally cheaper through the young cattle. Secondary quality light and medium weight yearlings were hardest hit with little competition. The better quality medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed were up to 8c/kg cheaper. The well-bred yearling heifers to restock and feed saw odd sales remain firm, while the balance of the heifers to both the trade and restockers were cheaper.

Well finished heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend of 5c on the better quality lots and as much as 11c/kg on the plainer quality lots. The cow market suffered from reduced demand and also reduced buyer participation to show a cheaper trend of 12c to 13c/kg on the well finished heavy weights. The heavy bull market was slightly cheaper, up to 4c/kg, while there were some very heavy weights penned."
"Numbers remained steady for the last sale of the financial year. Almost 75% of the penning were vealers, with all other categories but cows in limited numbers. There were few well finished young cattle penned. Once again export processor competition was restricted to a few while restocker competition for steers increased.

Demand for the good quality vealer steers from restockers was high resulting in a firm to dearer market, up to 3c/kg. Secondary quality steer vealers sold at cheaper rates. Heifer vealers followed a similar trend, firm to slightly dearer but with some quality related variations. There were very few yearling steers penned with little but quality related price variations. Heavy trade heifer yearlings sold firm to slightly dearer with an improvement in average quality.

The limited supply of heavy steers remained firm, while there was little but quality related changes in the cow market."
"Numbers remained steady at Armidale this week. There was a good quality penning of young cattle, mainly vealers and the quality and condition of the grown cattle and cows was also very good. There was a small group of buyers in attendance, however participation levels were high.

Restocker demand was high through the light weight young cattle which saw vealers sell to a significantly dearer trend. The limited supply of yearling steers to restock and feed saw a firm to dearer trend, while the yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends.

Heavy grown steers over 500kg, including the milk tooth lines, sold to cheaper trends with breed and extra weight contributing to the lower prices. Well finished grown heifers to processors also sold to cheaper trends. The quality of the cows contributed to higher prices in a dearer market where the best of the heavy weights improved by as much as 20c/kg. There was increased demand for bulls with all classes selling to dearer trends.

Market Reporter, James Armitage."
"Numbers remained steady at 333 head. The overall quality of the offering was fair to good with some very good vealers and yearlings. There was a fair supply of grown cattle however bull numbers were well down. There was restricted processor competition on grown cattle, particularly in the bull market. Restocker and feedlot activity was high with a number of extra participants.

There were varying trends through the young cattle where the better quality lightweight vealer and steer yearlings sold to dearer trends. Some of the plainer quality steers struggled to maintain recent levels. The medium and heavy weight yearling steers sold to dearer trends with increased competition, posting strong gains. All the better quality vealer and yearling heifers to restock and feed met strong demand to follow similar trends to those of the steers. Breed did play a part in some price change. A small number of well finished vealer heifers attracted keen trade demand.

There were a couple of pens of heavyweight grown steers suitable to processors, no market comparison available. Well finished grown heifers were keenly sought by both processors and feedlots to sell to dearer trends. The export market was weaker with cows selling to cheaper trends of as much as 10c/kg on the better heavyweights. Reduced competition resulted in the heavy bulls showing a substantially cheaper trend.

Market reporter, James Armitage."
"Numbers remained steady as the pre-winter sell off continues. There were good supplies of vealers, while yearling numbers were down. Cows made up the bulk of the grown cattle with small numbers of grown steers and heifers suitable to process. The overall quality of the offering was mixed with condition of the young cattle in particular better suited to restocker or feeder orders. Apart from cows there were limited opportunities for processors to procure well finished cattle. Most of the usual buyers were in attendance however demand across all sectors was down.

Market trends for all classes of young cattle were cheaper with the reduced demand with significant price falls recorded. Variations in quality also contributed to the fall in average prices. Vealers to restock saw cheaper trends of at least 20c/kg and more in places. Vealer heifers suitable to processors were also cheaper, however less affected. Medium and heavy yearling feeder steers were up to 10c/kg cheaper, while there was minimal competition for lightweight yearling steers. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed saw the market trend cheaper by 30c/kg for the good quality cattle and more for the secondary quality lots.

There were too few well finished heavy grown steers purchased by processors for a quote. A very mixed quality and condition penning of grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend. The cow market was up to 11c cheaper on the better quality medium and heavyweights with the best pen of cows only down by 5c/kg. The plainer condition cows attracted little restocker competition to also show a much cheaper market trend."
"Numbers remained similar with young cattle making up the bulk of the offering. There was a very small penning of grown cattle. The quality of the yarding was very mixed and consisted of a large number of very light cattle. For the most part the condition of the cattle was only fair. Most regular processors were in attendance however the low number of suitable cattle saw not all requirements satisfied.

The young cattle attracted very spirited competition from both restockers and processors resulting in most categories experiencing dearer trends. Very light vealers to restock improved by up to 11c/kg, both steers and heifers. Yearling steers to restock remained firm. The plainer quality, lightly muscled steers sold to a cheaper trend. Light weight heifer yearlings also attracted strong demand with both restocker and trade heifers seeing a dearer trend, up 8c to 10c/kg. As with the steers, the plain quality heifers sold to a cheaper trend.

The limited number of grown cattle sold to a dearer trend, with heavy steers up 5c/kg. The quality of the grown heifers improved as did the market, the trend, up 10c to 12c/kg. The cow market showed a dearer trend also."
"Numbers remained similar to the previous sale. There was an increase supply of vealers and heavy grown steers, while all other categories were also represented. Overall the quality was mixed. The regular processors were in attendance, however, not all feedlot and restocker orders were in place.

The young cattle market experienced cheaper trends for the most part. The exceptions were the light and medium weight vealer steers to restockers which were dearer, up 9c to 19c/kg. A small number of heavy vealer steers were slightly cheaper. Heifer vealers averaged cheaper, however, this was related to quality variations, with the best processors vealers slightly dearer. Yearling steers suffered with the absence of a couple of orders, with the market showing a cheaper trend, down 9c to 19c/kg. Heifer yearlings also sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 9c/kg.

An increased supply of heavy grown steers sold to processors at dearer rates and this was in the most part quality related. Feeder steers with 2 or more teeth sold cheaper. There was a fair supply of cows suitable to the restockers that sold firm, as did the medium weights to processors. The heavy cows eased with the market down 6c to 7c/kg."
"Numbers remained similar to last week. The quality offered was only fair with limited numbers of well finished cattle penned. There were quite a number of plain quality and conditioned cattle offered. Not all regular buyers were in attendance.

Young cattle made up the bulk offered with some well bred lines of yearling steers and some good quality plainer conditioned heifers. The majority of the steers were purchased by restockers with the lightweight grades generally firm for the best quality and cheaper on the plain quality lines. There was quite a drop in quality in some of the D muscle steers that resulted in average prices being much lower than the actual market trend. In contrast there was an improved quality offered of medium weights with the market trend dearer by 5c to 8c/kg.

Trade yearling heifers met with weaker competition, the market firm to 10c/kg. Restocker yearling heifers also firm to cheaper. There was some quality issues involved in the drop in prices.

There were insufficient grown cattle of any quality for a reliable market quote, suffice to say rates paid were similar to those of last week for similar quality cattle."
"Numbers remained similar and all the regular buyers were in attendance. Generally the quality was fair to good, although there were some plainer quality cattle in the offering. Most grades were represented with lesser numbers of heavy steers penned. Vealer numbers continue to increase. 

The market for young cattle was reasonably solid throughout. The plainer quality yearlings met weaker demand and sold at cheaper rates. The light and medium weight heifer vealers to processors sold to an easier trend with restockers also active. Those restockers underpinned the market preventing rates from falling further. The best quality vealer and yearling steers to restocker orders sold at firm rates, an overall drop in quality saw averages decline. Trade heifer yearlings sold to an easier trend, down 1c to 5c/kg. The trend was the same for those heifer yearlings going on to feed.

There was a limited number of heavy steers with the majority carrying 4 or more teeth. As a result average values were down, the market trend however was firm. Grown heifers sold firm to dearer, once again age was a factor in the average price increase with quite a number only carrying 2 teeth. There was little or no change in the cow market with all grades selling up to last weeks values despite the new record value of the Australian dollar."
"Numbers remained at about an expected level considering the numbers of weaners that are currently being offered at local special weaner sales. The majority of the descriptions in the yarding were weaners and yearlings of a fair and reasonable average quality. There were enough heavy steers and bullocks available to quote a market trend while feeder steers between 330kg and 460kg were in fair numbers and were good breed quality. Cows were not in big numbers and their quality was similar to last day except for a few less of the really heavy cows. 

There was again some variation in demand in the market with a cheaper trend obvious for most weaners either heifers to slaughter or steers to restockers. The trade heifers remained unchanged in price as did the yearling steers being bought by district restockers. Some of the feeder steers were selling at improved values but these were the better quality cattle in the yarding only. The demand for feeders and restock steers is still very strong but local demand is waning somewhat.

The enquiry for heavy steers and bullocks improved again with price rises of 2c to 4 c/kg the order of the day. It is now very obvious that there are very few heavy bullocks still on feed  as very few indeed are reaching the sales. The cow market did not change much with a good demand for all descriptions evident. There was some restricted demand for fattening cows from restockers but at fairly well governed prices only."
"Numbers reduced, with yearlings making up the bulk of the offering. Quality and condition was fair to good with a few heavy grown steers and yearling heifers off crop. There was also a line of PTIC cows that were sold on a per head basis. Not all processor orders were in operation, however restocker competition was solid.

Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold at similar prices to the previous sale, however weights were down. There were insufficient medium and heavy yearling steers to quote. Prices for yearlings heifers were mostly firm except for quality related price changes and there was nothing from the previous sale to compare the 3 score trade heifers too.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend, up 6c/kg. The cow market also saw a dearer trend, up 3c to 4c/kg. The majority of the PTIC cows sold to restockers on a dollar per head basis and made from $600 to $850/head."
"Numbers reduced with less vealers penned. All categories were represented in an offering that saw quality very mixed. Condition ranged from very plain through to well-finished supplementary fed yearlings. There was limited export processor competition with most of the regular trade and restocker orders in place.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with breed and quality responsible for cheaper prices for steer vealers returning to the paddock. Heifer vealers had reduced restocker and processor competition to sell to a cheaper trend. A small number of well finished heifer vealers suitable to the trade were dearer. Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold to cheaper trends with some quality related variations. The medium weight steers to restock and feed saw quality related variations where the better quality lots remained firm and the secondary lots cheaper. There were some heavy feeders yarded this week. There were cheaper trends through heifer yearlings to restock and feed, with well finished heifers to the trade remained firm.

Well finished heavy steers attracted fair competition, however no market trend is available due to a lack of comparative cattle last week. A line of very plain condition, lightweight older steers sold strongly in comparison to the better quality yearling steers. The cow market saw trends generally cheaper with some of the better store cows remaining firm."
"Numbers reduced to offer increased weights through the yearling steers and a penning of heavy cows. The balance of the yarding showed good quality and condition for most grades along with limited pens of heavy milk veal. Feeder competition was strong, however, not a lot of light cattle available for the restocker market. All the regular buyers attended and operated.

Bobby calves, fresh off the cow sold to 676c/kg. Competition for weaner steers was strong with significant gains achieved. The heifer portion was not as competitive with lack of numbers the main cause. Included in the offering were a limited number of heavy heifer veal and these sold to strong trends. Yearling steers to feed sold to dearer trends. Medium weights experienced a rise of 19c/kg, but the same did not apply to the heavy weights which were marginally cheaper, back 4c/kg. Medium weights back to the paddock rose 7c/kg. The heifer offering was cheaper for all grades. Light heifers to the paddock back 14c/kg. Medium weights to feed, only slightly cheaper, losing 2c/kg. Grown steers to feed dropped 10c to 13c/kg. 

Heavy steers to the trade lost 3c, the heifer portion back 4c/kg. Medium weight cows sold to significant rises. The heavy 4 and 5 score cows 4c/kg better. Heavy bulls sold to cheaper trends. A small penning of cows with fresh calves at foot made $2700 to $3100/head."
"Numbers reduced slightly to see a very good quality yarding of weaner cattle in particular steers heading back to the paddock to grow out. Restockers offered strong competition leaving the feeder buyers operating on a reduced basis. The regular exporters were present to see varying trends in the cow market with the heavy 4 score cows selling to a slightly dearer market.

Annual drafts of very well bred steer weaners were on offer selling to considerably dearer trends. Light calves, in particular, estimated at 220 to 230 kg selling to a top of 752c/kg. The heavier drafts also sold to a dearer trend improving some 14c/kg. Weaner heifers attracted strong demand from restockers with a large draft of 60 head making to 610c/kg. Light and medium weight steers sold to dearer trends. The better drafts of feeder cattle did sell to a dearer trend, however, the secondary quality types saw averages reduce considerably. Yearling heifers sold to similar trends with secondary types causing averages to fall. Heifers to processors varied with medium weights dearer and the heavy weights firm.

Very heavy steers to process were cheaper as were the heifer portion retreating some 7 to 10c/kg. A limited number of cows saw the heavy 4 score types sell to a dearer market. The heavy 3 score cows sold marginally cheaper. Heavy Cows with excessive cover were back 15c/kg. Bulls were 10c/kg dearer on previous markets.

Market Reporter Stephen Adams"
"Numbers reduced slightly to offer a very good selection of heavy, well finished cows, along with a variation in quality of the young cattle penned. Restockers competed on these categories to see a cheaper trend emerge. Feeders saw a mostly dearer trend and there were a quite a few heavy grown heifers available. All the regular processors were present, with one exception.

Limited supplies of light young steers saw a cheaper trend except for the very light, plain drafts, up 14c/kg from two weeks ago. The medium weights to feed sold to dearer trends, up 30c/kg. An isolated sale of some good quality light heifers to do a designated feeder job sold to a substantial rise. Other restocker drafts sold to a cheaper trend, back 22c/kg. The medium feeder heifers sold to a marginally cheaper trend. Trade heifers were dearer by 18 to 21c/kg.

No numbers of grown steers to quote, however, grown heifers sold to dearer trends of 35c/kg. A lift in both quality and weight through the cow sale saw dearer trends prevail. Store competition saw that category rise 33c/kg. Medium weight D3 cows rose 17c, with the heavy D3 and D4 types seeing dearer trends of 10c to 14c/kg. An improved bull penning saw a rise of 14c/kg."
"Numbers reduced slightly at Armidale today, but the quality in most categories was marginally improved. Light vealers, grown steers, bullocks and yearlings made up the bulk of the offering, but there were not many cows or bulls available.Yearling steers were in fair numbers, but not enough to satisfy the strong restocker market.  The usual buyers attended the sale and the market trend was basically firm.   

Light vealers, yearlings to slaughter and the restocker yearling steers sold at the same rates as last week and while some pens of trade heifers sold at dearer rates it is not reflected in the averages. The demand for the vealers around 100kg dressed remains solid with prices stabilising in the last two weeks.

Heavy steers stayed fully firm and while the bullocks sold to a higher top price, their yield was above the last sale yields. The cow market showed an irregular pattern with prices received similar to last sale. However, auctioneers hard to work had to achieve those levels. The bulls were plain quality and sold to a marginally cheaper trend.

Overall the market was firm, but prices were harder to realise than in some recent sales."
"Numbers reduced in an opposite trend to other northern markets for the week. The quality of the yarding was plain with large numbers of yearlings, mainly restocker and feeder types, some pens of good cows, and all other descriptions were in limited numbers. Of the yearling cattle, heifers were in bigger lots while better-bred yearling steers were difficult to source. There were a few pens of unfinished bullocks and heavy steers yarded, but quality was generally below standard.

Demand for feeder and restocker young cattle was maintained at a steady level with the keenest bidding being reserved for the very light weight yearlings to restock, and the heavier feeder steers to feed on. There were a number of pens of very lightweight yearling steers which sold at marginally dearer levels. There were not enough trade cattle yarded to provide a market quote.

Heavy steers and bullocks sold at cheaper rates with the exceptio of a few lots, and the fall in price was due to a drop in yield. Demand and competition on cows was reduced and the market for the medium and heavy cows was cheaper by 10c to 15c/kg. Export heifers managed to maintain a firm rates while most of the bulls sold at cheaper rates.

The top sale price was 257.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight steer yearlings."
"Numbers reduced for the last reported sale this year. Both young and grown cattle were well supplied in what was a very mixed quality offering showing varying degrees of finish. There were some very good heavy grown steers and some good quality young cattle, along with quite a few secondary lots. Not all regular processors were in attendance, although restocker and feeder competition was solid.

The market for yearling steers saw more quality related price changes than anything, with the better quality lots equal to the previous sale. The majority of the secondary and very plain quality lightweight steers sold to a cheaper trend with an isolated sale remaining firm. Breed quality was the contributing factor in that sale. There was more variation in the market for heifer yearlings with the better quality lots to restock and feed remaining firm, while average quality variations had an effect on price change. Once again plain lightweights sold to a cheaper trend.

The heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c/kg. Grown steers and heifers attracted limited competition with demand weaker. This resulted in trend being cheaper with price falls quite significant."
"Numbers reduced following substantial rainfall that saw upwards of 90mm in the area. The quality of the offering was very mixed and consisted of mainly yearlings, while grown heifers and cows were well represented. There were too few heavy steers to quote with most of the grown steers falling into the lighter weight classes. The regular processors were in attendance.

The market for lightweight yearling steers was cheaper, averaging 7c/kg down with some quality issues. The medium weights to restockers remained firm for a better quality offering. There was an increased number of heavier weights penned, attracting good support from restockers. Lightweight heifer yearlings sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 8c/kg, once again quality played a part in price changes. 

Grown heifers were in greater numbers and sold to a dearer trend with the lighter weights 1c to 8c/kg dearer. The only reason for the negative price change in the heavy weights was age, with most carrying 4 or 6 teeth. The overall quality of the penning of cows was well down, although the market trend was dearer with medium weights up 2c to 9c and the heavy weights up 5c/kg."
"Numbers reduced as the quality and condition of the offering was similar to previous weeks with a few handy trade cattle and cows. The majority however were showing the effects of winter. All regular buyers were in attendance as well as extra competition on young cattle.

The young cattle market had a brighter tendency this week. Most grades showed a firm to dearer trend. There were however odd grades that realised a cheaper average due to quality variations. The extra competition on trade cattle also helped a little. Restocker vealer steers sold mostly firm, odd sales 3c/kg dearer. Heifer vealers sold firm to 2c/kg dearer with a few at the top end even dearer. Yearling steers to restockers were 2c to 7c/kg dearer. Trade yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 5c to 10c, while the restocker heifers were up by 5c/kg.

The quality of the heavy steers was not up to last week, this resulted in cheaper rates being received. The cow market was stronger with the plain conditioned cows 3c to 9c dearer and the better conditioned 3 and 4 score cows firm to 4c/kg up. Bulls also realised a dearer trend."
"Numbers offered were stable and similar to the last sale for quality in both condition and breed. Yearling steers and heifers, with lighter yearling heifers in the greatest percentage shared the greatest numbers in the sale. Feeder steers and heifers were also very well supplied, as were the cows, which included some high yielding types. Heavy steers and light bullocks were in fair numbers as were the heavier export heifers.

The price increases in most descriptions of cattle continued along with reports of some handy rainfalls across many parts of the North. Light vealers under 200kg sold to a dearer trend together with some of the lightest of the yearling heifers. The trade weight yearling heifers sold at firm prices. The export weight feeder steers sold at similar prices to the previous sale while the lighter domestic feeder steers and heifers sold to a dearer trend under a very strong demand. Restocker yearling steers were in very light supply and demand for them continues to be very strong.

Demand for all slaughter steers and bullocks was again intensified by the smaller supply and the prices rose accordingly. The greatest demand in the market was for the better yielding cows, which lifted in price by 6c to 7c/kg. The lighter and plainer cows that were in a smaller supply stayed at much the same rates as last sale. Heavy export heifers again met a very strong enquiry to record slightly higher prices. 

The top sale price at 273.2c/kg was paid for light weight heifer vealers."
"Numbers nearly halved for a yarding of 345 head. Young cattle made up the largest percentage of the yarding. Quality of the young cattle was mainly plain condition, however there were a fair number of well bred cattle through the sale. All the young cattle went to restockers and feeders at very strong prices.

Very light weaner calves sold to a top of 444.2c, while weaner steers were up to 20c dearer topping at 422c/kg. Restocker weaner heifers gained 10c selling to a top of 358c/kg. Feeder steers topped at 392c and restocker yearling heifers sold to 348c/kg.

There was only a few grown cattle offered, grown steers sold to 310c and heifers sold to 302c/kg. Medium and heavy cows ranged from 240c to 258c/kg."
"Numbers more than halved. The quality and condition was mostly very plain with odd better pens available. The usual processors were in attendance, however there were very few suitable cattle for them. Restockers were active, while there was limited feedlot competition, again, very few to suit.

The quality and condition of the young cattle played a major role in price change through the young cattle. Trends were generally cheaper, however there were odd dearer sales where breed and the quality stood apart. Young calves to restockers in smaller numbers this week sold to a much cheaper trend. The quality of those calves was also below the previous sale. Yearling steers to restockers predominately fell into the light weight classes. Market trends were generally cheaper with some very plain quality and condition lots penned. There were very few good quality feeder steers, these sold strongly by comparison with no comparable sales from last week. Trends were similar through the yearling heifers. A small number of good quality heifers forward in condition sold strongly.

The plainer quality grown heifers showed sufficient frame to feed sold to dearer trends. Processors were active on the limited supply of well finished heifers, the trend also slightly dearer. There was good competition from restockers for the plain condition cows with the market trend dearer. Well finished cows attracted stronger competition from processors with the market trend also showing strong gains. A mostly plain quality penning of bulls attracted strong competition to sell to a much dearer trend."
"Numbers more than doubled, with the inclusion of large numbers of young cattle. Female cattle made up the bulk of the penning, particularly light weight yearling heifers. There were some very good heavy cows and a few well finished medium weight heifer yearlings. The quality of the steers on offer was fair to good, showing a great range in age and weight. The usual export processors were in operation however there were limited supplies of well finished young trade cattle. There was increased restocker and feedlot competition, attracted by the increased numbers and large lines available.

There were varying trends in the market for yearling steers with heavy feeders firm to 5c/kg dearer including some quality variation. The light weight restocker steers saw 280-330kg steers sell to a cheaper trend, with quality also a factor. Very light steers, representing a lower dollar value, sold to a dearer trend with breed a contributing factor in much of the price improvement. Light weight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, with the quality of the offering lifting some prices by as much as 30c/kg. Averages improved by 16c to 20c/kg. Medium weight heifers to restockers sold to a dearer trend of 8c to 12c/kg.

The quality of the grown steers was mixed, with a number of older lots in the manufacturing class. Taking quality into account there was little change in the market trend. Quality was the major factor in the fall in prices for plain condition cows, while the market for well finished heavy weight cows remained firm."
"Numbers more than doubled with light weight young cattle in plain condition making up the bulk of the penning. There were a small number of well finished yearling steers off crop and some very good heavy cows. On average the quality of the offering improved, although not by much. The increased numbers also brought about an increase in processor competition.

There were not many market comparisons available due to the very low numbers last week, however plain condition light weight steers met keen demand from restockers with the market trend 20c/kg dearer, and more in places. No comparisons for medium and heavy yearling steers. That was also the case for yearling heifers, however competition from restockers was once again very strong for light weights.

The small number of well finished cows sold strongly with the extra competition pushing prices to levels seen at other recent sales. The heavy bull market was dearer, also the result of extra processor competition."
"Numbers more than doubled with all categories represented. The quality of the offering was fair to good. There was a good percentage of the offering carrying strong condition. The increased supply brought with it a larger gallery of buyers.

Strong demand from restockers saw the vealer steers to the paddock sell to a dearer trend. The medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed averaged cheaper for quality. The market trend however was firm to dearer. The trends through the yearling heifers were also dearer with increased supply bringing some quality related price change.

Heavy weight grown steers were in reasonable supply with the majority going to feed. No market comparison available. The increased processor competition resulted in dearer trends for the well finished grown heifers. This trend carried through to the cow and bull markets with both categories showing significant improvement.

Market reporter, James Armitage"
"Numbers more than doubled in the fortnight. It was a very mixed quality penning, with condition on the plain side for the most part. There were a few better condition young cattle off crop. The increased numbers brought a larger gallery of buyers, which created increased competition.

Market trends through the young cattle were dearer than the sale 2 weeks ago, with restockers showing confidence. They were active on all classes of young cattle. Very plain condition light weight vealer steers returning to the paddock were met with high demand. Light and medium weight yearling steers saw improvements of as much as 15c/kg, under the increased competition. Lightly muscled yearling heifers also sold to a dearer trend, with a large range in quality accounting for the large price range.

There were no well finished grown steers to quote. The limited supplies of well finished grown heifers suitable to processors sold firm to slightly dearer. There was good improvement in the cow market with increased processor competition. Very plain condition light weight cows were hard to sell, while the medium weight 2 score cows improved by an average of 15c/kg. Well finished heavy weight cows saw a dearer trend of as much as 14c/kg. Heavy bulls attracted greater demand and strong competition, making a dearer trend of as much as 25c/kg."
"Numbers more than doubled in the fortnight since the last sale. Most categories represented with vealers and yearling showing strong increases. The quality of the offering was fair to good as was the condition. There was reduced processor attendance, however the sale was well supported by restockers and feedlots.

Trends varied through the young cattle with vealers attracting strong demand from restockers. This resulted in dearer trends for both steers and heifers. There was some quality related price change in the steers. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to cheaper trends with breed variation accounting for some of the negative price change. Strong demand saw yearling heifers to restock and feed sell to dearer trends. There was little processor activity.

Reduced processor competition for heavy weight grown cattle. The well finished grown steers sold to cheaper trends. The better quality grown heifers also sold to a cheaper trend, the plainer quality D muscles showing a better degree of finish were dearer. Cows and bulls sold to cheaper trends under reduced processor competition. There was a new restocker order operating on some of the medium and heavy weight bulls.

Market reporter; James Armitage."
"Numbers lifted but supply was fairly normal for the beginning of the spring sales. Quality was mixed with well finished trade cattle in short supply. Most of the young cattle sold to restocker and feeder buyers.

Most of the trade cattle sold firm to cheaper while the better bred feeder and restocker steers sold to a slightly dearer trend. The softer prices experienced by most of the trade cattle was driven by a lack of condition.

Export cattle were better supplied with a couple of well finished pens of grown steers and heifers available. The heifer portion enjoyed a good price gain. The better finished steers also sold to a stronger market due to the better finish, while the plainer grades struggled. The cow market was mainly unchanged."
"Numbers increases in a surprising move considering the handy follow up rainfall that was experienced in parts of the area. Quality cattle either from a fat or from a breed point, were very scarce, and cows, weaners and light conditioned yearlings made up most of the yarding. There were no bullocks available, and quality trade cattle and vealers were again very short supplied. 

The trend in the market was firm or cheaper with the usual buyers in attendance. The better bred steer weaners bought by restockers were fully firm, as were the few trade cattle available. But plain steer weaners, heifer weaners and light conditioned yearlings were cheaper by 5c to 7c/kg under a lesser demand.

There were no bullocks to quote other than just a few D muscle steers. Light manufacturing cows were in lesser demand and sold to a slightly cheaper price, while the better yielding types were fully firm. Feeder steers were marginally cheaper but their quality was well down on the last sale. The good numbers of heifers to feed on sold at firm rates as did the bulls.

The top sale price was 224c/kg paid by a restocker for a pen of lightweight steer weaners."
"Numbers increased, with young cattle well supplied. The quality of the offering was fairly plain, with most showing the effects of a cold winter and limited feed stocks. There were some cattle yarded that had had access to oats crops. The usual processors were in attendance and there was increased competition from restockers, particularly on light weight cattle.

Taking quality into account, vealers and yearlings to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend. Steers were up 4c to 6c/kg and more in places. There were strong price gains for yearling heifers to both the trade and feedlot buyers.

There were insufficient heavy grown steers to quote. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. The cow market was mostly firm to slightly cheaper. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"Numbers increased, with the offering comprising of a good supply of vealers and weaners as well as a fair number of cows. There were some good heavy grown steers also. The quality of the offering was very mixed throughout all categories. The usual processors were in attendance and there was extra feedlot competition. 

The majority of the steer vealers fell into the light and medium weight categories and attracted solid restocker competition. The market trend was firm to slightly dearer. Heifer weaners to restock sold to a dearer trend, up to 7c/kg, with breed a factor. There was a number of pens of well finished heifer vealers suitable to the trade, with the market showing a dearer trend, averaging 7c/kg higher. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, up 6c to 10c/kg and more in places. There were varying trends in the heifer yearlings, with increased feedlot activity. Lightweights to restockers sold to a cheaper trend while there was no feedlot activity at the previous sale to make a comparison.

Grown steers to restock and feed were substantially dearer, with breed and quality contributing. Well finished heavy steers to process were also much dearer. The cow market was firm to 6c/kg cheaper."
"Numbers increased, with the offering comprising larger supplies of vealers, yearlings and cows. There was a limited supply of well finished heavy grown steers and heifers with the overall quality in those classes generally plain. The quality of the young cattle was mixed, with condition fair to good while there were some very good cows penned. The usual buyers were in attendance.

There were varying trends through the young cattle. Restocker demand was very high for light weight vealers and yearlings. Vealer steers sold to a significantly dearer trend, with the yard price record for cents per kilogram being broken 7 days after it had been set. Heifer vealers sold to a dearer trend, up to 17c/kg, with competition from restockers stronger. Secondary quality yearlings sold to a dearer trend, while the better quality cattle varied. There were quality related price changes in the light yearling steers to restockers. The better quality medium and heavy yearling steers to feed sold to a cheaper trend, while those to restockers attracted increased competition to sell firm to 6c/kg dearer. Trends were similar through the yearling heifers where secondary quality lines to restockers were dearer and the better quality lots to feed were up to 9c/kg cheaper.

There were no good quality heavy steers to quote. Grown steers to feed saw the plainer quality lots sell to a dearer trend. The cow market was generally firm to 5c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend of 1c to 3c/kg."
"Numbers increased, with fair supplies of vealers, yearlings and cows. The overall quality of the penning was mixed, with limited numbers of straight lines. There was increased export processor and domestic feedlot competition while there was reduced export feeder activity. Restockers were also active.

There were varying market trends, with vealer steers to restock selling to a cheaper trend, averaging 4c to 25c/kg, with the good quality heavier weights least affected. Light heifer vealers to restock sold to a dearer trend, showing significant price increase. The medium and heavy weights sold to a cheaper trend. Light weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a slightly dearer trend. Despite the increased domestic feeder competition medium and heavy weight yearling steers sold to a cheaper trend of 1c to 4c/kg. The increased competition saw yearling heifers sell to a dearer trend, with buyers looking to finish cattle quicker. Medium and heavy 2 and 3 score heifers showed strong price gains, upwards of 25c/kg in places.

The increased export processor competition saw well finished grown steers and heifers sell to a dearer trend of 2c to 8c/kg. It was a strong cow market through all classes, with the increased competition contributing to the dearer market trend of 2c to 10c/kg. Heavy bulls remained firm."
"Numbers increased, with a good supply of well finished cattle available. Young cattle were in good numbers and there were plenty of cows. The regular buyers were in attendance and competition was strong. Overall the quality of the offering was fair to good but showed improvement.

Demand from restockers was keen for vealer steers and the lightweight yearling steers which included weaned steers. The market trend was dearer, up 5c to 8c/kg and more for the younger end of the lightweight yearlings. Quality also accounted for some of the increase. A small number of very fresh heavy trade vealers were penned and sold very well. Heifer vealers followed a similar trend to the steer portion. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed remained firm. Yearling heifers were firm to 3c/kg dearer.

There were a few well finished heavy steers penned and they sold to a dearer trend, up to 7c/kg dearer. A very good quality offering of well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, showing a similar increase to that of the heavy steers. There was a good supply of cows suitable for restocking purposes including lines of PTIC cows. These sold to a dearer trend. Cows to slaughter remained firm to slightly dearer."
"Numbers increased, whilst the overall quality of the yarding was very mixed. There were some very good cows and heavy steers; however the quality of the yearlings were very mixed. There was a restricted processor presence with several absent. This was also the case with some restocker orders, although there was a re-introduction of one order not seen for some time.

The market for young cattle showed variable trends. Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend, up 7c to 8c/kg. The medium and heavy yearling steers suffered from both a drop in quality and competition to sell to a cheaper trend. Lightweight yearling heifers varied also with those to processors cheaper, down 5c/kg. Restockers were active on a better quality offering at firm prices.

The quality of the heavy steers was very good with nothing from the previous week to make a comparison to. Prices were quite a bit cheaper than seen over previous weeks. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend, down 12c to 14c/kg. The cow market also saw a cheaper trend, down 6c to 11c/kg. The highs of the previous bull market were not sustained."
"Numbers increased with young cattle and cows well supplied. There were a few more heavy grown steers with a grain assist penned. There was an extra export processor in the market, along with the regular buyers, while restocker activity increased. Rain forecasted boosted confidence, however not enough to stem the flow of calves split from cows. Overall the quality offered was fair to good with increased supplies of well-finished lots available in most categories.

The increased competition from restockers saw light and medium weight yearling steers sell to a dearer trend, up 3c to 10c/kg, the exception being the very plain condition lightweights. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed attracted more interest and also sold to a dearer trend. There were odd exceptions where heifers did not carry enough weight for some orders. The lean lightweights to processors sold to a cheaper trend, however the well-finished trade heifers were dearer, particularly those heavier weights attracting competition from export processors with domestic orders also.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend, with the extra competition and a vast improvement in quality showing an average price increase of 16c/kg. Well-finished grown heifers also saw benefit from the extra competition to sell to a dearer trend. There were strong gains in the market for plain condition cows with increased demand from restockers. Processor demand also increased for the heavy cows with the market trend firm to 3c/kg dearer, with some quality related price change evident. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"Numbers increased with the penning comprising a mixed quality offering of weaners and yearlings alongside some very good quality, well finished cows.  There was an extra processor operating in the grown cattle section, while the usual restocker and feedlot buyers were in attendance. 

A variable market through the young cattle, with competition strong in some categories and much weaker in others. This created a market of varying trends. Steer weaners to restockers were up to 35c cheaper, however the heifer portion sold to a dearer trend, up to 8c/kg. Medium weight yearling steers to feed sold to a dearer trend, while a reasonably good quality penning of heavy feeders were cheaper. Well finished heavy weight yearlings to the trade also sold to a dearer trend. Plain quality light weight yearling heifers to restock sold to a dearer trend while the better quality light weights displaying a little more weight were cheaper.

Too few heavy grown steers to process to quote a trend. Plain condition cows sold to a cheaper trend with restockers not competing as strongly. The well finished cows were slightly dearer with an improvement in quality a factor in some price increase."
"Numbers increased with the inclusion of some bigger lines. Yearlings, grown heifers and cows were well represented along with another sell off of young calves. Overall, the quality of the offering showed improvement, however the condition for the most part was on the lower end of the scale. There was increased restocker and feedlot competition in attendance alongside the regular processors.

Demand was strong from restockers through the young cattle, with very few suitable to the trade. The young calves sold to a dearer trend of as much as 40c/kg with restockers competing strongly on both the steers and heifers. In some cases there was not a lot of price differential between the males and females. Breed and quality as well as the opportunity to put straight lines together, were contributing factors in significant price improvements for light weight yearling steers. Increased demand and competition were the driving forces in dearer trends. Similar weight yearling heifers sold to a much dearer trend, however the plainest of these struggled to attract much competition. The heifers over 280kg sold on a firm to dearer trend, up to 12c/kg in places.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend of as much as 15c/kg as processors competed strongly for condition. The well finished grown heifers were cheaper with the quality not as good. There were quite a few large framed grown heifers presented in light condition. These attracted strong competition from an increased panel of restockers and feeders, resulting in some very strong price gains, particularly the plainest condition lots. It was very strong cow market with dearer trends resulting. The best of the cows not quite as good as the best of the previous sale. Bulls sold to dearer trends."
"Numbers increased with the inclusion of quite a few plain quality cattle. All categories were represented, however there was a reduced penning of vealers as producers begin to target the upcoming weaner sales as a marketing option. Overall the quality of the offering was quite mixed and in some cases plainer. The usual orders were in attendance with market trends generally cheaper.

Vealer steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 6c/kg with the heavier weights attracting both feedlot and restocker competition. Heifer vealers also sold to a cheaper trend with a small number of very good quality lots suitable to the trade. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend, with quality variations contributing to some significant price reductions. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed followed a similar trend and once again there were quality related price changes of significant note.

Grown steers to feed sold to a cheaper trend, with the overall quality varying greatly. The higher weight for age feeders sold quite well, however the secondary cattle saw large discounts. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend. The cow market was firm to 5c/kg dearer for those to process. Restockers were active on medium to large frame cows in store condition with that market showing greater increases."
"Numbers increased with the inclusion of a large supply of lightweight yearlings more suited for restocking purposes. There were very few grown cattle penned and not all regular processors were in attendance. The rapidly improving seasonal conditions saw restocker activity high with demand very strong.

There were a small number of late vealers penned with the steers to restock selling to a dearer trend. The heifer portion to restock sold slightly cheaper with this quality related. Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend, up 9c while medium weights were 2c/kg dearer. Light weight heifer yearlings to restock experienced a dearer trend, up 4c/kg with an improvement in quality adding to the increase in price. Lightweight heifers to processors sold as much as 16c/kg dearer. Well finished lightweight trade cattle remained firm with quality variations.

There were too few heavy steers to quote a market trend while the heavy cows sold to a cheaper trend under restricted competition."
"Numbers increased with no sale for a fortnight and a few light frosts helping producers with their decision making. The condition of the offering was fair to good while the quality was variable. All regular buyers were in attendance.

Two weeks is a long time with a rising dollar value and heading into winter, the market showing a much cheaper trend throughout all grades.

The bulk of the offering was made up of young cattle with increasing numbers of vealers and weaners penned. The restocker interest in the weaners and yearlings was weaker resulting in a cheaper trend of 15c to 20c/kg and more in places. Trade cattle followed a similar trend, down 6c to 20c/kg.

There were no heavy steers to speak of, therefore a reliable quote is not available. The cow market felt the full effect of a two week break. Medium weight grades were 5c to 16c cheaper with the heavy grades 7c to 18c/kg down."
"Numbers increased with no follow up rain and the first frost just around the corner. Vealers, yearlings and cows were well supplied and there were a few more grown heifers, pregnancy tested empty. The quality of the offering was very mixed and well finished young cattle were scarce. The usual buyers were in attendance however, the extra processors from the previous sale did not operate. Restocker and feedlot buyers were active throughout. 

Market trends varied through the steer vealers with light and heavy weights selling to a slightly dearer trend of 2c to 8c/kg. The light weights representing a low dollar outlay to restockers and the heavier weights attracting feeder competition. The medium weight steers sold to a cheaper trend, too light to feed, but still representing quite an outlay for restockers with little feed going forward. Heifer vealers sold to a dearer trend to both processor and further finishing orders, up 3c to 9c/kg. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed saw a mostly firm market trend. A much improved quality penning of yearling heifers to feed saw prices improve significantly. Well finished heifers to the trade also sold to a dearer trend.

Heavy grown steers to process in limited numbers sold to a dearer trend. The majority of the grown heifers were lightly muscled with the market trend dearer for all classes. The cow market was also dearer, improving by 8c to 15c/kg and more in places."
"Numbers increased with more brought forward by the higher prices. Young cattle were well supplied and there was an increase in cow and bull numbers. The quality of the offering was very mixed. There were a few well finished yearlings and cows, however most of the yarding carried little weight or condition. An extra processor returned and there was very good local restocker activity.

There were dearer trends throughout the sale. Vealer steers to restockers saw significant price gains, especially if they were Angus. Heifer vealers to restock followed a similar trend. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock improved 8c to 30c/kg with the largest increase in the medium weights. There were strong gains through all classes of yearling heifers, with restockers showing little regard for quality or weight.

Heavy grown heifers were firm to slightly dearer. The well finished heavy cows were up to 3c/kg dearer with limited numbers available. Restockers competed strongly, while processors were active on the plain condition cows with the market showing some of the largest price gains of the day. Heavy bulls in larger numbers were as much as 13c/kg dearer."
"Numbers increased with greater supplies of vealers, yearlings and cows yarded. The quality, both from a breed and breeding perspective varied greatly, particularly noticeable throughout the young cattle. Condition was mixed throughout also. The regular buyers were in place along with an increased restocker presence.

Demand from restockers increased, however breed quality was a significant factor in prices received. Steer vealers to restock sold to a dearer trend, however there was little to compare to from the previous sale. Heifer vealers bought by processors remained close to firm with little but quality related variations in price. Breed quality was a major factor in the cheaper prices seen for yearling steers to restock and feed, the trend however was firm to dearer. This carried through to some of the heifer yearlings also, while the more attractive breeds were up to 9c/kg dearer. The well finished trade heifers were generally firm.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend, up to 5c/kg. The better quality grown heifers also sold to a dearer trend. The cow market saw a little variation, mostly quality related through the medium weights. The trend for medium weights was firm to 2c dearer, while the heavy cows were up to 4c/kg dearer."
"Numbers increased with a good selection of vealers and cows offered. There was a fair supply of yearlings, while the numbers of grown steers and heifers was down. The quality of the offering was mostly good however there was a large variation in breed quality that impacted prices in some classes. Well finished cattle suitable for processing were in fair numbers. The regular buyers were in attendance however there was a little less feedlot competition on specific breeds.

Market trends varied through the young cattle. Lighter weight vealer steers to restock sold to a slightly cheaper trend. The heavier steers sold a little dearer as buyers looked to carry more weight going into the colder months. Heifer vealers to restock attracted increased competition to sell to a dearer trend, of up to 9c/kg. Well finished trade vealers saw a greater price improvement with quality also better. There was little change in the market for medium weight yearling steers to feed on, while the heavy feeder steers saw prices cheaper due to less competition and breed variations. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed attracted increased competition, to sell to a dearer trend of up to 18c/kg in places.

Well finished grown steers and heifers attracted stronger demand from processors, with both categories selling to a dearer trend. There were breed, quality and competition factors impacting the cheaper prices for grown steers to feed. Demand was also high for cows from both restockers and processors. The market trend was dearer with well finished heavy weights improving by 10c and medium weight 2 scores increasing by as much as 15c/kg."
"Numbers increased this week with a larger number of vealers penned and the usual buyers present. Majority of those cattle purchased going to restockers and feedlotters. There were limited supplies of yearlings, grown cattle and just over 100 head of cows. The quality of the vealers was generally good with well-bred lines comprising the bulk. There were a small number of vealers and yearlings good enough to suit trade buyers. There was also great variation in quality through the cows.

Restocker and feeder buyers were active through the young cattle. The quality of vealer steers to restock contributed to increased prices on a dearer market trend. Differences in both breed and quality played a role in price variability. Medium weights were as much as 21c/kg dearer in places, while the heavier weights were only slightly dearer. Heifer vealers to all markets sold to cheaper trends of 10c to 20c/kg, with some improved quality lines making less than the best from the previous week. The market trend was 10c to 20c/kg cheaper. Limited supplies of medium and heavy weight yearling feeder steers sold to cheaper trends. Well finished trade heifer yearlings sold to a dearer trend of 8c to 9c/kg.

There were insufficient grown steers or heifers to quote. Once again, the cow market showed improvement. There were strong gains throughout, most noticeable being plainer types and medium weight cows. The best of the heavy weights were dearer by 7c/kg. Overall, the average quality of the cows improved, resulting in those much higher averages. The best of the heavy bulls also sold to a dearer trend."
"Numbers increased slightly to see cows in the majority, as well as an increase in early weaned calves, due of course to the deteriorating conditions in the marketing area. The balance of the penning consisted predominately of plainer conditioned young cattle, with the exception of isolated, better presented pens of yearlings. All the regular buyers attended.

Early weaned steer and heifer calves sold to restockers in very good order. Light restocker steers saw a slight rise in trends, however, in the main draw, yearling types saw cheaper trends, according to a lack of condition of 28c/kg. Light heifers to the restockers saw a dearer trend for the most part, up 29c/kg, while heavy feeder heifers experienced a slightly dearer trend.

Grown heifers to feed sold to a slightly dearer trend of 4c/kg. Feeder demand was competitive on light and medium weight cows, while medium weight D2 and D3 cows eased 7 to 16c/kg. Heavy D2 cows sold to dearer trends of 8c/kg, with the heavy D3 cows experiencing a slight reduction."
"Numbers increased significantly with the inclusion of approximately 400 very good quality EU accredited store yearling cattle. All grades had a better representation with condition and quality ranging from fair to good. There were some very good crop finished yearlings, a few heavyweight steers and some good runs of cows. All regular processor orders were in place and plenty of restocker activity.

The market showed a firm to dearer trend through most grades. Restocker weaner steers sold to a dearer trend, up 8c to 20c/kg. Yearling steers also sold to a dearer trend, up to 9c/kg dearer with most of the EU steers remaining in the system. The heifer yearlings to restock and feed also sold to a dearer trend, up 10c to 13c/kg this quote taking a quality improvement into account. Trade cattle also sold firm to dearer with lightweight heifer vealers and yearlings 10c to 12c/kg up. The medium and heavyweight heifer yearlings were firm to 6c/kg dearer. Limited numbers of yearling steers went to the trade.

Heavyweight steers and bullocks sold firm. Grown heifers with 2 or more teeth sold to a dearer trend with a substantial increase in numbers and quality. The cow market saw a dearer trend through all grades with the quality and condition quite varied."
"Numbers increased significantly and the quality and condition of the overall yarding was fair to good. Vealers were well supplied and there was a fair supply of cows and grown steers, although there were not a lot of heavy weights yarded. All regular buyers were in attendance and there was a larger gallery of restocker orders.

The market for steer vealers to restock responded to the increased competition with a dearer trend, up 15c/kg. The heifer vealers to restockers and processors couldn't sustain the rates of the previous sale and sold to a cheaper trend, down 6c/kg. The limited supply of well finished 3 score vealers remained firm. In the mixed quality yarding of yearling steers, the heavyweight portion to restockers and feeders sold firm to 6c/kg dearer, while quality was the major contributing factor to any price variation in the light and medium weight categories. Yearling heifers to both feed and process remained largely firm, with most variations quality related.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend, with premiums of 10c/kg for the milk and 2 tooth lots. Steers with 2 or more teeth to feed remained firm. The cow market was strong, with medium weights remaining firm and the best of the heavyweights 2c to 4c/kg dearer."
"Numbers increased sharply with the commencement of a new financial year. Tradition continued with an influx of vealers, held over to July. Cows were well supplied and there was representation in most other categories. The quality and condition of the offering was mixed. Some of the young cattle showing the effects of Winter. The same processors operated and there was very strong restocker activity.

Demand was very high through the young cattle resulting in dearer trends. Vealer steers to restock experienced significant improvement in all weight classes. That trend carried into the heifer portion also. Strong feedlot demand saw heavy weight yearling steers sell very well, however there was nothing from the previous sale to make a market comparison. Heavy heifer yearlings followed a similar trend.

High processor demand for well finished heavy cattle saw grown steers post strong gains. Well finished grown heifers attracted both feedlot and processor competition to sell much dearer. A very good quality penning of heavy weight cows met keen demand to sell to a dearer trend of as much as 14c/kg. Heavy weight bulls were up to 10c/kg dearer.

Market reporter, James Armitage."
"Numbers increased sharply as the country dries out after the good rain and a portion of the bigger yarding was also attributed to the sharp increase in values following the rain. Quality was much improved on most descriptions with recent higher prices drawing more bullocks and cows into the market. Light vealers and restocker yearlings were in lower numbers while feeder cattle were well supplied.

A full field of buyers of young cattle attended and most descriptions sold at dearer rates. Light vealers were firm but domestic feeder steers and restocker steers were dearer under keen demand. Trade and feeder yearling heifers also improved in value.

One leading buyer of Jap Ox and export weight heifers did not operate, but values for suitable bullocks rose by 5c to 6c/kg. Cows met another strong enquiry to increase in value by up to 6c/kg. Most export heifers were firm but a few pens of heavier types were marginally cheaper. The bull market remained fully firm.  

Top sale price was 235.2c/kg paid for light vealer calves to slaughter."
"Numbers increased quite a few in what was a plain condition offering of fair to good quality cattle. Restockers were active in a small gallery of buyers. Most grades were represented however young cattle dominated the offering.

There were some variations in trends through the young cattle. Vealer steers and yearling steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend. A mixed quality offering of heifer vealers sold cheaper as did the lightweight yearling heifers. Those to the trade sold from 8c to 10c/kg cheaper.

There were to few heavyweight steers to quote, while grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend. There were a lot more cows penned on the previous weeks sale, however the lack of cows last week meant there was nothing to compare a market trend to. There were also increase numbers of bulls that sold to a cheaper trend to the processors while a few went to restockers."
"Numbers increased over half to see a large offering of feeder steers and heifers, with quite a few mixed quality cattle to suit opportunity restockers. The cow penning improved to see a number of heavy cows, some tending to extended fat cover. The usual processors were present as well as feeder buyers looking to heifers with weight and fat cover.

Weaners did not measure up to last sale's values, so saw a cheaper trend for both categories, with all to restockers. A lack of quality through drafts of the light yearling steers saw restockers operating to cheaper trends. Medium weight feeders responded to better efforts of feeder buyers to be 20c/kg dearer. Similar competition through the medium backgrounders, also dearer. Drafts of very heavy yearlings in the feeder category saw those cattle sell to cheaper trends, with a reduced average. Again a lack of supply in the light heifer section contributed to a cheaper trend. The better bred medium weights sold to strong trends.

Heavy grown steers to process sold to significantly stronger trends, the heifer portion also dearer. Cow trends varied to see well finished heavy weights sell to 8c/kg better. A draft of PTIC cows went to the restocker market. Heavy bulls sold to much dearer trends.

Market Reporter, Stephen Adams."
"Numbers increased only slightly in a yarding consisting mainly of weaner cattle. There was a few good vealers and yearling heifers penned, however, there was only an odd grown steer and heifer and a small penning of cows.

Overall quality in the young cattle section was plain with the exception of an odd prime vealer and a few pens of crop finished yearling heifers.  Light weaner restocker steers met strong competition, while the vealer heifers were 8c/kg dearer.  Restockers and feeders competed strongly on the yearling steers although the average price was lower, mainly due to the plainer condition of some lines of steers.  Despite this, the well bred steers continued to attract keen demand.  

The yarding of yearling heifers consisted of some very well finished heifers, which attracted strong demand from processors resulting in a price rise of 20c/kg.  Grown steers and heifers were in limited numbers and sold at strong rates.  There were a few pens of heavy high yielding cows that sold to 9c/kg dearer, while the plainer grades held firm.

Well-bred restocker weaner steers toped the sale at 235.2c/kg."
"Numbers increased once again, with cows and their progeny being offloaded in greater numbers. Feed and more importantly water concerns taking hold of the decision making process. All other categories were represented, except for well finished heavy grown steers. The quality and condition of the offering was mixed. The regular buyers attended, along with a couple of extra processors.

Market trends varied through the young cattle. The good quality vealer steers to restockers sold on a firm to slightly cheaper market trend, quality variations accounting for some greater price change. The heifer vealers to restockers and trade orders also sold to cheaper trends, with some of the light weights significantly so. A primarily plain quality penning of yearling steers sold to cheaper trends. There were odd sales of very well bred steers out of condition that sold strongly. There were also cheaper trends through the yearling heifers, where there was reduced restocker competition on the better quality lots. The secondary and plain quality heifers saw limited competition and demand. This resulted in substantial price reductions.

The few well finished heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, however there was a reduction in quality. Well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. The cow market saw trends firm to 5c/kg dearer, with the extra processor competition a factor. In a reflection of seasonal conditions, there were large numbers of cows that would normally be retained penned. The heavy bull market was dearer, although in some classes the quality was not as good."
"Numbers increased once again with vealers and yearlings well supplied along with a fair penning of cows. Overall the quality was very mixed. There were quite a few secondary quality cattle showing low weight for age. Not all of the regular buyers were in attendance, however one feeder returned and a new feedlot order participated. Market trends varied throughout.

Vealer steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 12c/kg with quality variations adding to average price falls. There was little but quality related change in the market for heifer vealers despite there being less processor competition. Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend as restockers changed their preference to the weaner cattle. Medium weight yearling steers to feed saw benefit from increased competition to sell to a dearer trend, while heavy feeders sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Secondary quality lightweight heifer yearlings showing poor weight for age sold to a cheaper trend. Heifers over 280kg to restock and feed saw a firm to dearer trend with increased restocker and feedlot demand.

There were too few heavy grown steers sold to processors to quote. Grown heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend. In the cow market restockers were active on medium weight 2 and 3 score cows with the market trend firm to slightly dearer. Heavy cows also sold to a dearer trend."
"Numbers increased once again in an offering that saw all grades represented. Overall the quality of the offering was good, although there were still a few plain cattle offered. All regular slaughter and feedlot orders were in place and there was some good restocker demand.

The quality and weight of the vealer steers improved and this was an attraction to buyers. The medium and heavyweight vealer steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend, up 8c to 13c/kg. The light steer vealers sold firm to a shade cheaper for quality. Heifer vealers to the trade were fully firm although quality did show up some variation. A new restocker order saw suitable lines sell to a dearer trend. Yearling cattle to restock and feed were well sought. Light and medium weight yearling steers sold to a dearer trend, up 7c to 20c while heavyweights to feed were firm to 5c/kg dearer. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed met very strong competition to sell 8c to 15c dearer and more on an odd lot. Trade yearling heifers sold firm to 4c/kg dearer.

There were some very good young heavy grown steers penned with the market firm to 3c/kg dearer. Grown heifers experienced little change. 

The cow market showed some variation with very lightweight restocker cows selling much dearer. Overall the plainer condition cows averaged 2c/kg dearer. Medium weight 3 and 4 score cows remained firm while the heavy cows sold firm to 3c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls were firm to 3c/kg dearer also."
"Numbers increased once again despite the improved seasonal conditions. The quality of the offering was mixed although the condition was fair to good. There were increased feeder orders amongst both yearlings and older heifers. A lot of heifers bought by processors over the past few weeks found themselves going to feeder buyers.

Restockers were still active on yearling steers. Light steers remained firm while the medium weights with some quality issues sold firm to slightly cheaper. There were very few heifer yearlings that did not either go back to the paddock or onto feed. The feeder heifers sold at rates firm to 2c/kg dearer. The restocker heifer yearlings also suffered a drop in quality although overall their market remained firm. The limited number of heifers that went to the trade did so at slightly cheaper rates.

There were limited numbers of grown steers penned, they sold to an unchanged market. Grown heifers with 2 or more teeth purchased by feeder orders remained firm with those going to processors firm to 6c cheaper. The older 4 and 6 teeth heifers suffered the most. Medium and heavy well finished cows sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 5c/kg. Restockers were active on plainer conditioned cows, the market firm to a shade dearer. Bulls sold to a cheaper trend although the very best heavy bulls maintained their value."
"Numbers increased marginally but quality was only fair. Prime cattle were in limited numbers but they included some good bullocks, some well finished cows, and a fair supply of yearling heifers. Very light vealers were short supplied as were restocker yearling steers.

The usual field of buyers attended and young cattle values remained fully firm. Trade cattle were in limited supply, particularly three score heifers. Heifer vealers weighing in excess of 200kg met keen competition from both restockers and retailers but values did not alter. Restockers attended in numbers but most were disappointed in the lack of suitable cattle yarded.

Heavy steers and bullocks met a sharp rise in price with the younger bullocks in particular receiving up to 10c/kg in price increases. Heavy export heifers were firm, while most of the better cows recorded a 3c to 5c/kg price increase. Over-conditioned cows in a few sales, sold to 8c/kg dearer. Bull values showed a similar price rise.

Top sale of the day was 239.2c/kg paid by a restocker for light steer vealers."
"Numbers increased in an offering that saw all grades represented. The quality and condition of the offering was fairly mixed. Young cattle once again made up the bulk of the yarding with cows also well represented. Most regular buyers were in attendance.

The market for vealer steers returning to the paddock was dearer for the light and medium weight ranges, up to 5c/kg. The heavy vealer steer grades sold firm to slightly cheaper. Heifer vealers sold to a cheaper trend, although the market did seem to strengthen a little as the sale progressed. Both restockers and processors were active on the 2 score heifers. There were increased numbers of yearling steers penned, the majority not carrying enough condition for the trade. The market for restocker steers remained generally unchanged, while odd pens to the trade were a shade dearer. Heifer yearling numbers saw quite an increase and a fair variation in quality and condition. Under pressure of numbers and slightly weaker demand the market recorded a cheaper trend for the plainer grades while the very best of the heifers to the trade remained firm.

There were some very well finished heavy steers in the offering. Quality and demand saw the market improve by 4c to 8c/kg. Demand for grown heifers also improved realising a dearer trend. There were plenty of cows, once again, with the market showing little change. The most obvious was in the plain light cows, which sold a bit cheaper. The balance sold at rates similar to last week."
"Numbers increased in a yarding where young cattle were dominant. The quality was fair to good with a nice line up of yearling steers and vealers. There were the usual secondary quality cattle through all grades. Heavy export cattle were once again limited in supply. The market through most grades was strong in front of a full field of processors and a large gallery of restockers.

The quality of the vealers was very good with weight also increasing. The market showed a dearer trend, up 2c to 3c/kg. Restockers, buoyed by the improved seasonal conditions competed very strongly on the good quality yearling steers with light and medium weights showing a dearer trend of 10c to 18c/kg. The quality of the offering certainly contributed to some of the price improvement. Heavy weight feeder steers also improved in quality and trend to be 7c to 12c/kg dearer. Light heifer yearlings to process and to restock sold to a slightly cheaper trend with a bit less restocker demand. A small number of 3 scores sold to the trade at dearer rates, up 10c/kg. Medium and heavy 3 scores to the trade were firm to 6c/kg dearer.

The quality of the grown steers was very mixed with a limited supply of well finished heavy steers. The market for the heavy steers improved 5c to 6c/kg. The grown heifer market also showed a dearer trend, up 5c to 9c/kg. Cow numbers improved along with quality. The market saw a dearer trend, up 2c to 7c/kg with the plainer condition cows to process and restock least affected. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend, up 3c to 5c/kg."
"Numbers increased in a yarding that consisted of a good supply of vealer steers and heifers. There was a fair penning of feeder steers and heifers, while there was only a few grown steer and bullocks, while cows were well supplied.

Quality of the young cattle was mixed with some good runs of well-bred vealer steers and heifers and some plain yearlings.  Vealer steers met strong restocker demand to sell 10c/kg dearer and vealer heifers made similar gains.  Feeder steers were up by 4c/kg while restockers also made gains.  Feeder heifers struggled to hold firm.

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows consisting of a good supply of light and medium cows and a few pens of heavy cows, while there was an odd pen of bullocks and steers.  Bullocks and steers held firm, while the cow market was down by 6c to 10c/kg, although light cows were less affected."
"Numbers increased in a yarding comprising of good supplies of young cattle which was mostly yearlings with a few vealers. Cows made up the bulk of the grown cattle. The quality of the yearling feeder cattle was the best seen for some time, showing good condition and solid weight for age, along with good breeding. There were some very good cows although there were limited supplies of well finished grown steers and heifers. The full field of regular buyers were in attendance and there was good restocker activity.

Trends varied through the young cattle with light weight vealer steers to restockers selling to a cheaper trend with breed a factor. The medium and heavy weights sold to a dearer trend. Light weight yearling steers to restock sold to a mainly firm trend with an odd dearer sale brought about by a lift in quality. Medium and heavy yearling steers to feed sold to a dearer trend with the quality of some lots in the heavy weight range lifting prices by as much as 15c to 20c/kg. Light and medium weight yearling heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend, again quality a factor. The heavy yearling heifers showing plenty of condition sold to a cheaper trend, to both the trade and lot feeders. Increased weight and condition was a factor.

The limited supply of heavy steers sold to a cheaper trend while well finished grown heifers were as much as 20c/kg cheaper. Cows sold to a cheaper trend with the leaner cattle least affected off the back of restocker demand. The well finished heavy weight cows were up to 14c/kg cheaper."
"Numbers increased heading into the traditional sell off period. All categories were represented with a good supply of yearling while there were not many vealers penned. The quality of the offering varied from very good quality feeders through to secondary quality grown heifers. Condition also showed quite a variation. There was a similar buying group in attendance.

Demand was weaker through the young cattle with this resulting in cheaper trends throughout. Bearing in mind the fortnightly sales there was significant price change in places.vealer heifers to restock were substantially cheaper while the limited supply of steer vealers lacked the quality of the previous penning. A good supply of medium and heavy weight yearling steers sold to considerably cheaper trends. There was limited competition for medium and heavy weight yearling heifers with a reduction in buying orders.

Heavy grown steers over 500kg to feed and including milk tooth lines experienced little change in trends with some breed related improvement. Heavy weights to process up to 10c/kg cheaper. Secondary quality grown heifers attracted little competition also. The well finished grown heifers sold to a slightly cheaper trend. The better heavy weight cows were up to 7c cheaper. Heavy bulls also sold to a cheaper trend."
"Numbers increased for what was a very mixed quality penning. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering, however there were very few suitable to the trade. There were limited supplies of grown cattle. Processor competition was restricted and there was reduced restocker activity.

Market trends were generally cheaper with quality a factor in some cases. Very light weight yearling steers to restock were 8c/kg cheaper, and more in places, taking quality into account. The better quality medium and heavy weights to restock sold on a firm to 8c/kg market trend. Yearling heifers to restock also sold to a cheaper trend.

No heavy grown steers of grown heifers to quote. The medium weight cows saw a cheaper trend of 1c to 8c/kg with the few heavy weights slightly dearer."
"Numbers increased due to the dry weather, which has growers uncertain about whether to sell or hold. Quality was similar to last sale on all cattle except restocker yearling steers, which were of a lower quality standard. Very few vealers were yarded and there were no bullocks available.

All the usual buyers attended and the market trend for most cattle was firm to dearer. Restocker yearling steers were slightly cheaper with the drop in quality being the reason. Trade heifers sold to a dearer trend under strong competition. Very lightweight yearling and weaner heifers were much dearer with the buying strength coming from wholesalers and not from restockers. Lightweight feeder steers sold at marginally dearer prices. Restocker demand was intense despite the deteriorating season.

No market quote for bullocks is possible. Demand for all cows was stronger and prices averaged 4c/kg dearer across all descriptions. Bulls were heavier muscled than last sale and therefore met increased demand.

A restocker paid the top sale price of 208c/kg for lightweight C2 steer weaners."
"Numbers increased due to the 400 cattle advertised as stores but sold by live weight at the end of the regular market. The quality of the yarding showed little change from last week with plain yearling vealers being in the greatest percentage. Cows were very well supplied but high yielders were short. There were a few bullocks and heavy steers with some being well finished but most were under fattened.

It was another solid market for young stock with increased prices for restocker cattle coming from Southern NSW and VIC buyers. The splitter light vealers sold at firm rates along with the trade yearlings and restocked yearlings.

In export cattle, bullocks and cows sold at a firm price under even enquiry. Cows again met strong and steady demand to be fully firm. 

In the store section of the sale, meat operators and restockers competed for the plain bred and under conditioned PTIC cows with prices dearer than what might have been expected."
"Numbers increased by almost 50%. The offering comprised large numbers of light weight young cattle and cows. The quality was very mixed, while condition was mostly plain. There were limited opportunities for processors to secure well finished cattle. The usual processors attended, along with extra feedlot competition. There were a number of southern restocker orders in place, providing increased competition for the regular orders.

The increased numbers and competition saw market trends for vealer steers to restock firm to dearer, up 12c to 14c/kg and more in places for the better quality lines. Heifer vealers to restock saw the medium weights show little change, while light weights saw a dearer trend. Increased competition, combined with an improvement in quality resulted in medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed, selling to a dearer trend of 30c to 40c/kg. Some of the price increases were breed and quality related. Light weight yearling heifers posted strong gains, with increased competition. Yearling heifers suitable to feed were also much dearer, with some very well bred lines presented. Well finished trade heifers sold to a dearer trend.

The small number of heavy grown steers sold to a slightly cheaper trend, easing 7c/kg. Well finished grown heifers sold firm to slightly cheaper also. The plainer quality grown heifers were affected by breed and quality, which accounted for much of the price change. Very plain condition and low quality cows sold to a much cheaper trend, with restockers showing little interest. The better quality 1 and 2 score cows saw little change in trends, with restockers outbidding processors for the most part. Well finished cows sold to a cheaper trend of as much as 15c/kg. Strong Live export competition resulted in a much dearer market for all classes of bulls."
"Numbers increased by almost 1,000 head as vendors looked to cash in on the very strong market levels. The quality of the offering was fair to very good, comprising a good supply of vealers and yearlings. Grown cattle were also well supplied, however there were few heavy grown steers. Condition also varied with an increase in the supply of well finished young cattle. A full filed of buyers were in attendance along with quite a few restockers.

Demand far outweighed supply through all classes of young cattle. There was increased trade competition on well finished yearlings, while competition from feedlot buyers was very strong. Restockers were active on lightweight vealers and yearlings not deemed suitable to feed. Lightweight steer vealers to restock sold to a dearer trend of 20c/kg. There were increased numbers in the medium weight class with no market comparison available. Heifer vealers were up to 11c/kg dearer. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw light and medium weights sell to a dearer trend of 20c to 30c/kg. Heavy feeders saw price improvements of as much as 34c/kg. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed experienced similar price gains to those of the steers with well finished heifers suitable to the trade experiencing stronger gains. The main focus for both feedlot and trade buyers seemed to be to secure as many cattle as possible with little regard for quality.

Grown steers with 2 or more teeth to feed averaged 31c dearer with some sales as much as 40c/kg dearer. Well finished grown heifers attracted strong processor demand with the younger 2 tooth lots showing price gains of as much as 37c/kg. The cow market also saw a dearer trend with the better medium and heavy weights up to 22c/kg dearer. Strong competition saw the plainer 1 and 2 score cows up to 28c/kg dearer."
"Numbers increased by 50%, which is a normal circumstance at this time. For the first time this summer some well finished yearlings were offered,  an indication that cattle have been slow to fatten through the summer. Overall the quality was very much improved on all descriptions.

The market was weaker for most types, with an odd pen of well done trade cattle remaining firm. Restock yearlings were included in the easier trend.

Cows, heavy steers and bullocks sold to a cheaper market, and the impression gained was that interest was falling away on these types. Against the trend, the heaviest bulls sold at dearer prices."
"Numbers increased by 50% with an influx of yearlings and cows. There was a large offering of yearlings, mostly light weight and medium weights suitable to restock and feed. A feature of the penning was the quality of the cows yarded with a large percentage of C muscles showing high yields.

The market for steers to restock and feed was variable with lightweight vealers much dearer. The lightweight yearling steers sold firm to cheaper, however most of the fall was related to breed quality with British breeds maintaining their value. There was less competition for the medium weight steers and they sold to a cheaper trend, down 8c/kg. The larger offering of yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend with the exception of a few well finished heifers to restock. The market for the lightweight 2 scores was down 7c to 10c/kg. The well finished trade heifers experienced a greater drop with quality a factor.

The heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend with quality and age a contributing factor. The very good quality penning of heavy cows sold firm to 4c/kg dearer although much of the increase in the heavy weights is related to quality and yield. The medium weight cows were also dearer."
"Numbers increased by 290 head with producers off loading cattle despite the very good seasonal conditions being experienced. There was a good representation of cows penned including a line PTIC, purchased by both restockers and processors. All other grades recorded increased numbers also. The quality of the offering was mixed with a greater percentage of the offering showing good finish. All regular processors were in attendance and competing strongly.

The increased numbers of yearling steers brought about a drop in quality, this in turn impacted on average prices although the actual market trend was firm. The trend was the same for the heifer yearlings bought by restockers while odd lots suitable to the trade sold slightly cheaper.

Grown steers over 400kg to restockers remained firm as did the heavyweight steers to processors. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 3c to 7c. The cow market was very strong with all grades showing a dearer trend. Medium weight grades were 2c to 8c dearer while the heavy grades showed improvement by 5c to 6c and more in places for odd single lots. The heavyweight bull market was 2c to 4c dearer."
"Numbers increased by 220 head. The quality of the yarding was only fair with most cattle needing a bit more finish. There were however, some well finished heavy steers and cows penned. All the regular buyers were in attendance, albeit in a more subdued buying mood.

The market trend for all grades was cheaper, the exception being the best of the heavy steers. The young cattle saw a cheaper trend of 4c to 6c/kg throughout, with the quality also putting downward pressure on prices. 

Grown heifers met weaker competition and sold cheaper by 10c to 15c/kg with quite a number penned. The best of the heavy steers sold slightly dearer, up 4c/kg. The balance of the grown steers lacking the quality of last week, met restricted competition and sold up to 8c/kg cheaper.

There were limited numbers of well finished heavy cows offered. The penning consisting mostly of plain light and medium weights. Plain conditioned medium and light cows to both processors and restockers were cheaper, down 10c to 12c/kg. The medium and heavy weight 3 and 4 score cows were cheaper by 4c to 6c/kg and more in places, however the overall quality was not up to last week. Bulls remained firm."
"Numbers increased at the start of the traditional New England autumn selling period. The average quality was well below the last sale, with all descriptions affected, and the numbers of finished stock was reduced. Most of the usual operators attended.

Values for all yearling cattle, with the exception of restock steers, sold at cheaper rates by 2 to 5c/kg. Restock steers sold at firm values.

It was obvious that the wide variation in quality affected the values paid, and created irregular competition.

Export cows, heifers and grown steers met a much less enthusiasm, to sell at values  cheaper by 3 and 4c/kg."
"Numbers increased at Armidale, with a very plain quality, mixed penning of cattle. Included in the yarding were several drafts of cows which were precluded from exporters being able to operate. All buyers attended, and the market saw cheaper trends.

Better quality heifer weaners sold to a dearer trend of 49c/kg. Light yearling steers eased in price, with quality a factor. Medium weight feeder steers sold firm. Poor quality and condition saw yearling heifers attract little competition, resulting in cheaper trends through most categories.


There were no grown steers to report. Grown heifers sold to cheaper trends overall, however an isolated draft of better conditioned heifers saw an increase of 5c/kg. The best light cows to restockers and feeders saw prices improve. Medium weight cows to the trade saw an improvement of 13c, with the better D3 heavy cows increasing by 7c/kg. A plain bull offering saw only 16 bulls penned, which topped at 230c/kg."
"Numbers increased at Armidale this week and so did the quality with the bulk of the yarding cows, light vealers and yearling heifers of mostly light weights. There were basically no grown steers or bullocks, which is very unusual and the cows were a better type and selection than last sale. The usual regular buyers attended the sale with most having to be satisfied with buying small numbers only. The trend in the market was firm to dearer for all types.

There were some top light vealers in the market this week and for the first time vealers weighing 150kg topped the 200 c/kg mark. The variation in price between this and last week is extreme, but the quality of the product was so much better. Light heifer yearlings were in keen demand and sold to 10c/kg dearer in some cases, although the average rise was no more than 2c/kg. Yearling steers to the restocker showed no price change.

There is no heavy steer or bullock quote, but the cows sold very strongly again to register some price rises on all lots. The quality and yield of the cows however, was well above last sale. There were not many bulls available and their quality was average only."
"Numbers increased as the district goes into winter without urgently required rain.  Quality on a number of descriptions was below the usual standard and weaner cattle numbers were well down on recent sales. Weaner cattle varied between very heavy and very lightweights with not many medium weights yarded. Bullocks, feeder steers and cows were in fair numbers in the yarding but yearling cattle were short supplied.

Trends in the market varied fairly widely, with weaners, either steers or heifers, selling at cheaper rates under a lessening demand. Many of the heavier steer weaners carried too much weight for the restocker demand with most buyers preferring to buy the lighter weaners for a lower capital outlay. Yearling heifers were also 3c/kg cheaper while the very few lines of trade or restocker steer yearlings were steady in price.

The bulk of feeder steers were in the heavier weight brackets and a stronger demand saw prices rise by an average 3c/kg.

Demand for bullocks of all ages was steady and values remained little changed. The same situation applied to export heifers and while cow price trends varied, the general result was a slight rise in price. 

The top price was 202.2c/kg paid by a restocker for a pen of very light steer weaners."
"Numbers increased as producers offload prior to the upcoming cold weather. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the numbers with a fair supply of grown heifers. Well finished heavy grown steers were in limited supply with most falling into the manufacturing steer age group. There was a full field of buyers in attendance with a little extra restocker and feedlot competition. Overall the quality of the offering was good and there was a good supply of forward to well finished cattle penned.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with steer vealers to restock selling to a dearer trend, up 5c/kg for medium weight and more for the heavier weights. Breed quality also contributed to a lift in average prices. Heifer vealers to the trade sold to a cheaper trend, down 10c to 12c/kg with those to restockers firm to slightly dearer. Once again breed contributed to a lift in price. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed sold on a mostly firm market trend. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend with a lift in quality.

There was a strong order for well heavy cattle to go onto an oat crop for a couple of months with those purchased by that order showing in the restocker category. Well finished heavy steers and heifers to that order were quite a bit dearer. Heavy manufacturing steers sold to a dearer trend also. The cow market was firm to slightly dearer with some better quality cows penned. Restockers were active on any plain condition cow showing good frame."
"Numbers increased as producers offload coming into the winter months. Vealers were well supplied making up half of the offering. There was a good supply of cows, although yields were generally down. There was a limited supply of heavy steers and a very mixed quality offering of yearlings. All regular buyers were in place and there was the usual amount of restocker activity.

The market for vealer steers to restock was variable, with a small number of very lightweights selling at dearer rates. The medium weights sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 8c/kg. The heavier weights were less affected with odd sales remaining firm. The C2 heifer vealers to the trade and restockers sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 7c/kg. There was a very good quality offering of well finished 3 score heifer vealers and they sold to a dearer trend. Medium weight yearling steers to restock improved in quality, selling at dearer rates as a result. Heifer yearlings to restock sold at dearer rates, as did the few 3 score trade heifers.

There was a limited supply of well finished heavy grown steers available and they sold to a cheaper trend, down 2c/kg. The cow market saw the worst of the market down turn, easing 5c to 14c/kg. Restockers were active on plainer condition cows and those PTIC."
"Numbers increased as producers continue to offload in the leadup to winter. Young cattle were well supplied and there was a large penning of cows. The quality of the offering was very mixed with quite a few secondary quality cattle penned. There were large numbers of plain condition cows. Competition from feedlots was reduced however those in attendance bid strongly on suitable cattle, while there was an extra trade order operating mainly on the well finished heifer vealers.

Restockers were active on steer vealers with the market mostly unchanged apart from some quality variations. Restocker activity was weaker for heifer vealers with these cattle selling to a cheaper trend. The extra trade competition saw well finished 3 score vealers sell to a dearer trend, up 10c to 20c/kg. A very mixed quality penning of lightweight yearling steers saw secondary quality lines sell to a cheaper trend with the better C muscles selling to a dearer trend. Limited numbers of medium and heavy feeders attracted keen demand, especially for Angus steers with the market trend also dearer, up by 16c/kg and more in places. Heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend with a drop in quality contributing.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. The large penning of plain condition cows saw less restocker competition to sell on a firm to cheaper market trend, down 5c/kg. The better condition 3 and 4 score heavy cows remained firm, while there were also some quality related price changes."
"Numbers increased and young cattle once again made up the biggest percentage of the offering while there was a fair penning of cows. Heavyweight steers were once again in short supply. All regular processor orders were in place and there was some very good restocker and feedlot competition.

Restockers were well catered for in the young cattle section of the market with the majority of the offering not quite suitable for the processors. All but a few plain quality yearling steers were purchased by restocker and feedlot interests. The steer market was dearer with vealer steers to restockers up to 6c dearer. Yearling steers in the lightweight catergories sold to a dearer trend, also up to 6c higher with some sales firm. lightweights were well sought by producers looking more closely at the dollar value. The medium weight catergories saw a vast improvement in quality that impacted on averages with the market also showing a dearer trend. Lightweight heifer yearlings to restockers saw the better quality grades sell to a cheaper trend while the lightweight plain quality lots sold to an dearer trend. Well finished trade yearling heifers sold 3c to 5c/kg dearer.

The majority of the grown steers were approximately less than 500/kg. The few well finished heavyweight steers sold firm to 1c/kg dearer. Restockers and feedlots were active on the lightweights. Grown heifers met strong competition and sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 7c/kg on the better quality grades. The cow market remained buoyant with the market generally firm with some lots showing a dearer trend. Heavyweight bulls also sold to a dearer trend."
"Numbers increased and quality was very mixed. There were some good quality lightweight heifer vealers, while the yearlings were generally plain. Cows made up the bulk of the export offering with too few heavy grown steers to quote. There was increased processor competition with the increased numbers and restocker demand was solid.

A line of lightweight heifer vealers sold strongly to restockers. The market trend for yearling steers to restockers was generally firm with quality accounting for price variations. Demand for lightweight heifer yearlings to restock was strong resulting in a dearer market trend, up to 7c/kg. The limited supply of well finished trade heifers also sold to a dearer trend, up 6c/kg.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote a trend, while restockers were active on the lighter weights at dearer prices. Medium weight grown steers were 2c dearer on 166c/kg. The cow market also saw the benefit of increased competition to show a firm to slightly dearer trend. Medium weight cows to slaughter were 7c higher on 135c/kg."
"Numbers increased and quality of the offering was fair to good with the majority of the offering showing better shape. Most grades were represented with greater than normal numbers of both yearling and grown heifers, they made up 30% of the offering. 

All the regular buyers were in attendance and competed strongly. This resulted in a firm to dearer trend throughout.Vealers, both trade and restockers were 4 to 7c/kg dearer and more in places. The medium weight heifer vealers were improved quality and this is reflected in their average price gains. The yearling grades also met solid competition, the steers to restock and feed were generally unchanged, any average price change related to numbers and quality. Trade yearlings both steers and heifers were firm to dearer, particularly the heifer grades, they saw rises of 4c to 8c/kg.

The grown cattle market followed a similar trend. The grown steers although lacking the bloom and yield of last week remained firm, the drop in quality accounting for lower prices. The grown heifers to kill saw a dearer trend, up 5c to 7c/kg. There were lower numbers of cows this week, mostly in the lighter weight grades. The medium and heavy cows saw a dearer trend, up 2c to 3c/kg. The bulls were firm to 2c/kg cheaper."
"Numbers increased although the quality was once again very mixed. There were some reasonably well finished yearlings penned along with plainer grades. Most grades were represented with increased numbers of grown steers and heifers although the steers were lightweights. Not all the regular buyers were in attendance, a trend that may continue until numbers increase, although this had no effect on values.

It was a generally dearer market throughout. All yearling steers went to restockers at rates 2c to 8c/kg dearer. Yearling heifers to processors were dearer, up 7c to 10c, while restocker heifer yearling heifers lost ground, down 4c/kg under restricted competition.

The grown steers were mainly lightweights of plain quality and growth for age, all going to restockers. There were no similar cattle last week to make a market comparison. The grown heifers had a similar story. Cow numbers were remained the same with the market firm to a shade dearer.

At the conclusion of the sale there was an offering of 550 one brand cows, the majority PTIC, which were sold on a dollars per head basis. Medium weight PTIC cows sold from $465 to $555, with heavy cows making from $630 to $675/head to both restockers and processors. The empty cows out of the mob sold from $470 to $530 with empty heifers 4 and 6 teeth selling from $505 to $560/head."
"Numbers increased again in what was mixed quality offering. Cows and grown heifers were well represented with good numbers of yearling cattle and a sprinkling of grown steers. All regular buyers were in attendance along with some extra restocker competition.

There were very few young cattle purchased by processors as restockers were very active and keen to buy. This saw all restocker grades show a dearer trend. Yearling steers sold at rates 4c to 15c/kg dearer with the lightest and plainest steers seeing the best of the market. Medium weights, although few in numbers, saw a good rise in value with quality a factor. Restockers were also active on light heifer yearlings with the market firm to 9c/kg dearer. Yearling heifers to the trade sold a trend firm to a shade cheaper.

There were no heavy steers last week to make a comparison. The few penned sold at rates equal to other recent markets for comparable cattle. There was little change in the market for grown heifers. There was no restocker interest in plain cows, although this had little effect on their market with the trend slightly dearer. Medium and heavy processor cows sold at rates firm to a shade cheaper."
"Numbers increased after last weeks rain reduced offering. Late vealers made up half the penning. Overall the quality was fair to good and there were some crop finished yearlings penned. Restockers were well catered for with activity good on steer lines. Not all processors were in attendance for export cattle.

Steer vealers attracted strong demand from restockers and sold firm to 9c/kg dearer. Heifer vealers to both the trade and restockers attracted weaker demand and sold firm to 10c/kg cheaper. Light and medium weight yearling steers sold at dearer prices, with most of the increase attributed to an improvement in quality. The very small sale the previous week saw insufficient heifer yearlings penned to make a market comparison, however, they sold at similar rates to other centres.

There were no heavy steers to speak of. Despite the limited competition the cow market showed an improvement in prices received. This improvement also involved a quality component."
"Numbers have settled into a fairly regular pattern as winter approaches. There was the usual large yarding of heifer vealers and steer weaners, while cows and yearling cattle were in slightly lower numbers. Heavy steers and bullocks were not in great numbers but their quality was fair to good. The weaner and vealer cattle quality was quite good from a condition and breed aspect but the trade cattle and feeders were just a little below last week for style.

There were the usual buyers in attendance and the market trend was firm to cheaper with some unevenness experienced. The huge number of weaner and vealer cattle selling in the North seems to have slightly restrained the market for some of the heavier calves in the regular markets but the lighter weights are still selling at very solid rates. Feeder steers were unchanged in price as were the trade heifers. However, some of the lighter yearling heifers were cheaper under mostly restocker competition. Competition for the feeder heifers which has been so strong recently was reduced this week.

Heavy steers and bullocks sold well again without any price changes, however numbers are restricted at the moment. Some of the cow market was irregular and therefore in a lot of cases difficult to follow. The very best cows sold very strongly indeed as did the light cows going to restockers. The middle weight cows however showed considerable variation with the nett result being an average drop of 4c to 5c/kg. There was no change in the bull prices."
"Numbers have reduced severely as is normal at this time of year. The quality of the yarding was very plain. Apart from a few overfat cows and a few trade heifers the bulk of the yarding were 2 score weaners and yearlings.   The competition on cows and the plain yearlings was restricted  with one major bulk buyer not operating.

Restock yearling steers were 4c to 5c/kg dearer under strong enquiry. The few trade heifers were fully firm but the balance of the weaners, plain yearlings and cows sold to a cheaper trend varying between 3c and 5c/kg.

There were insufficient heavy steers or bullocks yarded to quote any change in price."
"Numbers have more than halved in 2 weeks with a further reduction in supply. A line of 250 light weight EU accredited yearling steers were a feature in what was a yarding dominated by young cattle. Apart from those steers there were very few straight lines available. There was a reduced penning of cows and limited supplies of good quality and well finished grown cattle. The full field of processors were in attendance, while there was a little extra competition for young cattle, particularly restockers.

Market trends varied through the young cattle and there were some large price variations in some of the classes brought about by the mixed nature of the penning. Medium weight vealer steers suitable to restockers sold to dearer trends, significantly so in places. The medium weights sold to cheaper trends with a greater focus being placed on shorter term turnarounds. Conversely, the medium weight heifer vealers and restocker weaners sold to dearer trends with averages improving by 5c to 6c/kg. Those light weight yearling steers had been weaned for several months and attracted EU premiums. The non-EU cattle were very mixed in nature and sold mostly to a cheaper trend. Yearling heifers suitable to feed also saw a great range in breed and quality, the market trend was generally cheaper, down 13c/kg off the top with quality accounting for any other variation.

There were no well finished grown steers or heifers to speak of. The cow market saw trends dearer with the better 3 and 4 scores up to 3c/kg dearer, while the reduced number improved the average quality. The heavy bull market was significantly cheaper with a large drop in quality a contributing factor."
"Numbers have fallen once again. Females made up the bulk offered with limited numbers of steers available. The smallest numbers of weaner steers were offered for some time, as most have now been weaned. There were limited numbers of heavy steers, whilst yearling steers were in fair numbers.

Restocker and feeder orders were active on steer lines with the market dearer. The few vealer steers penned sold at rates 2c to 4c dearer, while the yearling steers sold 10c to 14c/kg dearer. Heifer vealers sold firm. Trade heifer yearlings sold to a firm to dearer market, up 3c/kg. There was feeder interest in the better quality heifer yearling not suitable to kill at rates firm on last week.

Not all export orders operated, although this had little effect on the market. Cheaper was the trend for heavy steers, down 2c to 3c/kg. Restockers were active on older steers with insufficient fat cover for the processors. The cow market saw some variation in the market. Plainer conditioned cows of all weights met good competition from both processors and restockers, they sold firm to slightly dearer. The better conditioned cows were generally cheaper, down 7c to 10c/kg although odd sales maintained last weekâ€™s rates."
"Numbers have continued to reduce from the peak yarding of three weeks ago. Apart from a few pens of cows and some small lots of trade cattle, the offering was again in plain condition. Cows, yearlings and light calves were in the greatest numbers. The usual regular buyers attended the sale but the abattoir and trade cattle buyers had difficulty finding sufficient quality cattle.

Young calves met a quieter enquiry with less restockers prepared to operate, and the light calves were cheaper by $20/head. All other young cattle sold at relatively firm prices with demand reasonably steady.

There were no bullocks available but the few heavier steers sold at firm rates. All the cows on offer sold at 5c/kg cheaper with buyers showing less enthusiasm than in previous sales. Export weight heifers met steady competition to record firm prices. There were only a few quality bulls yarded and their price was marginally cheaper.

The top sale price was an estimated 150c/kg paid by a restocker for light calves."
"Numbers halved with all categories represented. The quality of the offering was fair to good. There were some very well bred cattle penned, with the older cattle showing the higher condition scores. There was a high level of restocker and feedlot activity, however not all processors participated.

Trends varied in the vealer categories to restockers with the light weights selling to a cheaper trend, breed being a factor. The medium and heavy weight steers sold to dearer trends with the medium weights showing strong gains. Those trends followed into the heifer portion. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed posted strong gains with increased competition and premiums for selected breeds. There were very few heifers suitable to feed, whilst the heavy trade heifers sold to a dearer trend. 

Heavy grown steers sold to dearer trends with feedlots active on steers over 500kg. Heavy weights to processors were slightly dearer with some breed related price change. Well finished grown heifers attracted stronger demand to sell to a dearer trend. Demand was again high in the cow market with trends dearer throughout. There was a small improvement in the higher yielding cows, while the balance showed strong improvement. Restockers were keen to purchase any of the PTIC cows well over prices obtained for cows to process. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend.  

Market Reporter, James Armitage."
"Numbers fell to 500 head in a yarding comprising a large run of store condition cows and young cattle. There were odd pens of crop and grain finished steers, heifers and cows. There was restricted processor competition, however restocker demand was strong. Quality was a major contributing factor in some of the price variations recorded.

Weaner steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, with overall quality reasonably plain. Vealer heifers to both restock and the trade sold to a dearer trend. Yearling steers to restock also sold to a dearer trend, with most falling into the lightweight class. Breed quality also contributed. Heifer yearlings remained unchanged.

Quality was the reason behind the strong gains for the well finished heavy grown steers and there was increased competition. For the most part the grown heifers remained firm. Store condition cows attracted strong restocker competition to record significant price gains. A large line of mainly young cows contributed to the large price improvement. Despite limited processor competition, the well finished cows sold to a dearer trend of up to 4c/kg."
"Numbers fell once again, with reduced numbers normal for this time of year. The quality of the offering was only fair and there were few well finished young cattle in the pens. The low numbers contributed to a limited gallery of processors; however, restocker and feeder activity was high.

Steer vealers to restock sold to a dearer trend, with averages 20c to 40c/kg dearer. This increase also had a breed quality component to it. Heifer vealers also sold to a dearer trend, up 5c/kg. Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold up to 13c/kg dearer and included some obviously weaned steers. Medium and heavy yearling steers to feed sold firm to cheaper with quality an issue. Lightweight yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 5c to 19c/kg and more in places. Medium weights remained firm.

Grown steers and heifers sold to a cheaper trend. Restockers were active on the plain condition cows and those PTIC, with the market showing a dearer trend. Cows to processors sold to a cheaper trend with a drop in quality also a contributing factor."
"Numbers fell once again with this trend likely to continue in the short term. Quality was fair to good, with the condition of the young cattle suited the restockers. There were some well finished cattle in the offering although most were in the grown cattle section. All regular processors were in attendance with restocker competition increased.

The demand from restockers for young cattle was high and this was reflected in the market trend. Light and medium weight yearling steers improved by 6c to 13c/kg, with quality accounting for any other price variation. The lightweight yearling heifers also showed a dearer trend with those to restockers 13c dearer, while the lightweight trade heifers were 6c to 8c/kg dearer. C3 heifer yearlings also sold to a dearer trend.

There were too few heavyweight steers to quote, while grown steers to feeders sold quite a bit dearer. The quality of those steers also showed improvement. Grown heifers sold firm to slightly cheaper, however the fall in price was due to a quality variation. Finished cows to slaughter sold to a dearer trend, up 5c to 10c/kg. The plain condition cows to restockers and slaughter remained firm with quality accounting for the variations in price."
"Numbers fell by more than half. It was a very mixed quality penning with the quality of the heavy weight cows standing out. The gallery of buyers was smaller than usual.

Despite what looks to be a very promising season ahead, restocker confidence was down resulting in cheaper trends for cattle returning to paddocks. The quality of those available was a major contributor to the negative price change in most cases. Steers going onto feed also sold to cheaper trends for the most part while an improvement in quality accounted for positive price change in places. Yearlings heifers to restock and feed followed similar cheaper trends with some of the falls in price greater than those of the steers.

Limited processor competition saw the well finished heavy grown steers and heifers sell to cheaper trends. Demand for cows was not as strong from processors resulting in cheaper trends. Restockers were active on the plainer condition cows, particularly the larger frame pens. Heavy bulls sold to cheaper trends also."
"Numbers fell by more than half for a yarding of 450 head. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering along with a fair supply of grown cattle. The quality of the offering was fair to good with condition showing a great variation. The usual processors were in attendance however demand was subdued. Restocker activity was high.

Feed driven confidence was evident in the marketplace for better quality lightweight steers with both the vealers and yearlings to restockers selling to dearer trends with strong gains posted on the vealer portion.  Secondary quality lightweight yearling steers sold to cheaper trends.The vealer heifers to restockers also sold to a dearer trend. Medium weight yearling steers sold to a cheaper trend of as much as 20c/ kg.Quality and breed played a large part in cheaper trends for yearling heifers to restockers with prices well down on the previous sale.

There was little processor activity on grown steers with most going to restockers. Well finished grown heifers to process were considerably cheaper. This trend followed into the cows and bulls where prices fell significantly."
"Numbers fell away with some warmer weather and spring just around the corner. Most categories were represented and quality was fair to good. There were some well finished older cattle but few in the younger categories. Despite the low numbers, there was increased processor competition and an extra specialised feeder order for Angus steers.

There were varying market trend, with a limited supply of vealers selling to a cheaper trend for steers but dearer for the heifer portion. Good quality yearling steers to restock and feed were much dearer, with breed quality contributing. Some secondary quality steers were cheaper. The lightest of the heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend, with reduced competition, while those a little heavier were quite a bit dearer.

There was a small number of well finished heavy grown steers penned, not market comparison form last week though. Heavy grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. The increased competition saw the cow market dearer by 7c to 30c while the bull market improved by 30c to 35c/kg."
"Numbers fell away this week to 470, a perfectly normal happening in August each year. Quality was a lot better also, with some good pens of trade heifers and a number of very high yield cows providing the bulk of the offering. 

Probably because of the short yarding, the demand increased markedly. Weaner cattle, trade heifers, heavy steers and light bullocks showed a deal of improvement. Cows also were much dearer, with a quality improvement in all these cattle having been taken into account.

There was again a strong restock steer enquiry, which was met with a dearer market also and numbers were insufficient to satisfy the demand."
"Numbers fell away as they often do on the run up to the Christmas period. Quality was fair with some good lines of yearling restocker steers and trade heifers yarded. Cows were in fair numbers while bullocks were restricted to a few pens only. Trade heifers were well supplied while there were numbers of plainer bred older steers and heifers available.

Demand was keen for all young cattle. Trade heifers were dearer while very light vealers sold at firm prices. There was a strong enquiry for light steer vealers from restockers but supplies were severely limited. Demand for restocker yearling steers was steady and prices were firm. Feeder steers were unchanged in price.

Prices remained unaltered for the few pens of heavy steers and bullocks yarded, but small lots of plain older steers met a falling demand and the prices eased. Following last sales rapid price decline, all weights in cows were dearer by 4c to 7c/kg. Bulls and export heifers were unchanged in price.

Very light steer vealers to slaughter topped sale prices at 227.2c/kg."
"Numbers fell away as the weather warms, but the current yarding sizes are possibly the smallest at this time of year that we have seen for many years. No doubt the big sell offs during the drought years are totally responsible for the lack of cattle, and the seasonal conditions during winter have not been conducive to restocking. Apart from a few pens of crop fattened trade heifers and four or five pens of medium cows, the balance of the yarding were light conditioned yearlings mainly suitable for restockers.

The smaller yarding was responsible for a reduction in the number of buyers present and the market trend was either firm or cheaper. The trade heifers and the restocker yearling steers were firm, but the plainer yearling heifers were cheaper by 5c/kg. Restocker demand was strong enough but the plain quality stopped some prospective buyers.

The only quote possible was for cows which sold at 5c to 8c/kg cheaper; while bull prices receded by 10c to 12c/kg."
"Numbers fell again as the usual selloff period winds down. Young cattle were well supplied, particularly vealers and weaners. The quality of the offering was fair to good, however there were limited numbers of well finished cattle in any category. There was good restocker activity on young cattle, however feedlot competition was reduced especially on the plainer quality yearlings. Export processor competition was once again limited, although one did return to the market in a limited capacity.

There were varying trends through the young cattle, with restockers competing strongly for steer weaners. That market trend was dearer, up 2c to 10c/kg. Lightweight heifer weaners to restock sold to a cheaper trend, with little but quality related variations on the medium weights to restock and also to process. Heavy yearling steers to feed sold to a dearer trend with price increases also including a breed factor increment. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend. Medium weight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend as buyers look to target heavier exit weight specifications. Lightweight heifers generally sold to a cheaper trend with some quality variations.

There were no heavy grown steers to quote. Grown heifers suffered from a lack of competition to sell to a cheaper trend. There were odd sales through the cow market that remained firm, however for the most part trends were cheaper. There was a noticeable reduction in restocker activity on the plainer condition cows."
"Numbers dropped this week and while condition was mixed, quality over most of the yarding was generally good. Well finished cattle were scarce.  There were good runs of well-bred vealers with the steer portion being purchased by restockers, while most of the heifers sold to the light trade and restocker buyers. Yearlings were in good numbers and most were plain.

Unfinished steer vealers purchased for the paddock lost 4c to 10c and topped at 191c/kg for a pen of well-bred Angus steers. Light vealer heifers were cheaper by 4c to 7c/kg. Steer yearlings purchased by restockers and feeder buyers lost 8c to 13c/kg. Plain conditioned heifers were back, 4c to 20c/kg.

Steers and bullocks were scarce and most were plain and average prices showed little change. Cows were in fair numbers and condition varied considerably, while better yielding cows were mainly firm, most sales were back by 4c to 12c/kg."
"Numbers doubled with vealers and yearlings making up the majority of the offering. The increased numbers brought about some quality variations, with this having an impact on values and averages, particularly in the young cattle. Once again not all regular buyers were operating.

Light and medium weight vealers to processors sold to a cheaper trend, down 10c to 20c/kg. Vealers steers to restockers sold on a firm to dearer market with an isolated sale up to 20c/kg higher. Restocker yearlings were affected by quality. The best steers and heifers to feeders and restockers sold firm with the lessor quality cattle showing a cheaper trend. There were some weight related exceptions evident, with very lightweights seemingly unaffected. The trade yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend, falling as much as 10c/kg.

The quality of the grown steers was very plain, heavyweights to processors sold to a cheaper trend as a result. Restocker steers with 2 or more teeth also sold at cheaper rates. Grown heifers saw little change, both to slaughter and to feed on. The cow market eased in value, down 1c to 6c/kg, although there were few very good cows penned. The bull market saw little change."
"Numbers doubled with an influx of heavy weight feeder steers and a good supply of cows. There were limited supplies of vealers and weaners, with yearlings well supplied. The quality of the offering was generally good with condition forward to well finished. There was increased processor competition, with feedlot activity high. Restockers were also active throughout.

Strong restocker competition resulted in the weaners selling to dearer trends.  A limited supply of medium weight yearling steers sold to dearer trends also. Heavy weight yearling feeder steers up to 500kg, saw a firm to dearer market trend, where breed and quality had some effect on price change. Yearling heifers to feed sold to cheaper trends with the well finished heavy weights most affected. Restockers were active on the medium weights as both backgrounders and future breeders.

There was an increased supply of heavy steers over 500kg, including some milk teeth lots. The highly sought breeds of good quality sold to dearer trends, while the lessor quality and non specialist breeds saw prices cheaper. Well finished grown heifers to process saw varying trends with most cheaper. Odd improved quality heifers were dearer. There was a very good quality penning of heavy weight cows. The market showed little change. Restockers were active on the plainer condition cows pushing some prices to levels higher than the finished lots. Little change in the bull market.

Market reporter: James Armitage."
"Numbers doubled since the last sale. Young cattle were well supplied with some good lines of quality light weight yearlings and vealers penned. There was a fair supply of cows and a small number of heavy grown steers and heifers. Overall the quality and condition of the offering was fair to good. The increased number brought extra competition across all categories.

Demand for restocker cattle was again high. The majority of the young cattle carried more weight than those of the previous sale with this factor contributing to price variations within most classes. The market trend for young cattle to restock and feed was cheaper when compared to the sale 2 weeks ago, however prices achieved were on a par with those of other Northern selling centres.

Extra competition for export cattle saw the cow market 3c to 4c/kg dearer than the previous sale. Restockers were active on the plainer condition cows at dearer prices also. The bull market also showed strong price gains on the back of an extra buyer in the market."
"Numbers doubled from the previous sale. All categories were represented, although young cattle made up the bulk. There were some very good quality young cattle penned, alongside secondary lots. The condition of the offering continued its improvement with the majority showing the benefit of very good seasonal conditions. All the usual processors and feedlot orders were in place, with strong support from local restockers.

Strong demand from restockers and feedlotters resulted in the better quality yearling steers in all weight classes selling to a dearer trend. Strong gains were experienced for the light and medium weights to restock. The mixed quality nature of the offering resulted in the secondary cattle dropping averages in places. A mostly good quality penning of heavy weight feeder steers saw well bred lines sell to a slightly dearer trend, breed and quality accounting for some price change. Yearling heifers to restock and feed followed similar trends with some of the better quality heifers showing improvement. Most however showing little but quality related price change.

There was a small but very well finished penning of heavy grown steers. They sold to dearer trends with strong gains experienced. Heavy heifers also sold to dearer trends. A good quality penning of well finished heavy weight cows sold to a dearer trend of as much as 21c/kg under increased competition. Heavy weight bulls attracted plenty of demand with the market trend dearer with a lift in some yield potential."
"Numbers doubled as held over cattle were put forward with the start of a new financial year. There was a good supply of weaners, limited numbers of yearlings and grown cattle, while cows were in fair supply. There was a large variation in both quality and condition, while there was also quite a bit of quality variation within breeds. The usual processors attended, while restocker activity was very strong following up to 50mm of rain earlier in the week. That restocker activity went from heavy weight cows down to the lightest of the vealers.

Demand was high from all sectors through the young cattle with a small number of well finished trade cattle available. This demand combined with the increased supply resulted in dearer trends for the most part. Quality and breed variations played a role in some price change. Vealer steers to restock sold to dearer trends of 20c to 30c/kg regardless of the weight class. There was greater improvement in the heifer portion with a pen of well bred but lightly muscled heifers attracting a premium. Yearling steers to restock and feed in limited numbers were up to 20c/kg dearer. There were strong gains in the yearling heifers, with well finished lots showing the greatest improvement.

No heavy grown steers to quote. Well finished grown heifers attracted strong processor competition to record strong price improvement. There was little but quality related price change in the plainer condition cows to process. A couple of restocker orders were active. Strong competition from processors for the well finished cows saw them record the greatest market improvement, up to 35c/kg."
"Numbers decreased, with the biggest fall coming in the vealer categories. Yearling steers were well supplied and there was a fair penning of cows. Overall the quality was mixed and condition was on the plainer side as the cold weather and drop in feed value takes effect. There was a limited buying gallery, with not all regular processors in attendance.

The market for vealers was cheaper, with steers to restockers down 9c to 15c/kg. Very light heifer vealers to restock sold slightly dearer. The medium weight heifer vealers to the trade and restockers sold to a cheaper trend, down 2c to 7c/kg. There was good competition from restockers for an increased offering of light and medium weight yearling steers, with prices showing little change. There were, however, quality factors that contributed to some steers selling to a dearer trend. Heavy feeders also sold firm to slightly dearer. Yearling heifers sold firm to 1c/kg cheaper.

The limited supply of heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend, down 5c/kg. The cow market continued its downward trend, once again cheaper, down 4c to 6c/kg and more in places."
"Numbers decreased this week, with the offering mainly comprising vealers and cows. There was a fair supply of well bred vealers in lighter condition, suited to restockers. Overall, the quality and condition of the yarding varied. The gallery of buyers had greatly reduced in attendance and this was particularly noticeable in restocker and feedlot activity. The reduced competition had a major impact on market trends, resulting in cheaper trends. Despite this, there were a few market exceptions.

Vealer steers to restockers experienced decreased prices, despite breed quality. With limited feed stocks available in paddocks, the best prices were for heavier weights suitable for supplementary feeding. Restocker activity was also subdued for heifers, however price reductions were less due to support from trade processors. Vealers suitable to the trade sold to a dearer trend. The lack of competition saw medium and heavy yearling steers suitable to feed sell to a much cheaper trend. This carried through to the heifer portion, which saw prices decrease 30c to 40c/kg.

There were few well finished grown steers to quote as they sold to a cheaper trend. Additionally, due to less competition, the cow market saw cheaper trends, down 8c to 11c/kg. There was a large supply of bulls, with the better quality lots showing little change in trends."
"Numbers decreased in the smallest penning in several years, with the promise of a good spring just around the corner. Light weight yearlings dominated supply and there were very few heavy grown cattle. As to be expected the buying gallery was very small.

Restockers were active in the market with yearling steers selling to a dearer trend, up 1c to 8c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade remained firm, while lightweight C2 heifers to restockers sold firm to dearer. 

There were insufficient heavy grown cattle for a quote."
"Numbers declined further this week, with all categories represented. The quality of the offering was fair to good, comprised of some well finished grown steers, heifers and cows. Restocker activity eased slightly, while demand from export processors was much weaker. The return of some feedlot orders brought some market positivity.

Due to the reduced activity from restockers, market trends for young cattle returning to paddocks were significantly cheaper. Conversely, the increased feedlot competition resulted in a firm to slightly dearer market trend. Additionally, the quality of medium and heavy feeder steers also improved, with heifer yearlings to feed demonstrating strong price improvement.

Well finished heavy grown steers and well finished grown heifers were impacted by the weaker processor demand, resulting in cheaper trends. The steers decreased as much as 17c/kg, while the heifer prices decreased even greater. In the cow market, trends were cheaper by 30c/kg and more for cows showing better finish, however plainer condition cows were less affected."
"Numbers declined and quality remained fair to good as restockers and feeders competed for the lighter young cattle. Yearlings were in reasonable numbers and most returned to the paddock. Grown steers were limited and the heavier weights were in good condition and there was a mixed run of cows. All the usual buyers operated.

Restocking vealers were 4c to 6c stronger with heifers ranging from 190c to 213c for the medium weights and the steers reached 239c/kg. Trade vealers were mainly heifers and averaged 3c dearer selling from 181c to 210c/kg. Trade steers and heifers sold stronger ranging from 192c to 210c/kg.

Grown steers held firm as did the heifers although cows lost 4c to 6c with the 2 score cows ranging from 107c to 129c/kg. The 3 and 4 score cows received between 126c and 149c/kg."
"Numbers continued to stay at low levels and recent offerings have been well below the numbers in previous years. Quality was again very plain in a yarding which consisted of mainly yearlings with a few more pens of light vealers. Heavy steers and bullocks to slaughter were under supplied as were cows. Restocker cattle were again down in quality.

The usual regular buyers attended and the trend in the market was generally cheaper across most, but not all descriptions. Light and medium feeder steers were cheaper by up to 10c/kg, but feeder heifers remained much closer to fully firm. There were not enough trade cattle yarded to warrant a market quote. Restockers had great difficulty in obtaining numbers due to the lack of quality.

Demand for heavy steers, bullocks and export weight feeder steers weakened considerably and prices fell by an average of close to 10c/kg. Heavy export heifers, bulls and all cows met steady competition to remain fully firm."
"Numbers continued to increase after a few days of frosts. All but grown steers had good representation, however vealers, yearlings and cows made up the bulk of the offering. The quality was very mixed throughout, as was the condition. There was a greater percentage of yearlings showing better condition. There was reduced processor and live export competition, however restockers and feed lotters showed good support.

Market trends through the young cattle to restock were primarily dearer. Quality variations did affect price change in some classes to the negative. Vealer steers to restockers sold on a firm to slightly dearer trend, with some quality related price change. It was a similar trend for the better quality heifer vealers to restock, however some of the plainer quality lots had trouble maintaining their levels at times. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed sold on a firm to slightly cheaper market trend. The heifer yearlings to feed saw a dearer market trend, up to 13c/kg. Once again, some but not all of the plainer quality heifers experienced difficulty attracting much interest.

There were not enough heavy grown steers for a quote. Grown heifers suitable to feed attracted stronger demand and sold to dearer trends, with the plainer quality heifers showing the greatest improvement. The plainest condition light and medium weight cows sold to a much cheaper market trend. Medium weight 2 score cows experienced little change, while well finished heavy weight cows followed a similar trend. The absence of a live export buyer had a negative effect on the bull market."
"Numbers continued to fall away following an early spring sell off which left the area shorter of cattle than at any time in more recent years.  The yarding comprised plain and light weight yearlings together with some good conditioned cows, cows and calves and empty cows in light condition.  There were no bullocks, weaners or trade weight cattle available.

Values for the yearling cattle in better condition, were fully firm but light weights in the lightest condition were cheaper. Restockers bought almost all of these descriptions.  The few yearlings steers that were suitable for feedlots, were bought to restockers and sold at steady rates.  Two bigger pens of light calves were bought at open auction by restockers at an estimated average rate of 235c/kg.

There were only a few small lots of cows and calves which sold at open auction, and they made to $475/head, a cheaper rate than at recent sales.  The balance of the cows bought by exporters, sold at firm prices.  A few pens of plain cows were bought by restockers to go on to crop."
"Numbers continued to come forward, with more cattle than usual having been offered in the last few weeks, the dry weather being the major cause. There were some very well bred cattle in the yarding with some bigger runs of yearlings off crop. The steer portion was forward, but not fat, and the heifer portion were a little plainer. A feature in the sale was the sudden reduction in cow numbers while heavy steers and bullocks were again in light supply. Light supermarket weight feeder steers were in a greater supply than is usual.

The very recent trend towards a firm to dearer market continued even though the number of buyers present remained stable. Light heifer weaners were slightly dearer while the restocker steer weaners were fully firm. Yearling steers to restockers and feedlots were firm to slightly dearer also while heifer yearlings improved by up to 8c/kg. 

Demand for grown steers and light bullocks were considerably stronger with prices rising quite sharply in many cases. The lack of numbers in the cows caused a rapid increase value with some medium pens selling at up to 12c/kg dearer. The few pens of export heifers also recorded better prices. Bull quality was much improved and the prices paid were therefore dearer.

Top sale price was 138.8c/kg paid for light backgrounding yearling steers."
"Numbers continued their upward trend, with the yarding comprising of good supplies of vealers, yearlings and cows, while well finished heavy steers were limited. There were a few well finished grown heifers, most carrying 4 and 6 teeth. The overall quality of the offering was generally good, with condition also quite strong. The same buyers were in attendance.

Market trends through the young cattle varied, with vealer steers to restockers selling to a firm trend and only quality related price fluctuations. Heifer vealers to restock sold to a dearer trend, with competition very strong. Some prices improved by as much as 20c/kg. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend, averaging 5c-20c/kg lower on light and medium weights. The restocker cattle were most affected. Heavy feeder steers sold to a slightly dearer trend. Yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend, averaging up to 20c/kg and more in places with quality variations also a factor. 

There were too few heavy grown steers to make a market comparison. Well finished grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend, with a lot of the price variation age related with discounts for the 4 and 6 teeth lots. There was little but quality related price change in the market for well finished cows to process. Restocker cows were cheaper by 4c/kg."
"Numbers continued on the smaller side but average quality improved. Yearlings, feeder steers and cows were well represented, while there were a few more cows available. Prime cattle were much better represented than at the previous sale. After a light offering last sale, there were a few more bullocks yarded most of which were well fattened.

Demand for all classes of cattle was very strong with most young cattle selling at dearer prices. The few pens of trade heifers were 6c/kg dearer while values for feeder steers and restocker steers reached new heights in almost every individual sale.

Bullock values were very strong but the lack of numbers last sale made a definite quote difficult this week, even though indications were for a continuance of the dearer trend across the state. Cows sold at dearer prices for a better quality offering, while bull prices were firm, also for a better quality yarding.

Top sale price was 240.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight young steers."
"Numbers continue to increase with all grades well represented. The quality of the offering was varied with the usual well bred lines penned alongside quite a few plainer quality cattle. This was particularly evident in the yearling steers. There was also quite a variation in condition, this despite the New England experiencing its best season for a number of years. All regular operators were in attendance.

Along with the quality, the market also saw some variation. Restocker vealers steers sold to a dearer trend, up 7c to 10c/kg. The light heifer vealers also sold to a dearer trend, up 2c to 4c, while the heavier vealer heifers over 200kg sold firm to slightly easier. The drop in quality of the yearling steers affected the average prices through most grades, although taking quality into account the market trend was firm. With plenty of yearling heifers penned the market could not maintain itself. Lightweight yearling heifers to the trade sold cheaper, down 15c to 20c/kg. There were greater numbers of very well finished medium and heavy trade yearling heifers. The market was less affected with the trend firm to 4c/kg cheaper. Feeder heifers remained relatively unchanged.

The export cattle market saw the worst of it, a combination of supply and an increasing dollar value the most likely cause. The heavy steers and bullocks sold to a cheaper trend, down 2c to 8c/kg. Restockers were active on any grown steers not quite finished. The grown heifers sold cheaper, down 3c to 8c/kg. Cows and bulls followed the trend with cows 2c to 5c/kg cheaper, the bulls a similar drop in value."
"Numbers continue to increase as we enter the traditional sell off period for the Northern Tablelands. A large percentage of the offerings were weaners, heifer vealers and light yearlings. There were also some good lines of feeder steers and cows.

There were some extra feeder and restocker orders present this week. This resulted in the steer portion of the vealers and yearlings showing a dearer market trend. Buyers were prepared to pay improved rates for the better quality steers, while some of the lightly muscled steers lacking quality were discounted and sold at cheaper rates. The better quality grades were up 6c to 9c, while the plainer grades were cheaper, down 1c to 8c/kg. The opposite was seen in the heifer grades with the increased numbers meeting weaker demand. Vealers were down 12c to 14c, while yearlings were firm to 5c/kg cheaper.

The grown steer offering consisted mostly of older ages, resulting in cheaper prices. The trend however was unchanged. The cow market felt the effect of the high value of the Aussie dollar, at its highest level for some 10 years, with a cheaper market, down 5c to 10c/kg."
"Numbers continue to decline. All grades were represented in a fair quality and conditioned offering. There were a few well finished grown cattle, although well finished young cattle were in limited numbers. All regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market saw a firm to dearer trend through most grades. Local restockers continue to be active with vealers and yearlings returning to the paddock showing some very good price rises, vealers particularly. There was one very strong restocker order showing no preference for either steers or heifers with little regard for condition. Trade vealer heifers also sold to a dearer trend, pushed along by the restockers. Yearling heifers to the trade sold cheaper for quality.

Heavy steers and bullocks sold at rates equal to last week for the older cattle, while the 2 tooth steers sold slightly dearer. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend, although quality at the top end was not quite up to last sale. There was a large offering of cows, including a line of PTIC cast for age cows. The market saw plain condition cows to processors sell firm. The better conditioned cows sold to a dearer trend, up 2c to 6c/kg with odd sales of higher yielding cows showing better rises. There was a great deal of confidence shown by restockers on the PTIC  cows with rates between 130c and 152c/kg paid. Heavy bulls were cheaper."
"Numbers backed off a little although for no apparent reason. Most categories were represented, with good numbers of vealers and yearlings. All regular buyers were in attendance.

The quality of the weaners showed improvement, with greater numbers of heavier grades. Restockers and feeders were active on the steer portion with most going that way, very few to the trade. The market was generally firm, the exception being some of the lightweights, cheaper by 2c to 4c/kg. The heifer portion conversely saw most go to the trade, the market trend generally unchanged with a quality influenced price increase.

As with the vealers, most of the yearling steers were purchased by feeder and restocker interests at unchanged rates. Light steers were slightly dearer for the better bred and confirmation quality. Trade yearling heifers were firm while the feeder heifers were 3c to 5c/kg cheaper.

The grown cattle saw only a small number of heavy steers penned, selling at unchanged rates. The cow market defied the much cheaper trend of earlier in the week. Medium weight cows to slaughter were firm to 5c/kg cheaper and the heavy grades firm to 4c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls also attracted stronger demand and sold at dearer rates."
"Numbers are static at the moment and it is only the quality of the offering that is varying. The quality of this yarding was just below last sale with light and medium vealers and feeder steers of all weights making the biggest numbers. There were some pens of heavy steers and bullocks available but their yield potential was not high. Yearling cattle were in the usual numbers but there were surprisingly few cows yarded.

There was a good deal of variation in the sale particularly in young cattle. Very light vealers sold at firm prices to slaughter or to restockers but vealers and weaners over 200kg sold to a marginally cheaper rate. The loss in value also covered the weaner steers bought by restockers. The season with the exception of the far eastern fall of New England is starting to dry off and rain is needed before the onset of winter. Trade heifers were cheaper but not to any great extent.

In keeping with the trend this week in other sale yards the bullock and heavy steer market was cheaper following a lesser demand for all weights. Feeder steers however sold at slightly dearer prices for all weights. The cow market varied quite widely but the end result was a firm market except for some pens of light cows that lost a small amount in value. There were some signs that it would not take too much to see a cheaper cow market."
"Numbers are starting to reduce at the usual time of the year and the quality is not improving other than in a few of the best of the weaner and vealer cattle. There were also a few more of the top cows available. The weaners and cows made up by far the greatest percentage in the yarding with bullocks and heavy steers very short supplied, as were the trade yearling cattle. 

There was a greater demand for some better quality cattle with some extra competition for steer weaners and heifer weaners being received from local growers. That extra demand pushed prices for the best of the weaners to 6 and 8c/kg dearer while the plainer types were fully firm on last sale. Trade cattle were very much plainer but they sold at firm prices nonetheless.

There were only a few pens of heavy steers or bullocks yarded but because of that shortage demand was stronger and prices were therefore a little dearer. There was a much greater demand for the best cows only with prices dearer by 6c to 7c/kg. All other cow descriptions stayed at firm prices and that included a fair percentage of very light conditioned cows.

The top sale price was 165.6c/kg paid for quality Angus steer weaners."
"Numbers are on the decline in the area with another reduced yarding. The quality and condition offered was fair to good, with the stock holding up well despite the very cold conditions. Most grades were represented although weaner and vealer numbers are almost finished. All regular buyers were in attendance.

The market was strong throughout most grades. Restockers were active on most of the younger steers and some of the heifer lines. The market for vealer steers was firm to 10c/kg. Heifer vealers both to the trade and restockers were 8c to 16c/kg dearer. Yearling steers sold at rates firm to 6c/kg dearer. Trade yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend, up 1c to 8c/kg. It should be noted that any negative price variations relate to quality.

The grown cattle also met with a stronger market. There were quite a few grown steers penned with condition varying. Both restockers and processors were active with a shortage of kill cattle in Queensland evident as processors were purchasing leaner cattle than normally seen. Heavyweight steers to kill sold at rates 5c to 6c/kg dearer. Grown heifers also attracted good competition and sold to a dearer trend, up 6c to 9c/kg and more in places. The cow market was also strong with most grades showing rises of 3c to 9c/kg and more in places."
"Numbers almost halved with young cattle making up the bulk of the offering. Quality was very mixed throughout and mostly plain with some good cattle scattered though the categories. The usual buyers were in attendance, however there was reduced feedlot competition. Market trends varied and the quality also had an effect on prices.

Lightweight steer vealers to restock sold to a dearer trend, while the medium and heavyweights were 3c to 5c/kg cheaper and more in places. Heifer vealers to both the trade and restockers remained close to firm. There was a much smaller supply of well finished heifer vealers with that reducing competition. The quality of the yearling steers was very mixed, this combined with reduced competition saw the market trend cheaper. Some classes had an improvement in quality with this reflected in the price change. Good quality yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, up to 15c/kg.

There were too few heavy steers and heifers to quote. The cow market was stronger with the trend 2c to 7c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls were up to 10c/kg dearer."
"Numbers almost halved with the overall quality of the offering well below last week. Young cattle made up less than 50% of the penning with cows well supplied. There were almost 70 bulls offered with quality and weight extremely mixed. Most regular buyers were in place despite the drop in supply.

For the most part, young cattle sold to a cheaper trend. Vealer steers to restockers sold 10c/kg cheaper and more in place as the drop in quality contributed to the greater price change. Heifer vealers followed a similar trend to be down 5c/kg. There was a substantial drop in the quality of the lightweight yearling steers. Medium weight yearling steers to restockers were down 5c/kg. Lightweight heifer yearlings suffered the same issues as the lightweight yearling steers which contributing greatly to price reductions. The medium weight yearling heifers were in better quality and sold at firm prices.

There were too few heavy steers to quote. The cow market showed variable trends, with the best heavy, high yielding cows selling dearer by 3c to 5c/kg. The secondary quality cows lacking yield but still carrying some condition sold to a cheaper trend. Some restocker activity on the plain condition cows restricted price falls."
"Numbers almost halved for the final sale of the financial year. Quality and condition was fair to good with all categories represented. There was a much smaller buying group in attendance, however demand was quite strong through most categories.

Restocker steer vealers sold to a dearer trend, up 1c to9c/kg and more in places. There was a little more competition for heifer vealers to return to the paddock with the market trend dearer by 5c to 8c/kg. Both yearling steers and heifers to restock and feed recorded strong gains, however there were some secondary lots cheaper. The smaller numbers contributed to both quality and price variations.

Heavy grown steers remained firm with some improvement in average quality. The best of the cows remained firm. Plain condition cows to restock sold to a cheaper trend. There were extraordinary gains in the bull market."
"Numbers almost halved following the increased penning of the previous sale. The quality of the yarding was very mixed, however there were reasonable numbers of well-finished cattle in all categories. There were several pens of trade weight yearlings, while steers and bullocks were in reasonable numbers and most were presented in good to prime condition. The cow numbers however reduced considerably.

The market trend was dearer, with restocker buyers keen to make purchases following patchy rain and the approach of spring. Light restocker weaners were in limited supply and lifted 11c/kg in value. Restocker steer yearlings and feeder steers were up by 3c to 4c/kg. The top of the steer and heifer yearlings to slaughter were dearer by 5c to 7c /kg while the plainer end of the heifers eased in value.

Well-finished grown steers and bullocks had plenty of support with the C muscled types increasing in value. The cow market struggled to maintain the rates of the previous sale, with an easing in prices of 2c to 7c/kg.

The top price of 212c/kg was paid for a pen of lightweight restocker steer weaners."
"Numbers almost doubled, with the poor seasonal conditions forcing large numbers of lightweight yearlings onto the market, the majority of which would normally be taken though to finishing or heavier feeder weights. In contrast there were a number of lines of very well-finished grown cattle, steers, heifers and cows, mostly off crop. The usual trade and export processors were in operation, however restocker activity was somewhat subdued.

The weaker demand for restocker yearlings saw all but a small number of lightweight yearling steers sell to a cheaper market trend. This trend carried through to heifer yearlings, both to the trade and restockers. A very small number of lightweight heifers off crop and still showing freshness maintained the previous weekâ€™s levels. 

The limited supply of heavy grown steers were cheaper, with quality a contributing factor. Solid premiums were in place for the well-finished lots. This was also the case for well-finished grown heifers carrying enough weight for the export processors, however plainer condition heifers struggled to attract competition. The increased penning of cows saw a great variation in quality and condition from plain lightweights through to very heavy C muscles. The market for the better heavyweights was firm to slightly dearer, with the top price being paid for a line of very high yielding cows. The plain condition cow market saw quite a lot of variation depending on demand. If a number of buyers showed interest the market was firm, however if that interest was reduced then the market struggled to maintain last weekâ€™s level.

There were around 60 cow and calf units in store condition that made from $370 to $520, up to $250/unit cheaper than the previous week, with breed also playing a part."
"Numbers almost doubled, with little follow up rain in the past fortnight. Young cattle and cows were well represented, along with a fair representation of cows and calves, making from $680 to $1,150/unit. The quality of the offering was mixed, with the condition of the young cattle on the lower end of the spectrum. There were a few well finished lots through the older cattle, with some of the cows showing excess coverage. The usual processors attended and local restocker competition was strong, particularly on steers.

Market trends varied through the young cattle, with the localised restocker competition pushing light weight steers to a dearer trend of as much as 30c/kg on the preferred breeds. There was vast variability in quality and breed through the yearling steers, this accounted for the large price variation. The limited supplies of medium and heavy weight yearling steers suitable to feed also sold to a dearer trend when compared to the sale a fortnight ago. Conversely, yearling heifers to restock and feed did not attract the same level of competition as the steers, resultin in cheaper trends throughout.

There was no market comparison for the few well finished heavy grown steers. Well finished grown heifers sold on a firm to slightly cheaper market trend. The cow market experienced little change in the fortnight, with restockers active on the plainer condition lots."
"Numbers almost doubled with a large offering of vealers. Yearlings and cows were also in good supply, however there were few other grown cattle. The quality of the overall penning was fair to good with an increased number of young cattle showing good finish. The regular processors were in attendance and there was extra restocker and feeder competition.

Demand for steer vealers from restockers was stronger with the market trend firm to dearer. Breed was the major contributing factor in the lower average price for the heavier steers with a lot smaller percentage of the preferred breeds penned. There was a much larger penning of heifer vealers with the medium and heavyweights to the trade and processors remaining close to firm, odd sales dearer. Heifers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, despite the extra competition, down 3c to 4c/kg with quality variations accounting for other price changes. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw light and medium weights firm to 7c/kg dearer, with heavier weights selling to a cheaper trend. There was an odd exception. Medium and heavy yearling heifers to the trade sold to a dearer trend with prices averaging 2c to 15c/kg dearer, once again quality played a part.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote a trend. The cow market was dearer with the trend firm to 5c/kg higher. There was good competition from restockers looking for cows showing plenty of frame and weight gain potential."
"Numbers almost doubled in the week, with the bulk of the increase being restocker yearling cattle. Most categories were represented by some well fattened or well bred stock. Yearling steers were in the biggest numbers while there were good numbers of cows as well as some good lines of young bullocks. Trade cattle were poorly represented in numbers while light vealers were good quality and in fair supply.

Competition was strong for most young cattle, particularly restocker weaners and yearlings, and demand was almost unprecedented. Most restocker cattle varied between 12c and 20c/kg dearer with growers bidding well above any recent sale prices. Trade prices were firm but quality cattle were limited to just a few lots. Vealers under 200kg liveweight sold strongly to record a dearer market even with the considerable increase in value taken into account.

Bullocks met keen demand and were dearer by 4c/kg, but the rest of the export cattle were cheaper. Cows and older heifers in all weight and fat categories, were cheaper by up to 10c/kg. Bull prices also cheapened as demand for export cattle weakened. 

Top sale price of the day was the 264.2c/kg paid by a restocker for very light vealer calves."
"Numbers almost doubled as the uncertain Easter period of markets gets back to normal. Quality was a little better on most descriptions, with the best vealers of the season coming forward, and some numbers of high yield cows were presented . There were a few more orders available this week, providing a much improved market for all types.

Vealers in big numbers, were dearer by up to 4c to 8c/kg, with light heifer veal selling, in some cases, to 16c dearer. Yearlings averaged close to 6c/kg, dearer.

There were only a few pens of heavy steers available, and they sold to a dearer trend.

Cows were,also, the big improvers in the market, with many pens selling up to 18c/kg  dearer, but averaging 5c to 11c dearer, depending on yield."
"Numbers again reduced following the light rain of two weeks ago which coincided with the normal seasonal fall in yarding size. Quality was very plain with only a few fat cattle available. The bulk of the offering were cows and yearlings with a few pens of splitter calves but no heavy steers or bullocks were in the yarding. The yarding also included 60 cows and calves that sold to just over $500/head to restockers.

The market for all the young cattle was the same as last week with the supply of restocker and feeder cattle being not enough to satisfy the considerable demand. Feeder steers and the yearling restocker steers were better breed quality than last sale and consequently sold at higher prices.

There were no bullock or heavy steers yarded and the cow market was slightly dearer for all weights and descriptions. The bull market was firm but there were very few of the better yielding bulls yarded. 

The top sale price was 146.2c/k paid by a restocker for lightweight yearling steers."
"Numbers a few less than last sale with the quality in young cattle a little plainer, but there were good pens of high yielding heavy steers, bullocks and cows. Restockers attended in numbers, interested in light steers and those steers over 400kgs 3 score. Very little change in value for trade cattle and plain yearlings, but as in other sales across the North, rises of  5 to 7 c/kg on heavy steers, bullocks and most cows and bulls.
Feeder steers were not in great number but sold to a dearer trend of  3/4 cents."
"Number were reduced and were mainly made up of vealers with 25% of the offering cows, all grades were however represented. The condition of the offering was best described as wintry with the exception of a small number of vealers, heavy steers and cows. The breed quality was fair to good. A single export buyer was not in attendance, although this played little part in the trend of the market.

The young cattle market was pretty good. Restocker vealer steers and vealer heifers experienced little change. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 6c/kg. Weight and quality was a factor. Trade heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend, down 6c to 8c/kg, while the restocker and feeder grades remained firm.

There were a few better quality and younger heavy steers offered. Taking this into account the market trend was firm to slightly cheaper. Rates were equal, while the quality improved. Grown heifers also experienced a cheaper trend. The cow market saw the best yielding grades remain firm, while the balance of the offering sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c to 9c/kg. The heavy bull market was cheaper."
"Number increase was probably caused by last week's price rises following the rain. Quality was much improved and the best seen in Armidale for many months. All classes were fairly represented, with greater numbers of  very good high yield cows and over 600 heifers were yarded. The young cattle sold from firm to 4 cents cheaper for the trade heifers, just a little easier for heavy steers and bullocks but cows couldn't sustain the rises of last sale and lost 60% of that improvement. Restockers were very keen on young steers at values equal to, and some slightly dearer, than last sale."
"Not the lowest number ever penned here, however it was not too far from it. There were a few in each category with quality very mixed. The usual processors were in attendance along with a few restockers.

All categories recorded cheaper prices than pre-Christmas levels. Whether that is for the future remains to be seen with numbers expected to return to normal in the coming weeks. As usual, rain and price will be a determining factors in those numbers with seasonal conditions quite good over the drawing area at the moment."
"Not all buying companies attended this sale as some are not yet back in production following the Christmas break. Quality was fair in a small yarding with yearling heifers and cows making up the bulk of the offering. Bullocks and heavy steers were light supplied and were also well down in quality and yield. Restocker cattle were in fair numbers but their breed quality was average only. Bulls were in fair numbers but most were fairly oplain and light yielding.

The demand for trade cattle and light splitter vealers was particularily strong as retailers needed cattle to fill next weeks orders and demand. There was therefore a fully firm to slightly dearer trend in all killable light cattle. The restocker yearling steers sold at much the same rates as before Christmas with no sign of any cheapening even though the hot weather is quickly drying off the feed.

Cows sold well even though the competition was reduced by one major exporter. All cows sold strongly after a slightly wary start from buyers. Bulls were cheaper but there was no yield in any of them. Heavy steers and bullocks sold at cheaper rates but this was mainly caused by the lack of quality and yield. Older feeder steers sold at near enough to the rates of the last sale in December 2000 but again quality was well below that  sale."
"No sale in Armidale since 20th March, and the comparisons here, are with that sale.  A similar sized yarding, but reduced quality, with few properly finished cattle yarded, and a very heavy percentage bought by Restockers. Due to the comparison with March 20th, there was an expectation of price rises in some descriptions, and those rises were the order of the day with vealers and yearlings firm to 2 cents better, steers, bullocks and cows, 2 and up to 5 cents dearer, and export feeder steers unchanged. One extra operator was in attendance, handling export type stock."
"Most of the smaller yarding was composed of restocker yearlings or weaners with the bulk being in the lighter weight ranges. Cows were well supplied and two scores were in the majority in a wide variety of weights. There were no trade cattle yarded nor were there any finished bullocks available. Feeder heifers and heavier feeder steers were in fair numbers.

Demand for restocker weaners and yearlings was again very keen with the greatest demand being reserved for the lighter weights. The restocker steer portion was fully firm while a few pens of the heifers were slightly easier. The few slaughter vealers were also fully firm. 

Demand for all cows slackened with all weights and fat scores selling between 6c and 12c/kg cheaper. The bull market suffered a similar price fall. Heavier feeder steers were in demand but there were not many offered and the prices remained firm. Older heifers dropped an average of 5c/kg compared to last sales rates.

The top sale price recorded was 249.2c/kg paid by a restocker for quality lightweight steer yearlings."
"More rain brought about fewer cattle in a reduced yarding. Young cattle dominated supply while there were increase numbers of heifers breaking their permanent teeth. There was a good supply of well finished yearling heifers supplementary fed. All regular processors were in attendance.

Restockers were once again active on light weight cattle, both steers and heifers. The better quality light weight yearling steers showing a bit more muscle pattern sold to a dearer trend, averaging 3c/kg with an isolated sale up 13c/kg. The lightly muscled light weight yearling steers sold to a cheaper trend. The light weight heifer yearlings were purchased by restockers at cheaper rates with very light weights showing a cheaper trend of 15c/kg. The well finished trade heifer yearlings sold at similar rates to other centres although a market trend is not available as there were no similar cattle penned at the previous sale.

There were no heavy steers to quote while a market comparison for the grown heifers is not possible for the same reason as that of the trade heifer yearlings. The cow market realised a cheaper trend throughout all but the small number of restocker cows, they were dearer."
"Minimal falls of rain up to the time of sale had no effect on the yarding size even though numbers were reduced. Quality was much improved with weaner and vealers numbers reaching over 60% of the total yarding. Included in the yarding were a few pens of excellent heavy vealers, which were a feature of the sale. Trade cattle, cows and heavy heifers were short supplied, while heavy steers, light bullocks and yearling restocker steers were in fair numbers.

The usual buyers attended and the trend in the young cattle market was firm or dearer. Restockers, possibly in anticipation of further rain, bid strongly for suitable weaners and yearling steers. The market for all weaners was dearer with the average quality well above the previous week. Yearling steers were dearer under intense restocker demand. Trade cattle were hard to quote due to a lack of numbers.

Heavy steers and bullocks sold at firm rates for all weights and ages, while some of the older and less attractive feeder steers sold at marginally cheaper prices. Heavy export heifers were fully firm as were all weights within the cow market. Demand for bulls increased and the market was an average of 7c/kg dearer.

Top sale price was 219.2c/kg paid by a restocker for very lightweight steer weaners."
"Mid December was the last Armidale sale and with such a long break the increase in numbers was anticipated. The yarding was heavy in good yielding cows and yearling heifers, but contained very few steers of any description.  All the usual Operators were in attendance.

Yearling cattle, steers and heifers sold at a slightly cheaper rate, with Restockers leading the demand for the steers. There were pens in the better heifer and steer yearlings that sold at firm rates, although the average was down.

The older and the heavier steers were selling at dearer values, but the cows were struggling to maintain the high rates of mid December, even though the yield in these cattle was better. The few pens of export feeder steers sold well, at figures above mid December's rates."
"Many growers must have decided to sell off at the same time rather than feed cattle and that is the explanation for the sudden increase in numbers. It was a much softer quality yarding with over 800 cows yarded. Weaners of both sexes were also in large numbers but trade cattle and heavy steers and bullocks were again in short supply.

There were a number of extra southern orders for both restocker weaners and young slaughter cattle and that assisted in creating a dearer market for all young stock. Restocker weaners averaged slightly higher due to better quality than last week. Demand for light heifer weaners was also more sustained than at the previous sale. Yearling feeder and restocker steers and the few trade heifers available all sold to a dearer trend under good competition.

The older feeder steers met stronger enquiry and sold at dearer prices while heavy steers and light bullocks were fully firm when compared to last sale. The cow market and the heavy export heifer market maintained the rate following the very strong showing of last sale. The bull market was solid and firm on last sale also. This quote is the first time for a number of weeks that prices have risen.

The top sale price was 185c/kg paid by a restocker for quality steer weaners."
"Low numbers continued and are likely to remain so for some time. This is common for this time of the year. The quality was quite mixed although there was a good supply of well finished heavy steers and heifers. Not all the usual processors operated however competition for feeder cattle was keen. There wasnâ€™t as much demand from restockers with little in the way of a rain forecast about.

With sales being held on a fortnightly basis and quite a variation in quality market comparisons are difficult. Pricewise there were some increases where there was an improvement in quality through the young cattle suitable to the feedlotters. Some of the secondary quality light weight restocker yearlings saw prices retreat somewhat.

All the good quality heavy grown steers over 500kg went to feeders although there was nothing to compare prices to from the previous sale. The well finished grown heifers also had nothing to compare to. Well finished heavy cows sold to a dearer trend with an improvement in quality. The plainer condition cows saw little but quality related price change."
"Low numbers continue to be the norm on the Tablelands at this time as the transition from winter to spring slowly takes place. The yarding was made up of young cattle, grown heifers and cows in the main. The quality offered was quite good although the condition continues to be on the plain side. Not all regular buyers were in attendance.

Restocker and feeder cattle continue to dominate the yearlings with very few yearlings suitable to the trade. With grain prices rising and green feed coming slowly, young cattle suitable to take on met with weaker competition. Yearling steers were down 10c to 20c with the heifer grade 10c to 12c/kg cheaper. The limited number of trade and processor yearlings sold at firm rates.

There were no grown steers to speak of with heifers and cows dominating the offering. Heifers carrying 2 teeth or more sold to a cheaper trend, down 9c to 17c/kg for both feeder and processing grades. There were quite a number of plain conditioned cows penned, something not seen for some time. These cows were purchased by restockers at rates similar to those seen at other centres. Cows to slaughter sold on a market that experienced little change."
"Less than anticipated rainfall saw numbers double. Overall quality offered was plain, with some cows and grown heifers the only cattle carrying much condition. The dry seasonal conditions saw an increase in cow/calf units as well as split units. There was a restricted presence from processors however there were a couple more feeder orders in place.

The quality of the young cattle combined with weaker demand from restockers saw yearlings sell to a cheaper trend. Steers were well down with heifer yearlings 5c to 7c/kg cheaper.

Most of the grown steers went to feedlots regardless of weight. Only a couple of well finished heavy steers sold at similar prices to recent sales. The well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, up to 7c/kg. Plain condition medium weight cows sold to a cheaper trend. There were some very good heavyweight cows penned with one pen expected to yield very high. The market trend was dearer, up 4c to 10c/kg with quality contributing."
"Less numbers were yarded, although cow numbers increased. Yearling cattle made up the bulk of the offering with heavy steers in limited supply. The quality offered varied as did the condition. Restocker yearling steers were not quite up to last weekâ€™s standard and the yearling heifers did not carry a lot of weight. Not all buyers were in attendance, although this had little effect on the market.

Restockers continue to be active on most steers. The market was firm. There were odd sales showing slight rises although that related to lightweights. Light heifer yearlings, both trade and feeders, sold firm to 5c/kg dearer. Once again weights tended to the lighter side. Medium weight heifers were 5c to 6c/kg cheaper.

There were no heavy steers to speak of penned. Grown heifers sold firm to slightly cheaper. The cow market was a bright spot in the sale showing a dearer trend, up 8c to 10c/kg. The bull market remained firm."
"Large numbers of cattle continued to be yarded, with vealers and yearlings making up a large percentage of the yarding.  Cows were again well supplied, while grown steers and heifers were in limited supply.  Quality of the young cattle was mixed with a fair percentage of vealers loosing their blum however, there was some good runs of well bred cattle offered.

All the vealer and yearling steers went to restockers and feeders, along with a fair percentage of vealer heifers being acquired by feeders and restockers. Competition was stronger with restocker vealer steers selling firm to a dearer trend.  Medium weight C2 vealer steers sold from 162c to 192c, while vealer heifers to the trade were 3c/kg dearer, restocker and feeders gained more. Domestic feeder steers held firm while the heavyweight steers gained some ground.  Trade and feeder heifers saw little change.

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows, along with a few pens of grown steers and heifers.  Quality of the cows was mixed with increased numbers of good yielding medium and heavyweights and a fair number of plain grades.  Demand was stronger with all export buyers keen to acquire cows, resulting in medium weights selling firm to 2c/kg dearer and heavyweight cows gaining more. 

Medium to heavyweight bulls sold from 100c for the plain medium weights through to 141.2c for the better quality C2 bulls averaging 135.6c/kg."
"Large numbers of cattle are coming on to the market as the autumn sell off continues. Vealers and yearlings made up a large percentage of the yarding, while there was a good supply of grown cattle.  The quality of the young cattle was good with some good runs of well bred cattle through the sale.

Most of the vealer steers and heifers went to feeders and backgrounders with the better bred cattle attracting the keenest demand. Steers sold firm to 3c dearer however, the heifers were down by 3c to 8c/kg. Vealer heifers to slaughter also lost some ground. Yearling feeder steers sold to a dearer trend with some up to 9c/kg dearer. Three score feeder heifers held firm while the lighter 2 scores were up to 7c/kg dearer.

The yarding of export cattle consisted of a fair penning of grown steers and heifers and a good yarding of cows. Bullocks and steers were up by 3c/kg with the young steers making the premium rates. Heifers gained some ground, while the cow market held firm for the medium weights and heavy cows were 4c/kg dearer."
"It was the usual late autumn yarding with some very well bred and well finished cattle yarded, but they tailed off to some very plain and light weight stock. There was another big cow yarding with all weights of cows making up over a third of the total. The balance were weaners, yearlings and just a few pens of bullocks, some of which were under done from a condition viewpoint.

Most young cattle met a more positive market trend, but the big numbers of steer weaners offered in New England in recent weeks, appears to have reduced the current restocker demand and those cattle sold cheaper. Weaner and vealer heifers and restocker steer yealings were all dearer under keen demand. Trade cattle were a little more plentiful and they also sold to a dearer trend.

There were a few pens of fair quality bullocks yarded, and together with the feeder steers, they sold at dearer rates. The major market movement was in cows. All weights showed considerable price rises with the heavier, better yielding cows gaining the most. Restockers were again very active on the lighter cows to fatten. Bull prices continued to fall as demand weakens each week. 

The top sale price was 200c/kg paid for very light steer weaners to restock."
"It was the largest offering in several years and a reflection of the poor seasonal conditions. Large numbers of cows and young cattle were presented, with calves split from cows early well represented. The quality of the young cattle was only fair. There were limited numbers of yearlings with condition sufficient enough for trade buyers to compete. There were some better quality vealers offered, however most were poorer condition. The regular processors were in attendance, although there was restricted restocker and feedlot competition.

A very small number of good condition vealers sold to processors at prices equal to slightly above pre-Christmas levels. Trends through young cattle to restock and feed were cheaper than the last sale before Christmas. Significant price falls were recorded through most categories and reflected a lack of demand and larger than usual supplies. The cattle most affected were the plain quality and condition lines in both yearling steer and heifer categories. Buyers of cattle to put onto feed were looking for as much weight as possible to suit exit requirements, with heavy yearling steers least affected.

There were a small number of well finished heavy grown steers and they sold firm on the pre-Christmas sale. Grown heifers lacking sufficient fat cover and muscle pattern experience a considerable price reduction, while well finished heavy weights sold well in comparison. There were some very good cows penned alongside large numbers of plain condition lots. The market for the well finished heavyweights was generally firm, with the odd dearer sale. Plain condition cows experienced some large price variations on a firm to cheaper market trend where weight and yield potential were a contributing factor."
"It was interesting to note the drop in numbers in the market with a similar trend being repeated in some but not all saleyards throughout the week. Quality generally through all descriptions was better than last week with the yield estimate on the export cattle one or two percent higher. For the first time for some years there were no steers sold to feedlots which may well be an indicator for the coming weeks. Trade cattle were short in supply once again. Cows were in fair numbers and there were a number of pens of well finished Bos Indicus cattle that showed a higher yield potential.

The trend in young cattle was firm to slightly dearer with light restocker steer weaner and a few pens of good trade heifers being dearer due to the lack of supply. Restocker yearling steers sold well but there was no rise in price evident.

Bullocks sold at dearer prices of 1 or 2c/kg but the extra yield expected would have dissipated any perceived rise. Export heifers sold strongly at slightly dearer prices while cows were also selling at dearer rates but the yield was better. Bulls were firm.

The top sale price was 214.2c/kg paid by a restocker for light steers weaners."
"It was another very plain quality yarding with the biggest percentage being cows and plainer bred yearlings. There were over 80 head of fair to good quality cows and calves yarded and they were purcheased by local growers at prices up to $820/head. Most of the cattle were bought by restockers with very few going to slaughter.

The market was considerably cheaper and even though the lack of quality resulted in cheaper quotes, there was still a lack of interest shown in many descriptions and values fell. Most of the plain younger stock sold at values between 15c and 25c/kg cheaper while the light calves were to 40c/kg cheaper, grower interest being minimal.

The older and plainer restocker steers were 15c to 20c/kg cheaper while cows in all descriptions were easier in a range of 16c to 22c/kg. The bull price however held firm for the better muscled types."
"It was another very plain conditioned yarding with the numbers down to only one third of the last sale offering. It was probably the lightest conditioned yarding since the drought began and by far the greatest majority of the cattle were bought by restockers. Cows and light calves and yearlings were the bulk of the offering with only a few feeder steers or light bullocks.

The usual regular buyers attended and the prospect of a few storms in the area brought out an increased presence of restockers looking to have something on hand if it did rain. There were some cattle a little cheaper in the market but most were firm or dearer. Restockers made light yearling heifers dearer but the steer portion remained firm. Restocker demand was also responsible for a rise of $20 to $30/head in the light calves while all other young cattle were fully firm.

There was less interest from meat buyers in the few light bullocks or feeder steers with those prices averaging 8c/kg cheaper. The same price loss applied to the bulls. A number of pens of two score medium cows lost value to the extent of 6c/kg, with less restocker interest being shown.

The top sale price was an estimated 210c/kg paid by restockers for light calves."
"It was another small yarding, comprising quite a few plain quality light weight cattle and very few well finished heavy cattle. There were a small number of well finished yearlings suitable to the trade. There was restricted export processor competition due to the lack of suitable cattle. With the arrival of spring and recent timely rain local restockers showed a great deal of confidence in the market and competed strongly for the plain light weight young cattle.

There were varying trends through the young cattle however most were dearer. Plain light weight yearling steers and heifers sold significantly dearer, with most of the steers improving by 40c to 50c/kg. Light weight heifers were less affected and there was some quality related negative price change. Well finished heifers to the trade sold to a dearer trend, averaging 9c/kg dearer.

There were insufficient heavy grown steers to quote. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend. Plain condition cows attracted both restocker and processor competition to sell to a dearer trend, however there were too few well finished cows to attract much competition and they sold to a cheaper trend. The bull market was slightly dearer when taking quality into account."
"It was another small yarding this week, consisting of a good supply of young cattle and a fair penning of grown heifers and cows. Apart from the odd pen, overall quality was plain, however there was several pens of well-bred cattle that met keen restocker demand.

The market was stronger for most classes of cattle, with restocker vealer steers selling 20c dearer and topping at 228c/kg. Trade yearling steers topped at 191c, while restocker yearling steers sold to 217c and feeders to 191c/kg. Trade yearling heifers were up by 10c, selling to 197c, while those to restockers made to 174c/kg.  

The yarding of export cattle also met keen competition, with grown heifers selling up to 20c dearer and topping a 197c/kg. The cow market improved by 20c to 30c, with heavy cows selling to 177.2c and medium weights averaging around 153c, while bulls sold to a top of 200c/kg."
"It was another small penning at Armidale, not uncommon at this time of the year. All categories were represented and quality was fair to very good as was condition. There were some very good heavy grown steers and cows. A small but active group of processors were in attendance and there was strong restocker competition.

High demand from restockers heading into what promises to be a very good Spring, saw light weight young cattle sell very strongly. Both steers and heifers attracted strong competition. The medium weight yearlings sold to cheaper trends with low numbers and minimal feedlot competition both a factor.

Well finished grown steers to process sold to dearer trends, as did the well finished heifers. There was strong competition in the cow market with all classes showing significant improvement. Competition carried into the bull market where heavy weights posted strong gains.

Market Reporter, James Armitage."
"It was another plain yarding of cattle with plenty of yearling heifers available and only limited numbers all other grades. The heifers were mainly lighter weights suitable for restockers and for the trade and most were around 220kg. There were no bullocks yarded and the balance of the yarding was mostly yearling and older steers and a limited yarding of medium cows and heifers suitable for export. There were only two bulls yarded.

A full field of the regular buyers attended, and with the prospect of rain in the air, an increased number of restockers were active on suitable lines of cattle. The yearling heifers and the few trades available met a fully firm market, as did the few restocker steers. The feeder steers in the yarding were plain and they sold at marginally cheaper rates. There were no vealers available.

There were no bullocks or heavy steers to quote. Export heifers sold at fully firm prices however, most pens of cows were up to 5c/kg cheaper. 

The top sale price recorded was 245.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight steer yearlings."
"It was an unusually small yarding for the first sale of the year at Armidale today with plenty of feed about and vendors preferring to wait and see how the market opened. The quality was considerably better  with most descriptions fairly well represented and the fat quality was definitely improved on the last sale in mid-December.

The usual regular buyers attended and the market trend was firm to dearer. The restocker and feeder yearling steers were better bred than the last sale and they sold at very firm rates with the demand undiminished on the sale before the break . The demand for trade cattle was very strong indeed with heifers in particular selling at a dearer rate.

There were fair numbers of heavy steers and bullocks available and meatworks were obviously looking for cattle to kill immediately thus creating a dearer market for these cattle. The same situation applied to the cows with a dearer market for all cows of all weight and fat categories. An exception to the trend was the bull market which seems to have seen its best prices at least in the short term.

In general there appears to be a continuing shortage of most descriptions of cattle and the result is a firm to dearer market on almost every category."
"It was an increased yarding and the average quality was plain with the exception of some weaner steer pens and a few pens of top cows. There were no bullocks to quote in the sale and even the steers 400kg to 500kg were in very low numbers. The bulk of the yarding were weaners and yearlings together with cows which made up 25% of the total. 

The overall trend in the market was cheaper with a number of cattle dropping away very considerably in price. After a few frosts and very little rain for six weeks the local store cattle buyers have all but disappeared from the market. The extremely heavy numbers of weaners sold on the tablelands recently has tended to cheapen the market for  restocker cattle to the extent that all but the very best of the steer weaners fell by an average of 10c/kg. Heifer vealers to slaughter were cheaper but not to the same extent. Trade cattle did not change much.

Feeder steers of all weights also cheapened in what was seen as a considerable lessening of interest. There were no bullocks and very few fat steers yarded . 

The two score cows of all weights lost value with no grower competition at all. The medium weights were also cheaper but not to the same extent while the heavy cows did not show much change. It was obvious that meat operators have been suffering low yields on light cows and the increase in numbers has lead to the price drop. The bull market was very solid and unaffected."
"It was a wet weather market in Armidale with the numbers halved by the recent heavy rains. There were only a few lots of trade yearlings offered, but cows and light bullocks were in both fair numbers and demand. By far the greatest majority of the cattle were very plain and unfinished yearling steers and heifers.

The yearling cattle sold to a slightly dearer trend,  and that included the few quality restock steers. The demand was certainly there, but the supply was not.

The big increases were in cows and bullocks, with the heavier types, in particular, meeting strong competition, presumably, due to the wet weather numbers reduction."
"It was a very small offering to finalise sales for the year. The quality of the penning was quite mixed with a good supply of well finished grown heifers a feature. Light weight young cattle also well represented. Restricted processor and feedlot participation, however restockers were active on the light weight cattle.

Market trends were significantly dearer through the young cattle. Restockers looking to fill paddocks in front of a 3 week break. Medium and heavy weight yearlings to restock and feed also posted strong gains.

A small number of heavy grown steers to process sold substantially cheaper under restricted competition. Well finished grown heifers to process were also cheaper. The grown heifers to feed sold to a much dearer trend with the quality of the cattle contributing to strong price improvement. Cows were cheaper, while the bull market saw the largest price fall for the day with limited competition.

Market reporter,  James Armitage"
"It was a surprisingly small yarding for February. Apart from good numbers of well bred restocker steer yearlings, the quality of the balance of the yarding was very plain indeed with only a few finished cattle available. 

The usual buyers attended the sale but they had great difficulty filling their orders.

The restocker steers met the usual strong enquiry to sell at unchanged rates. Heifers carrying condition were fully firm but the off type and unfinished heifers were cheaper by 2c/kg. 

Heavy steers and light bullocks were plain in quality and finish and sold up to 4c/kg cheaper. The demand was there but the supply was not.

There was no alteration in the cow price even though the quality was below the last sale. Restockers again bid on the 2 score cows.

There were not as many quality bulls yarded but they sold at cheaper rates even with the quality drop taken into account."
"It was a smaller yarding, with young cattle and cows making up the largest percentage of the numbers. Condition wise, the quality of the young cattle was plain, however most of the weaner cattle and yearlings were well-bred.  There were also larger numbers of lighter cattle offered this week.

The market was generally dearer, with restocker vealer steers selling 20c higher and topping at 330c, while restocker vealer heifers sold to a top of 265c/kg. Yearling steers to feeders and retockers met keen competition, with medium weight feeder steers selling to a top of 315c/kg. Yearling heifers were generally unchanged, although some sales struggled to hold firm as feeder heifers sold to a top of 282c/kg.

The yarding of export cattle was made up mainly of cows, along with a few pens of heifers.  There were increased numbers of 2 score cows through the sale this week. Most cows sold 17c to 20c dearer, with 2 scores selling from 187c to 231c and heavy weights topped at 256.2c/kg."
"It was a smaller yarding today at Armidale, which is usual for this time of year: the end of the sell-off period and prior to the anticipated spring flush. There were a few in each category with some good quality, well finished lots available. There was limited processor competition; however the regular restocker and feedlot orders were active.

Due to the low numbers and quality and condition variations there are not market trends available. The weaner steers averaged slightly higher. Heavy yearling feeder steers were quite a bit cheaper this week with quality and numbers a factor. Yearling heifers improved in quality and saw a price improvement.

Well finished grown heifers sold strongly with most going to feed. Cows and bulls experienced little change."
"It was a smaller market this week with the quality of the cattle fairly mixed. There were some very well finished yearlings and cows penned alongside quite a few underdone types.

The market for the trade cattle was stronger, the lighter 3 score heifers selling upto 5c a kilogram dearer with little change in the 2 score heifer yearlings. There were a few medium weight vealers penned this week and they sold at very strong rates. Yearling steers over 400 kilograms were in good supply, the market 1c dearer. Restocker steers sold on a firm market.

There were only a small number of heavy steers and bullocks on offer, quality was a little better with some being grain assisted. The quality of the cows was slightly better than last week with the majority of the cows showing a little better finish.

The quality of the heavy steers helped to create a dearer market with rises of 2c to 4c a kilogram. The strongest market of the day were the cows with buyers pushing hard to secure numbers. The better cows sold at rates 4c to 7c a kilogram dearer while the plainer cows sold 2c a kilogram dearer."
"It was a reduced penning comprising limited numbers of vealers. Yearlings and grown cattle were in fair supply, with a very good quality penning of heavy cows. There was increased export processor competition with the usual restocker and feedlot orders also in attendance. The overall quality of the offering was mixed and this was reflected in price changes.

Trends varied through the young cattle, with the limited number of vealer steers suitable to restockers selling up to 10c/kg dearer. The heavier weights to restock sold to a cheaper trend, averaging 5c/kg cheaper. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw light and medium weights mostly cheaper, down by 3c to 8c/kg. Some quality related changes were also evident. An improved quality penning of heavy feeders were quite a bit dearer, averaging as much as 21c/kg higher with much of that increase breed related. Yearling heifers to restockers sold to a dearer trend with increased competition, averages improving by 10c to 20c/kg. The well finished medium and heavy heifers attracted both trade and feedlot competition and saw improvements of 10c to 18c/kg. There was also an improvement in quality.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend with an improved quality penning. Restockers were active on the plainer condition cows, with the market up to 4c/kg dearer. The quality of the medium and heavy 3 and 4 score cows contributed to dearer prices realised on what was otherwise a firm market trend. Heavy bulls were firm with an odd slightly dearer sale on the best lots."
"It was a reduced offering with vealers making up a large percentage of the yarding, alongside cows and a few heavy steers. There was a smaller number of yearling steers. The overall quality of the offering was fair to good. The regular processors were in attendance, although there was a regular restocker order absent.

The market trend for vealer steers to restock was firm to 2c/kg dearer. Heifer vealers recovered much of the previous sale losses to record a dearer trend throughout, averaging 2c to 12c/kg dearer. The trend for yearling steers to restock and feed was firm to slightly dearer with quality related price variations evident. The trend was similar for heifer yearlings with a good selection suitable for restockers and few for the trade.

There was an increased number of heavy steers and older full mouth manufacturing steers however the market trend saw little change. Competition from restockers was strong for the plainer condition cows, particularly those joined. This demand saw the average 9c/kg dearer. Cows to processors lost ground with the trend down 2c to 4c/kg."
"It was a heavier yarding, but there were very few quality fat cattle yarded. The bulk of the yarding were weaners and yearlings, the majority of which went back to restockers. Light heifers were in fair numbers and met with mainly slaughter demand. All the regular operators attended the sale.

The market for the killable yearling and weaner cattle was cheaper by 2c/kg, but yearling steers to restockers sold at firm to slightly dearer prices.

Export and boner cattle sold well again, at values similar to recent sales, but comparisons were difficult to make due to the small yarding last week."
"Increased numbers with yearlings and cows well represented. There were a couple of pens of heavyweight steers also, carrying 4 to 6 teeth. The condition of the young cattle was more suited to restockers, with all but a small number of yearling heifers going back to the paddock. All regular processing orders were in place and restocker competition increased.

Last weeks good rain and forecasts for more put confidence in the minds of restockers, particularly those looking for steers. Most of the yearling steers fell into the lightweight class with the market showing a dearer trend, up by 15c/kg. The few heavyweights also sold to a dearer trend, up 4c/kg. Lightweights sold to a dearer trend with buyers showing little concern. Heifer yearlings to the trade sold to a cheaper trend with limited pressure from restockers, down by 14c/kg. Heifer yearlings to restockers sold to a cheaper trend, with C muscles averaging 3c cheaper and lightweight grades more.

Heavyweight steers sold to a dearer trend up 3c, with quality also improved. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend for C muscles up 5c, while the low yielding D muscles sold at cheaper rates. Restockers were active on plain condition cows carrying a large frame. Those plain condition cows not suitable to restockers sold to a cheaper trend with the better condition cows selling firm to 4c/kg cheaper."
"Increased numbers were yarded with the quality once again fair to good. Yearlings made up the bulk offered. There were a few heavy steers and a reduced offering of cows. Not all regular export buyers were in attendance, although this had little or no effect on the market.

The young cattle market was strong with restocker and feeder orders very active. Most of the young steers and some of the heifer yearlings were purchased by these orders with only the fattest heifers being purchased by the trade. Yearling steers were dearer, up 1c to 8c/kg. Heifer yearling feeders were 2c to 3c/kg dearer. Trade yearling heifers reversed the dearer trend to sell cheaper, down 2c to 4c/kg.

Restockers were active on the plainer conditioned grown steers at improved rates. The heavy steers to processors improved in quality and were mostly younger than those offered last week, this resulted in values improving by 8c to 10c/kg. Grown heifers also improved slightly. There were not as many cows penned with the market easing, down 1c to 3c/kg. Quite a number of bulls were penned and they sold firm to a shade dearer."
"Increase numbers of cattle continue to come on to the market as the dry conditions continue. There was 2,200 head yarded, an increase of 900 head. The yarding consisted mainly of yearlings, weaner cattle and cows. The yarding of young cattle consisted of a good supply of yearlings and there were several runs of well-bred weaner, and yearling steers and heifers. Quality was fairly mixed with most cattle in 2 score condition. Restocker and feeder buyers acquired most of the cattle for local and northern orders.

The market varied mainly due to quality, however restocker weaner steers held firm selling to a top of 300c, while weaner heifers topped at 236c to be down by 10c/kg. Feeder and restocker yearling steers sold firm to a dearer trend topping at 299c/kg. The heifer portion, however, were down by 10c selling to 250c/kg.

The yarding of export cattle consisted mainly of cows, with insufficient numbers of grown steers for a quote, while there was a fair penning of heifers. Heifers attracted limited interest from buyers, resulting in a drop of 20c/kg. The cow market was down by 20c, with medium and heavy cows selling from 190c to 215c/kg. There was a large percentage of plain conditioned cows and most of them sold from 120c to 190c/kg."
"Included in the yarding were 495 fat cattle, with 300 store cattle sold at the end. Yearling quality,  except for restock steers was plain only. There were no quality bullocks yarded this week and the heavy steers were mostly under finished. The cow yarding was of the usual high standard. A full field of buyers attended the sale.

Restock yearling steers sold to a dearer trend,  but the trade and light heifers were cheaper, as has been the case across the North this week.

The drop in price of heavy steers was caused by a quality reduction,  but cows and the heavy export heifers up to six tooth sold at very much dearer rates. Plenty of bulls were yarded,  and together with the few pens of feeder steers, sold at improved values."
"Included in the increased yarding were more than 650 advertised restocker cattle, many of which were sold on a dollars per head basis. Even though there were numbers of quality well fattened cattle, the average quality was below the previous sale. Cows and yearlings made up the greatest numbers, while most descriptions were represented to a varying degree. 

Market trends in young cattle varied from fully firm to cheaper in front of a full buying field. Light vealers under 200kg were fully firm as were the slightly heavier vealers, with restockers setting a strong price standard for suitable stock. Domestic feeder cattle and restocker yearling steers were firm, but plainer heifer yearlings to kill were cheaper by up to 6c/kg.  

There were just enough heavy steers and bullocks yarded to quote a firm market trend. Export feeder steers met keen competition and values were fully firm. Demand for all cows dropped sharply and prices for medium weights, which were the bulk of the offering, were cheaper by up to 15c/kg. Lighter cows were cheaper but not to the same extent. Bull prices were cheaper by an average 12c/kg.

The top sale price was 253.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight steer vealers weighing under 150kg."
"In what was the largest penning in quite some time yearlings and cows were well represented. There was a fair supply of grown steers and heifers along with the first of the early weaners. The quality of the offering was fair to very good while condition varied greatly. The regular buyers were in attendance.

Restocker demand was strong for good quality young cattle with the steer weaners selling particularly well. The heifer portion were also keenly sought. Plain quality yearling steers in all categories were harder to sell and attracted less competition than the better quality lines. Market trends were dearer through all weight classes when compared to pre Christmas levels. Heifer yearlings also attracted strong competition with demand from restocker and feedlot orders strong. Once again the better quality lines were keenly sought while secondary and plain quality heifers were discounted considerably.

A small number of well finished heavy grown steers showed strong improvement as did the well finished grown heifers purchased by processors. Processor demand for cows was very strong with market trends also showing strong gains. Heavy bulls were also dearer."
"In the largest yarding for the season,  the trend toward big numbers continues in the North for another week, at least. The fat quality of the yarding was not good, and the bulk of the offering were unfinished cows, vealers and yearlings. All the regular Buyers attended, and the market was consistent to the end.

Last week s sudden price rises were not maintained, with most young cattle averaging a 4c to 5c/kg fall. Some pens of the very best were cheaper by only 2c to 3c. Restockers buying steer weaners and yearlings, paid 4c or 5c less , this week.

Over 900 cows were yarded, most dropping up to 5c/kg, in price,  while heavy steers or bullocks were very short in number and quality, and sold from just firm to 4c/kg cheaper."
"In one of the smallest offerings for the year, quality was well below the usual standard. With the knowledge that some meatworks were closing for Christmas, many growers were hesitant to yard their stock. The yarding comprised mainly young cattle suitable for restockers, and understandably, there were very few export cattle available. 

Numbers were insufficient to attract the normal full field of buyers, and consequently, most young slaughter stock were cheaper. Restockers kept suitable cattle at a firm level. 

There were no quality heavy steers or bullocks available. Cows and heavy export weight heifers sold at fully firm rates due to the very small yarding, but the bull market was cheaper due to reduced competition.

Quality light steer vealers suitable for restocking topped the market at 230c/kg."
"In a surprising reversal of trends, the numbers increased following good rains in the previous weekend. Weaners and yearling steers bought by the feedlots were in the greatest numbers while the cows maintained their normal 33% of the offering. Trade cattle continued to be short supplied while there were a number of pens of reasonable quality bullocks yarded.

The usual fat stock and feedlot buyers attended the sale together with an increase in the numbers of restockers trying to buy grass eaters. The market varied for steer weaners with the better quality types selling at very firm rates while plainer steers sold almost up to last sale prices. Heifer vealers sold to a cheaper trend under reduced slaughter competition while the few pens bought by restockers sold at firm rates. Feeder steers sold very strongly for the considerably improved numbers and quality. Trade cattle were poorly supplied and marginally cheaper. Restocker demand increased but the difficulty that they face in both finding a suitable price and a reasonable supply continued this week. 

The bullocks were not high yielders but they sold at similar rates to recent northern sales. The cows sold at cheaper rates for slaughter cattle but any that went to restockers were fully firm in price.

The best sale price was again for a single beast at 214.2c/kg paid for a heavily boned steer weaner destined for fat stock competitions next season."
"In a similar yarding to last week, 620 mixed quality cattle were penned. There was a good offering of cows, weaners and yearling cattle, but a shortage of grown steers. Most of the regular buyers attended.

There was good restocker competition on most lines of weaners with producers buying before the end of the financial year. Yearling steers showed an upward trend to be slightly dearer while yearling heifers were also dearer.

Heavy cows were similar in value to last week, but lighter conditioned cows enjoyed an upward influence owing to increased restocker activity. Heavy bulls remained firm."
"In a similar size yarding, the quality was fair with yearling steers and heifers and cows providing the bulk of the cattle. There were a few pens of steers over 500kg, but most required more finishing. The very light vealers that have been in big numbers were not as plentiful this week. The cows yarded were fair, average quality with light cows under supplied.

The trend in the market was cheaper for almost all descriptions. The light vealers were selling at firm prices, while there were not enough shop vealers over 200kg yarded to quote a change. The weakening in a range between 3c and 6c/kg occurred across the board in yearling cattle and this included the restocker yearling steers. With the hot weather arriving, the interest in store cattle has quickly diminished.

The export cattle and heavy restocker steers also lost considerable ground with buyers sticking close to their limits at all times. The numbers of heavy, well shaped cows yarded sold at almost firm rates, but most other cows dropped up to 8c from their price to average a 5c and 6c/kg fall. The bull market was also weaker and that market has lost up to 30c/kg in the last eight weeks."
"In a combination of follow-up rain and weaners being held for special sales, the numbers finally dropped by one third. As has become the normal, there were some finished cattle in all categories, but most of the rest were plain. Weaners, plain yearlings, and light cows were the bulk of the offering. The usual Buyers were in attendance.

The market was variable, with well finished yearlings dearer firm to dearer, but the plain types in both sexes, firm to 2 cents per kilogram cheaper, and this included the restock steer weaners.

Bullocks and heavy steers were in strong demand , and sold to 7 and 8 cents per kilogram dearer, with heavy cattle proving difficult to source in Northern sales .

In keeping with a recent trend, cows with high yield, were dearer by 6 or 7 cents per kilogram. However, light cows were only firm to 2 cents dearer for the majority."
"Hot and dry conditions over the break saw an increase in numbers for the start of the selling year. All grades were represented in front of all the usual orders. The quality offered was mixed with quite a few showing the effects of the weather and feed conditions. There were some outstanding heavy cows penned. 

The market for vealers to process was significantly cheaper than the pre-Christmas level. This trend continued for steers to restock, however falls were not as great. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw little but quality related change. Heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend throughout. The least affected were the good quality well-bred light and medium weights.

Grown steers sold to a dearer trend, both to process and feed. There were obvious premiums for well finished grown cattle, both steers and heifers. The heavy cow market was strong with the best heavyweights firm to slightly dearer. Medium and lightweight cows to process sold to a cheaper trend. Restockers were active on the better quality plain condition cows."
"Handy rainfall over the Tablelands saw numbers reduce for the fortnightly sale to total 358 head. The yarding consisted mainly of weaner cattle and light yearlings, along with a few cows. Quality was fairly plain, with most young cattle in 1 and 2 score condition, however there were several lines of well bred cattle through the sale.

Restocker interest was very keen following the rain, with restocker weaner steers reaching up to 30c dearer, topping at 322c for well bred light weights, while the heifer portion sold up to 242c/kg. Feeder steers gained 12c, topping at 257c/kg. Yearling heifers were 10c to 20c dearer and more for some sales, making up to 247c/kg for restockers and feeders.

The yarding of export cattle comprised of mainly cows, along with an odd pen of grown steers and heifers. Grown steers sold up to 250c and heifers made to 245c/kg. The cow market improved by 20c to 30c/kg compared to the sale two weeks ago. Light cows made from 110c to 186c, while heavy cows sold to a top of 243c/kg. Heavy bulls topped at 248c/kg."
"Growers were reluctant to offer numbers of cattle until the market is established later in the month. Bigger numbers can therefore be expected later in the month. Quality was fair in the small offering with yearlings and cows in the greatest supply. There were only a few bullocks, heavy steers and vealers yarded, while restocker cattle numbers were limited.

Not all the regular buyers attended, as some are on annual leave and the small yarding was insufficient to attract some buyers. The market for young cattle was uneven with yearling heifers to the trade or to restockers being an average of 20c/kg cheaper. Feeder steers were firm for the few on offer, but restocker yearlings were easier as the demand weakens due to the drying feed conditions.

The best yielding cows sold at steady to slightly cheaper rates, but the plainer types were down in price by 6c/kg. Heavy weight heifers were firm as were the bulls and all other quotes were not possible, due to the lack of numbers."
"Growers were able to deliver an increased number of stock to the market following recent rain, making the numbers yarded close to a normal.The breed quality of the yarding was good with light vealers and steer and heifer weaners very much increased in numbers.Yearling heifers and steer yearlings were in fair numbers while heavy steers and bullocks were light supplied. Cows also were in lower numbers and quality than at any time in the last month.

The usual buying power was available in the market and the trend in the young cattle was towards dearer while the export cattle were firm to slightly stronger. Light vealers and heifer yearlings and some of the lightest yearling restocker steers showed a dearer tendency under very strong demand. Most of the trade heifers of medium weight and above, together with the heaviest yearling steers were fully firm. The restocker demand for any light cattle seems to strengthen at every market recently.

The bullocks on offer were not absolutely suitable for Jap ox but even so sold at a marginally dearer rate. The cow market was fully firm and there were a few pens of outstanding yield cows that sold right up to the new levels seen at sales elsewhere this week. There were also a few top yielding bulls that also sold well above recent sales due to their high yield."
"Good weekend rains together with the start of the shearing season, pulled the numbers offered back to the smallest yarding this season. The average quality was similar to the previous sale, with the values for most descriptions firm to 2 cents dearer, under the same field of Buyers. Demand for restock cattle remains strong, however, supply is limited. For the first time in more recent years, there were no cows yarded."
"Good recent rain with another forecast on the way resulted in a drop odd in numbers. This forcing sales back to a fortnightly basis for the forseeable future.  The quality and condition of the offering was generally plain. There was a reduced presence of processors, however restockers were active in all categories.

Despite the limited supplies market trends were generally dearer through all of the young cattle categories. Light weight vealer steers to restockers were as much as 46c/kg dearer. A plain quality penning of light weight yearling steers experienced strong gains taking quality into account. The heifer portion followed a similar trend.

Lightly muscled grown heifers suitable to feed sold to much dearer trends. Strong restocker activity on the plain condition cows saw them dearer with some improvement in quality. The reduced processor competition impacted the bull market."
"Good rainfall over the whole district in the past few days reduced numbers this week. The quality of the offering was fair to good. There were good numbers of well bred weaners on offer as the selling season gets underway. There were also some well finished heavy steers and a number of pens of well finished high yielding cows.

As to be expected with the good rains on top of a fair season on the tablelands the market was dearer throughout all grades of young cattle. Restockers were very active on weaner steers and the light yearling steers to show rises of 4c to 21c/kg depending on quality. The heifer weaners also saw prices rise by 20c/kg under restocker competition. The light and medium weight heifer vealers to the trade were 5c/kg dearer. Medium and heavy yearling steers were dearer by 4c to 10c/kg. Yearling heifers to both processors and feedlotters met stronger competiton and sold 5c to 8c/kg dearer.

A better quality offering of grown steers sold dearer, up 6c to 8c/kg. The grown heifers remained unchanged. Restockers were active on the plainer conditioned light and medium weight cows resulting in price rises of 10c to 20c/kg. The medium and heavy cows to processors under spirited bidding at times saw prices 2c to 9c/kg dearer."
"Good rainfall over the past week reduced the penning substantially. There were limited supplies in each category, however grown cattle made up a good percentage. The quality of the offering was very mixed, while the majority of the well finished cattle were in the older categories. There was restricted processor and feedlot attendance with restockers active throughout.

There was high restocker demand for all weight classes of vealer and yearling steers. This resulted in dearer trends throughout. Light and medium weight yearling heifers also sold to dearer trends. Heavy weights to restock and feed saw cheaper trends with quality impacting some price change.

Well finished heavy weight grown steers sold to a much cheaper trend under restricted processor competition. This trend flowed into the well finished grown heifers to process. A small number to restockers were dearer in places. The cow market was also cheaper as a result of the limited processor competition. Restockers were active on the plainer condition lots. The bull market was also cheaper with restricted competition. Stags were included in this category and boosted prices in places.

Market reporter,  James Armitage"
"Good rainfall of between 50mm and 100mm saw cattle numbers yarded drop. The quality of the offering was mixed and condition through all grades varied. There were some very good cows penned and a number of reasonably well finished yearling heifers although they were not quite as good as the previous sale. All regular buyers were in attendance as well as one that had been absent for a few weeks.

The young cattle market showed some variation. A line of calves sold to processors at strong rates. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders sold firm to cheaper, with quality showing quite a large variation. Lightweight heifer yearlings to restockers attracted good competition and sold to a dearer trend with odd sales showing improvement. Trade yearling heifers sold at cheaper rates with quality accounting for the fall in value.

The quality of the heavyweight steers offered was the reason behind a firm to cheaper market trend. The better quality grown heifers sold to a slightly cheaper trend, while the lightweight D muscles showing sufficient finish were a little dearer. The cow offering improved in quality overall with this helping to improve averages on medium weights in an otherwise firm market while heavyweight 4 score cows eased by 4c/kg."
"Good overnight storm rain had little affect on the numbers as all cattle were yarded before the rain fell. The quality of the yarding was plain with yearlings in the greatest numbers but the majority of them were light conditioned. There were a few pens of high quality bullocks and cows offered but the balance of the penning were below a average quality.

The regular orders were represented and there was a stronger enquiry for restocking cattle as a result of the overnight rainfalls. Feeder heifers sold at fully firm to slightly dearer rates, while restocker steers were 3c/kg dearer. There were basically no trade cattle yarded. Lightweight vealers sold strongly, gaining the benefit of added competition from both wholesalers and restockers.

Export cattle met a keener enquiry and bullocks, the best cows and export weight heifers met an increased market. Heavier feeder steers sold at firm rates even though quality was down, and the bull price rose by 3c/kg."
"Good falls of rain through the Tablelands over the past week resulted in the number of cattle yarded nearly halved.  Restocker and feeder steers and yearling heifers were well supplied, while there was only an odd pen of grown steers and a much smaller penning of cows and an odd vealer through the sale.

Quality was fair with some well-finished cattle and well bred steers offered.  Restocker demand was strong for well-bred cattle, while feeder steers sold to a cheaper trend.  Trade yearling steers were in limited numbers and sold according to quality.  The better end of the yearling heifers was 6c cheaper while the lighter heifers sold up to 12c/kg dearer.

The light penning of grown steers consisted only of a few pens of well-finished steers, which sold to a cheaper market however, feeders helped to keep the plainer steers up in value.   The smaller penning of cows continued to regain some lost ground to sell firm to slightly dearer.

A pen of 20 very light restocker weaner steers toped the sale at 229.2c/kg."
"Going against the trend of the week, a larger numbers were penned. The majority of the offering were lightweight young cattle with no heavy grown steers and a limited number of cows. All regular buyers were in attendance for an offering where restockers were well catered for.

Young cattle sold to a dearer trend. Heifer vealers both to processors and to restockers were 6c/kg dearer. Light weight yearling steers in good numbers sold to restockers at dearer rates, averaging 11c/kg dearer. Included were lines of light weight weaned steers. Medium weight steers attracted strong restocker demand to be 9c to 16c/kg dearer. The limited numbers of heavy yearling steers suitable to feedlots also sold to a dearer trend. Heifer yearlings sold dearer by 1c to 3c/kg.

Grown heifers sold firm to dearer. The cow market also showed strong gains in the medium and heavy well finished categories with the top price of 154.2c/kg for a pen that included some 7 tooth cattle. Restockers were once again active on plainer condition cows."
"Further heavy frost during the week has further depleted feed stocks and therefore increased yarding sizes. Quality was very plain indeed with over 600 cattle either light heifer yearlings or plain bred restocker yearling steers. There were very few fat cattle of any description and with the season it is unlikely that any will be yarded in the near future. Cows were in light numbers and most were very plain in condition. Bulls were in some numbers and there were not enough grown steers yarded to quote a market.

There was some weakening in the young cattle market with yearling heifers at any weight 4c to 5c/kg cheaper. The exceptions were a few trade heifers that sold at relatively firm rates.  The best quality restocker yearling steers were met with less demand to record a cheaper trend. The plainer bred restocker steers which were mostly D muscle sold at firm prices as growers sought to buy numbers at the expense of breed quality. 

Restockers were interested in some of the light conditioned cows showing in calf and generally light cows showed a small price gain. The better cows sold at firm prices, as did the bulls."
"Further good falls of rain were responsible for a continuation of smaller yardings as some growers held cattle hoping for a price rise. Quality was fair only. Yearlings and light vealers were in fair supply, but all other descriptions were short supplied.

Values for all young cattle were firm or dearer. The usual regular buyers attended. Light vealers sold at fully firm prices either to slaughter or to restockers. Quality trade yearlings sold at firm rates with demand exceeding supply. A feature of the sale was the increased numbers of restockers attempting to buy lightweight cattle.

Heavy steers and bullocks sold at firm prices. Demand for cows increased due to a shortage of supply and prices were 3c to 5c/kg dearer. Heavy export heifers met keen enquiry to maintain last sale rates. Bulls were of plain quality and low in yield but sold at firm prices.

 A wholesaler paid the top sale price of 247.2c/kg for a pen of light steer vealers."
"For the last sale for the year on the Armidale calendar, numbers were steady and quality was fair to good. There were good pens of quality heavy young cows which attracted attention as well as heavy numbers of restocker and trade heifer yearlings. Bullocks were only offered in single lots while feeder yearlings were good quality and in fair supply.

A full field of buyers saw one of the strongest markets of the season with restocker yearlings, trade heifers and feeder cattle, all averaging 8c/kg dearer. Demand for restocker yearlings was almost at a peak for the season with restockers lacking any further chance to buy cattle now until early January. 

There were insufficient bullocks to quote a market, but export heifers sold to a dearer set of values. The demand for the good pens of stylish heavy cows was extremely strong with cow prices peaking at a 20c/kg rise, and averaging 16c/kg increases. Bulls also sold at dearer rates."
"Following the trend sales earlier in the week, there was a reduction in numbers. Vealers and yearlings were well supplied. There was a fair supply of cows, however there were limited numbers of well finished grown steers and heifers. It was a very mixed quality offering, and this was reflected in the price change columns. Well bred young cattle stood out, with a number of lines of very well bred light weight vealers and medium and heavy weight yearlings. The usual buyers were in attendance and there was extra restocker competition.

There was high demand and strong restocker competition through the young cattle, focused mainly on those well bred lines. Market trends were dearer for restocker cattle, however feeder steers and heifers saw some quality related price decreases recorded. There was an increase from 70c to 80c in the vealer steers to restockers, however the market trend was 40c/kg dearer. This was mainly from local restockers buoyed by some very useful rainfall. Heifer vealers returning to the paddock also sold to dearer trends, however those to the trade sold to cheaper trends. Light weight yearling steers, very mixed in quality and condition, sold to dearer trends to restockers. The medium and heavy weight steers to feed sold to cheaper trends, with some quality related change. A strong restocker order put some breed specific sales to a higher level. The good quality yearling heifers to feed remained firm, however the lessor quality lots sold firm to cheaper.

Well finished heavy grown steers and heifers saw little change. The cow market was dearer throughout, with the well finished heavy weights improving by up to 20c/kg. The heavy bull market was significantly cheaper."
"Following the rain the numbers seem to have settled into pattern which may set the pace for the next weeks. Quality of the yarding did not improve and almost half the offering were store or slaughter cows. Included in the cows were 160 station bred beefmaker cows most of which went to restockers to fatten. The balance of the yarding were very light heifer or steer vealers and a good number of very light yearling heifers and steers. Heavy steers and bullocks were in small numbers and trade cattle and heavy heifers were short supplied.

Once again the market for young and light cattle escalated and this has been the trend each week as the light rain continues each week. Light splitters and yearling cattle to slaughter all showed a considerable price rise following the trend in other northern sales early in the week. The restocker yearling cattle again displayed appreciable price rises and restocker demand is increasing particularly for lightweight cattle as the prospect of fresh green feed is also increasing following light rain.

Heavy steers and bullocks were in keen demand but it seems that those descriptions are not available in the area at this time. The slaughter cow market was close to as strong as it has been with the better yield cows rising in price up to 10% under very keen bidding. The lighter cows were also dearer but did not rise to the same extent. The store and light cows offered sold at prices not seen in these yards in recent times Restocker demand pushed prices to a new level but it should be noted that the cows were ideal for fattening or breeding on."
"Following good rain over the 6 week layoff between sales the numbers were well down. The first of the weaners were penned along with a good supply of yearlings and cows. Quite a few at the heavier end of the weight classes. The quality of the offering was generally good with the majority of the cattle presenting in good condition. There was a full field of buyers in attendance including some extra orders.

Demand for young cattle was very strong through all classes and categories. Restockers and feedlots competed strongly on the medium and heavy weight young cattle while restockers showed a confidence in the market going forward by bidding strongly on the lighter weights. All young cattle sold to dearer trends with most showings significant improvement. The yearling heifers posted some of the greater increases.

Processors also competed strongly for the well finished grown cattle with both the steers and heifers showing strong improvement. There was increased competition from feedlotters on suitable lines. It was a very good quality penning of well finished cows with the market much dearer and in line with whatâ€™s been happening elsewhere. There was increased competition from processors on bulls with substantially dearer prices achieved."
"Following a three week break in sales,  numbers showed little change. All categories were represented. The quality of the offering was quite mixed with small lines of good quality cattle along with secondary grades. The condition of the penning was mostly good, a reflection of the very good seasonal conditions. The regular processors were in attendance. Both restock and feedlot activity was high.

Comparing the market to the previous sale vealers returning to the paddock experienced strong gains. There was little change in the market for medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed, quality accounting for some price change. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed met with keen demand to show a significantly dearer market trend.

Grown steers over 500kg posted strong gains and included some milk tooth lots. The well finished heavy steers to processors also sold on a much dearer market trend. It was a strong market for well finished grown heifers with both processors and feedlotters competing on suitable lines. The cow market was slightly dearer with some very good cows available along with some showing an excess of condition."
"Following a 3 week break in sales the numbers increased from the small rain reduced penning. All categories were represented with cows well supplied. The quality and condition of the offering was mixed. There was a small gallery of buyers and onlookers in attendance.

Strong demand from restockers saw the limited supply of vealers sell to a dearer trend than the previous sale. There was limited competition from restockers and feedlots for the medium and heavy weight yearling steers with these classes selling to cheaper trends. This was also the case for the medium and heavy weight yearling heifers.

Grown steers to feed were cheaper than the previous sale factoring in breed and quality along with the limited competition. Well finished grown steers and heifers to process sold to cheaper trends. The cow market showed a cheaper trend throughout. There were a couple of strong restocker orders in play in the medium and heavy weight bulls. Trends cheaper on those to process.

Market reporter; James Armitage."
"Following 65mm of rain in the immediate area the numbers remained fairly stable but the quality was quite plain with the exception of just a few lots. Yearlings steers and cows were in the greatest numbers with just a few bullocks and trade cattle yarded. Light vealers under 200kg were also yarded in fair numbers. There were much greater numbers of bulls available but they lacked quality and yield.

As was expected, the big rains across the north have restricted numbers available and the result is a dearer market. There were plenty of young cattle in the market that sold to 10c to 12c dearer with a reasonable average rise estimated at close to 10c/kg. The demand for all cattle was predictably quite extreme.

Some of the bigger price rises were reserved for the export type cattle with bullocks making 10c and 12c/kg dearer. Quality and yield was not at the best making the price rises a little more than they would appear to be. There was a very strong demand for all classes of cows with some showing up to 14c improvement and the average rise at close to 10c/kg. With plenty of water about in most northern areas it would seem that supplies of any cattle may well be restricted for some weeks."
"Following 23mm of welcomed rain, the yarding was reduced down to less than half the normal. Quality was very plain with most of the yarding being light conditioned yearlings suitable for restockers or the light veal trade. There was a small offering of cows and plain older steers, but no bullocks were available.

Demand for all cattle was strong even though not all the regular buyers attended. The pick of the restocker cattle for quality, sold at 15c/kg dearer, while the plainer types were fully firm. Slaughter yearlings were limited to only a few small lots.

There was no quote for heavy steers or bullocks due to the lack of numbers. Restockers bought older steers in plain condition at firm rates. Demand for the few available cows was very keen, with prices above the level of last sale.

Top price of the day was 245.2c/kg paid by a restocker for light yearling steers weighing 211kg."
"Female cattle dominated the total yarding with yearlings, cows and grown heifers well supplied. There were very few well finished grown steers penned and the quality of the steers going back to the paddock was below last week. There were some good lines of yearling steers penned, although the majority lacked growth for age. This is not uncommon given the tough seasonal conditions experienced through the winter. Not all regular buyers were in attendance.

Restocker orders continue to dominate the yearling cattle market, particularly the steer grades. Lightweight yearling steers met keen demand selling firm to dearer, up 4c/kg regardless of muscle score. The medium weight grades remained firm. Despite all regular buyers not being in attendance, lightweight heifer yearlings sold to a dearer trend, up 8c to 10c/kg. The 3 score trade heifers remained firm, as did restocker heifer yearlings.

The few well finished heavy steers remained firm, while the grown steers going to restockers sold to a cheaper trend, down 7c to 12c/kg with a drop in quality also a contributing factor. Grown heifers sold firm to cheaper with some price falls as much as 15c/kg. The cow market saw restocker cows sell firm to 1c dearer with the better medium and heavy cows sell firm to 1c/kg cheaper."
"Falls of rain on the Tablelands resulted in a smaller yarding. Quality continued to be plain with the exception of an odd pen of well-finished cattle. Light, young weaner cattle and vealers made up a big percentage of the yarding with an odd pen of grown steers and heifers, while there was a small supply of cows.  

The market continued to strengthen with best of the light veal selling strong and the restocker weaner and yearling steers met strong competition from both restockers and feeder buyers.  The limited supply of prime trade cattle sold to a dearer trend however, not to the extent of the plainer grades.

The yarding of export cattle consisted of a few pens of well-finished steers, although heifers were in lighter numbers. Cow numbers were down again with a fair percentage being of very plain quality and showing the effects of the dry weather. Demand was strong for the steers and heifers while cow prices were up to 10c/kg dearer.

The top price of the sale was for a lightweight vealer heifer at 157.6c/kg."
"Falls of 30 to 50mm of rain decimated cattle numbers to produce one of the smallest yarding in well over twelve months. The bulk of the cattle were yearlings, mainly suitable for restockers. There were a few pens of yearling trade heifers, limited numbers of cows, and no heavy steers, bullocks or feeder steers.

The excellent fall of rain had an immediate affect on most prices with restocker cattle varying between 4c and 20c/kg dearer under intense competition. Trade weight heifers sold strongly to record a considerable price improvement. 

Export heifer values increased by up to 8c/kg but there was no heavy steer quotes possible. The cows of all weights and condition sold up to the strongest market rate of the current season, while bulls sold at firm rates.

The top sale price was 250.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight steer weaners."
"Except for a few top pens, quality was fairly plain with most cattle showing the effects of winter. All the usual buyers attended the sale with restockers very strong on the lighter end resulting in a stronger market for most grades.

Most of the vealer steers and all the heifers went back to the paddock to restock with most yearling steers to restockers or feeder orders at similar rates to last sale with most of the heifers going to slaughter at slightly dearer rates.

Steer and bullock quality slipped, however rates improved by up to 6c/kg in places, while cows also sold to a dearer trend.

The top price was 229c/kg for light vealer steers."
"Even though there was a reduction in numbers, the overall quality of the yarding showed improvement, as a better offereing cows and trade heifers were available. All the regular operators attended.There are still a number of very plain, light yearling cattle coming on to the market, an unusual trend considering the feed situation in the area.

The market was very solid for all descriptions with no obvious alteration in price for any description. The higher prices received for some heifers and restocker steer yearlings are a reflection of a quality improvement, rather than an actual price change.

The winter and spring yardings have been very plain in fat quality, however some of the cattle off pastured country are now starting to come forward."
"Even though the yarding was halved, the numbers were respectable for a long weekend. Quality for most, was fairly plain, but there were some good pens of trade heifers and restock steers and steer weaners. Cows were the dominant numbers.

With a number of Northern sales cancelled this week, buyers were looking for a few killable cattle for Tuesday. As a result, some of the better trade types sold to a dearer trend of 1 or 2c/kg. Restockers were keen, and provided a fully firm market for yearling steers and weaner steers.

Steers were only 3 score, but firm, while cows sold from 1 to 3c/kg cheaper, but under the usual buying strength."
"Even after the good rains over the weekend the numbers offered came back to normal. The quality of the yarding was well ahead of last weeks small sale with particular emphasis on the restocker weaners and yearling steers. There was an obvious shortage of heavy steers, bullocks and cows with the same shortages noted in other northern sales this week. There was no shortage of buyers on either fat cattle or on the big numbers of weaner and yearling steers available.

The market was particularily strong on weaners, heifer veal, yearling steers and trade heifers with the market displaying a dearer tendency varying between 4c and 10c/kg for these types. A feature in the sale was the sustained demand for well bred steer weaners and yearling steers with the demand coming from , in some cases, areas well away from the Tablelands.

The few heavy steers and light bullocks available stayed at last sale rates with quality not at particularly high levels. The better cows showing yield potential sold at 3 to 4 c/kg dearer with buyers unable to satisfy the demand for these better types."
"Easter was the reason for the small yarding but numbers are expected to return to normal next week.

There were no vealers in the market because of the need to carry them over to next week.The yarding consisted mainly of fair to good quality yearling steers and a few pens of yearling heifers to the trade. Export cattle were fairly plain quality and in small numbers.

Not all buyers were in attendance other than the restockers who were very prominent on the good numbers of yearling steers.

Export cattle in both heavy steers and cows, and due to the reduced competition, were cheaper by 2c to 4c/kg.

All yearlings, either steers of heifers, sold at the same rates as last sale with buyers needing to obtain cattle for the Tuesday morning kill."
"Dry weather forced increased numbers on to the market with the yarding almost doubling.  Light yearlings made up a large percentage of the yarding, while there were increased numbers of calves, but only a few vealers and a fair penning of grown cattle was offered.  The quality of the young cattle was plain with large numbers of light 1 and 2 score yearling steers and heifers offered, however there was also a few pens of better quality cattle offered that went to feeders and restockers. 

The market was generally firm with the restockers purchasing according to quality as rain commenced falling as the sale started.  The small number of yearlings that went to the trade were fully firm as were the vealer portion.  The better bred and quality cattle attracted the keenest interest. 

The yarding of export cattle consisted of a small penning of grown steers, while grown heifers and cows were in fair numbers.  Grown steers and heifers remained firm, while the cow market was firm to slightly dearer."
"Deteriorating seasonal conditions saw numbers increase quite a bit. The condition of the offering was mostly plain with limited numbers of well finished cattle suitable to the processors. The quality was fair. Market trends varied with quality playing its part, particularly in the young cattle.

Vealers, both steers to restockers and heifers to the trade sold to a cheaper trend. Yearling steers to restockers and feeders in all weight classes sold firm to slightly cheaper with the better quality C muscle grades least affected. Lightweight yearling heifers in fresh condition sold to the trade at slightly dearer rates, while those lacking bloom sold to restockers at cheaper rates. The medium and heavyweight trade yearling heifers sold firm to cheaper.

Feeder steers sold firm, while heavyweight grown steers sold to a cheaper trend. Grown heifers saw the quality of the C muscle grades improve with the market improving as a result. The cow market was firm to cheaper throughout in what was a generally plain quality and condition offering.

There were some plain condition cattle in the offering, which was  sold on a dollar per head basis including cows and calves and lightweight yearling cattle."
"Despite very good and timely rainfalls the numbers almost doubled. Yearlings made up two thirds of the overall number. The quality of the offering was very mixed, as was condition. There was a fair supply of crop fed yearlings alongside quite a few showing the effects of the Winter conditions. Most of the usual processors were in attendance and the extra numbers enabled more to operate. Restockers and feedlot buyers were active on young cattle.

Market trends varied through the young cattle and quality variations did affect price change. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend, however breed quality was a factor in the cheaper prices. Yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend, with restocker demand high. Processors competed strongly for the well finished crop fed lines and there was extra competition. Quality lifted significantly and was reflected in some of the price changes. There were a number of pens of plain quality light weight yearlings that attracted strong restocker competition.

There was little change in the market for the few heavy steers, with the same trend for grown heifers. The cow market was firm to slightly cheaper with some quality variation. An extra buyer in the bull market saw the trend dearer."
"Despite upwards of 100mm of rain since the last sale, numbers increased. All grades were well represented in a fair to good quality offering. There were double the number of cows penned with the quality also showing a marked improvement. All regular buyers were in attendance and operating.

The good rain and supply issues drove the market with most young cattle showing a firm to dearer trend. There were odd grades that were not quite up to last weeks values, although quality issues were the cause. Vealer steers to restockers sold at unchanged rates. Light heifer vealers were well sought by processors, showing a dearer trend, up 15c to 20c/kg.

Once again most yearling steers were purchased by restockers and feedlot interests at firm rates. This was the case through all weight ranges. Heifer yearlings followed a similar trend to both the trade and feedlots. There were some quality issues in the trade heifers that saw some averages lose value. Restockers showed interest in the plainer heifers at slightly improved rates.

There were increased numbers of grown steers, although quite a number lacked sufficient condition for processors. Those which sold to processors did so at rates firm to slightly cheaper with quality also a factor. Restockers and feedlots were active on the plainer conditioned steers, although there was little change in the market trend. An improved quality offering of cows met keen demand from processors with the market trend 1c to 4c/kg dearer for the best medium and heavyweight cows. Restockers were also active on plainer conditioned cows at increased rates."
"Despite the very good recent rains, numbers doubled. Vealers were in large numbers and cows were well supplied. Most of the regular processors were in attendance, with restocker and feeder competition buoyant. Demand from all sectors was high and dearer trends were seen through all categories.

Vealer steers attracted very strong demand to show a dearer trend of 20c to 25c/kg, regardless of weight or breed quality. The dearer trend continued through heifer vealers to restock, with demand for all weight and muscle scores. The trend was up by 15c to 18c/kg. The majority of the yearling steers fell into the lightweight class, with a small number of medium weights. The trend for these cattle was dearer by 20c/kg, with an isolated sale showing a greater increase. The trend was the same for yearling heifers however the price increase was not as great. Well finished heifers suitable to the trade attracted keen demand.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. The cow market saw dearer trends throughout and the quality of the well finished heavy weights was better. Those heavy cows improved by 9c to 15c/kg. The plain condition cows were also dearer, although the increase was not as great and there were some quality related price variations also."
"Despite the good seasonal conditions, the record temperatures during the week brought forward double the numbers. All grades were represented in what was a mixed quality and condition offering. There were quite a few well finished high yielding cows as well as some very well finished heifer yearlings. Throughout all categories restockers and feedlots were well catered for with plenty of plain quality and condition cattle.

The increased numbers brought with it some quality related price variations. Young cattle saw a cheaper market for the most part with some exceptions. Yearling steers to restock and feed sold firm to 10c/kg cheaper, some of the fall was breed quality. Vealers also sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 6c/kg. Heifer yearlings experienced a variable market with light weight trade selling to a cheaper trend, while those to restockers sold firm to 4c/kg dearer and more in place. This was particularly evident on lightweight, lightly muscled lots. The 3 score heifers to the trade remained firm.

The grown steer offering were mostly plain quality with a limited number of heavy steers available. Those offered sold at comparable rates to recent sales. Grown heifers remained unchanged. Heavy cows sold up to 4c/kg dearer although the increase in yield accounted for this. The balance of the cows sold firm to slightly cheaper both to process and to restock."
"Despite some good recent rain and forecasts for more to come, there was an increase in numbers. Plain quality and condition young cattle were well supplied, an indication that producers are looking to take advantage of the currently stronger market rather than try to improve condition through the summer months. There were some very good quality heavy grown heifers and cows penned, although there were limited numbers of good quality heavy steers. Demand from a full field of buyers was strong, resulting dearer trends through most categories.

Restockers were active on light and medium weight young cattle, with a preference for the better quality lots, regardless of weight and muscle score. Light weight yearling steers were up 5c to 10c/kg. Some of the very plain quality steers were cheaper. Feeder orders were after weight, although there were few from the previous sale to compare to. Heifer yearlings sold to a dearer trend, with not a lot of change experienced on the better C muscle lots, while the plainer D muscled light weights were up to 7c/kg dearer. There were too few suitable to the trade to quote. There were some quality related price changes.

The very small number of heavy grown steers sold to a slightly dearer trend. Heavy weight well finished grown heifers sold strongly to export processors. Heifers suitable to feed and carrying only 2 teeth attracted good demand to show strong price gains. The cow market was firm to dearer, with lesser quality cows selling firm on the previous weekâ€™s top price of 164c/kg."
"Despite rainfall upwards of 125mm over the past fortnight, numbers increased. The condition of the offering was fairly plain with only a few cows and grown heifers carrying much condition. There were some good quality yearling cattle, although they were mostly lightweight with little condition. Also included in the offering were quite a lot of plain quality cattle. The return of a regular commission buyer brought some extra restocker and processor competition on light cattle.

The market responded to the rain with restocker cattle well supported. Yearling steers sold to a dearer trend, up 4c to 10c/kg. Once again buyers concentrated on weight when purchasing. Very light heifer yearlings to the trade benefited from the extra processor competition, dearer by 2c to 15c/kg. Restockers were also active on light heifers, firm to 6c/kg dearer.

There were no heavy steers penned, most of the older steers plain conditioned lightweights. Restockers and feeders were active, resulting in a dearer trend, firm to 10c dearer on lightweights and 8c/kg dearer for the few heavy weights, quality also improved. There were quite good numbers of older heifers in the offering, they were 10c to 15c dearer for C muscle grades and 5c/kg dearer for the D muscle grades. 

Good numbers of cows met strong competition. Plainer condition cows attracted restocker interest as well. Restocker cows sold firm to slightly dearer, although the quality was not up to last week. Cows to processors improved. Medium weights were 7c to 8c dearer with the heavy cows 4c/kg dearer."
"Despite missing a week due to the public holiday, the numbers remained steady. There were quite a few well finished yearlings, vealers and grown cattle reflecting what has been a very good season through parts of the district. Both restockers and feedlotters were also well catered for with large numbers of light and medium weight young cattle. There was extra processor and feedlot participation on top of a full field of the regular buyers. Demand was strong from all sectors.

Comparing the market to the previous sale 2 weeks ago, restockers were very active on all classes of light weight young cattle. Steer weaners experienced strong price gains, while the heifer portion were up to 18c/kg dearer. Yearling steers and all weight ranges saw a dearer trend of 3c to 7c/kg, with this improvement experienced across all quality grades. An improved quality penning of yearling heifers saw significant price improvement, with breed contributing.

Heavy grown steers to process sold to a dearer trend of 10c to 12c/kg with increased competition. The well finished grown heifers saw similar price improvement for the same contributing factor. Well finished medium and heavy weight cows sold to a dearer trend of 3c to 4c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to a cheaper trend with the quality also not as good."
"Despite heavy falls of rain on the Tablelands the last couple of days there was an increase in the number of cattle yarded.  Yearlings were well supplied and there was a good yarding of grown cattle. Quality of the young cattle was mixed with some well finished cattle offered however, there was several lots of plainer grades through the sale.

Competition was very strong from restockers, buying any cattle that were not finished enough for the trade. There was some good runs of well bred yearling steers and heifers acquired by restockers with feeder buyers being out bid on many lines.  

The yarding of export cattle consisted of a fair penning of grown steers, while heifers were well supplied and there was a good yarding of cows. Quality of the grown heifers and cows was good with a large percentage showing good yield and weight. Grown steers saw little change while heifers gained 5c to 6c and the cow market improved by 4c to 6c/kg."
"Despite follow-up rain there was an increased supply. Weaners, yearlings and cows well supplied, however there were insufficient well finished heavy grown steers and heifers to quote. Quality was generally good. Condition through the young cattle was best suited to restock and feed orders with limited numbers suitable to the trade. There were some very good cows available for processors, while restockers were also catered for with a number of pens of plainer condition cows.

Increased restocker confidence and a good quality offering of weaners resulted in dearer trend of 13c to 30c/kg for medium and heavy weight steers. There was little in the way of breed related discounting. There were strong gains also for heifer weaners to restock. Medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, with significant price improvement on a better quality penning. Heavy yearling feeder steers were slightly cheaper on average with breed related price variations. Select breeds attracted premiums above last weekâ€™s prices. Yearling heifers to feed saw increased competition translate in to a dearer trend for medium weights, up to 16c/kg. Heavy weights were firm to slightly dearer.

Strong demand from both processors and restockers resulted in dearer trends through the cow market. The well finished heavy weights were mostly 10c/kg dearer with a small number of better quality high yielding cows showing stronger gains. The plainer condition cows to process were up to 14c dearer, while those to restockers benefitted from extra competition to record significant price improvement. Heavy bulls sold to a slightly cheaper trend, down 2c to 6c/kg."
"Despite beneficial rainfall over the past 2 weeks, there was an increase in numbers. Young cattle made up the bulk of the offering, with cows also in fair numbers. The condition of the offering was plain for the most part and quality was very mixed. The usual processors were operating, however there were very few cattle to suit. Restocker influence was very high.

Demand for cattle returning to the paddock increased dramatically, with little regard shown for quality or condition. Weight also played little part in decisions. Market trends through the vealer and yearling cattle were much dearer, with some extreme sales recorded. They were not back to the high levels of the past, although some sales were not far off. The better quality yearling steers trended as much as 20c/kg dearer. The better quality yearling heifers suitable to feed were as much as 40c/kg dearer.

There were no heavy grown steers to quote. The limited supply of grown heifers suitable to the trade were up to 6c/kg dearer. Demand for cows was high from both restockers and processors, with the market showing dearer trends of as much as 30c to 40c/kg. There was reduced competition for bulls, although the market showed a dearer trend increasing up to 5c/kg."
"Despite a week off from selling there was only a small increase in numbers. Most grades were represented, however young cattle made up the bulk offered. Quality was mixed and there were a few more well finished yearlings and cows penned. There was a limited buying group in attendance with restockers active.

Comparing to the sale 2 weeks ago restocker cattle were dearer and in some cases substantially higher. Lightweight vealer and yearling steers to restockers were up 20c to 30c/kg, with a specialised order contributing greatly. Heifer yearlings to restock also sold to a dearer trend. Trade yearlings also sold to a dearer trend, up 5c on well finished medium weight heifers and up to 17c/kg for heavy steers. 

Grown cattle sold to a dearer trend with heavy steers up 13c/kg. Quality contributed to the higher prices seen for cows on a firm to slightly dearer market trend."
"Despite a very good start to spring with the promise of further pasture growth the numbers showed an increase. Producers are opting to sell regardless of whether they have been able to finish stock off or not. All regular buyers were in attendance for an offering that saw quality fair to good and condition only average.

Yearlings made up 60% of the offering, with limited numbers suitable for the trade. The majority of the steer lines went to restockers with quite a few heifers also going that way. Most of the yearlings going to the trade were heifers. The yearling steers to restockers sold firm to dearer in the main. The heifer grades sold to a cheaper trend throughout, both trade and restocker orders.

The grown cattle market eased through most grades, the only exception being the best of the grown heifers, they remained firm. Heavyweight steers suffered for quality also with the market trend up to 13c cheaper. The lessor quality grown heifers were up to 10c cheaper while the cow market saw falls of 12c to 20c/kg throughout. The bull also sold to a cheaper trend."
"Despite a forecast for rain, numbers increased. There were not many well finished yearlings in the penning with the majority 2 scores. Cows made up almost 50% of the yarding with most falling into the heavyweight range. Most regular processors were in attendance and there were more restocker orders active.

The hint of a rain event had an immediate effect on the yearling steer market especially the lightweights as they sold to a dearer trend of values up to 20c/kg higher. The medium weight grades sold to a firm trend. The heifer yearlings were slightly plainer in quality and condition and the market showed a cheaper trend of 2c to 6c/kg down.

There were insufficient grown steers and heifers for a market quote. The cow offering saw a very good run of heavy cows penned. The market saw some variation with plain light cows selling to a cheaper trend, down 6c to 8c/kg. The medium and heavyweight grades on the back of a quality improvement sold at rates firm to 2c/kg dearer."
"Despite a drop in numbers, levels are above what would normally be expected at this time of year as producers continue to offload in the face of a cold winter. Temperatures were reflected in the condition of the yarding with the majority showing signs of slipping. There were, however, a few well finished cattle put forward off crop. All regular buyers were in attendance. The market quote was firm to cheaper throughout.

It's difficult to sell to restockers when there is still frost on the ground. This resulted in a cheaper market trend for the few restocker vealer steers penned, a slight lift in quality holding averages up. Heifer vealers to kill remained unchanged. Trade and restocker yearlings remained firm for the best, while the balance saw values cheaper, down 3c to 6c/kg.

There were a few good heavy steers offered. The market was firm with the younger milk and 2 tooth steers seeing the best rates. Grown heifers also remained steady, an odd sale 2c/kg dearer. The cow market eased, falling yields and a strong dollar value certainly having an effect. Light cows were down 7c to 10c, while the medium and heavy weight grades were down 6c to 8c/kg."
"Cows made up a big percentage of the yarding ranging in condition from very plain to well finished for a few of the better pens.

The steer yearlings were in fair numbers and generally in plain condition with some well bred lines available and all went back to the paddock to restocker orders. Yearling heifer quality and condition was much plainer than the previous sale. The market trend was cheaper with the exception being restocker steers and a handy run of bulls, which sold near enough to firm under strong competition. The drop in condition of the trade heifers was partly responsible for the cheaper trend of 8c to 10c with the plainer end to 15c/kg cheaper.

There were no grown steers or bullocks to quote, while cows eased 10c to 15c/kg under softer competition.

The bet price on the day was paid for two handy bulls at 152c/kg."
"Consignments remained steady with the offering comprising large numbers of light weight young cattle. There were limited supplies of medium and heavy weight cattle penned. Overall the quality of the penning was very mixed and there were limited supplies of well finished stock available. The usual processor and feedlot buyers were in attendance, and there was strong restocker demand. There was increased restocker competition from the far north and west, brought out by the widespread rain, and the need to fill paddocks with cattle.

The light weight young cattle representing lower dollar per head values generally sold to dearer trends, with some price improvements inflated when taking quality into account. Weaner and yearling steers saw the trend 2c to 10c/kg dearer, with the heifer portion firm for weaners and up to 12c/kg dearer for the light weight heifer yearlings. Medium and heavy yearling feeder steers saw the benefit of extra competition to sell to a dearer trend. Yearling heifers to feed also sold to a dearer trend with an improvement in quality.

There were insufficient grown steers for a quote, while well finished grown heifers were quite a bit dearer. There was little change in the market for medium and heavy weight cows with a few plain condition light weights dearer to restockers."
"Consignments fell by more than 50% for the final sale. A very good quality line of light weight vealers were a feature along with quite a few well finished heavy weight cows. There was a very mixed quality and condition penning of yearlings and grown cattle. Restricted export and trade processor competition, however restocker demand was very high.

The light weight vealers and yearlings to restock experienced significant price improvements helped in some cases by a vast improvement in quality and in others by a lack of weight. Medium and heavy yearlings to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend than the previous sale 2 weeks ago.

Grown cattle to process sold to a cheaper trend with the reduced competition, with the heavy steers averaging 9c cheaper and the heavy weight cows down by an average of 13c/kg."
"Consignments fell by almost half, although all categories were represented. There were some well finished heavy grown steers penned, something not seen here for some time. The overall quality and condition of the offering was fair to good with reduced supplies of secondary quality cattle. It was a similar line-up of buyers in attendance along with a few more restocker orders.

Demand varied throughout the sale creating a market of mixed trends. In the young cattle light weight weaner steers to restock sold to a dearer trend with the plainer quality light weights showing strong gains. The medium and heavy weaner steers sold to a cheaper trend, averaging 5c/kg lower. The heifer weaners went the opposite way with light weights cheaper and the medium weights up to 4c/kg dearer. Medium and heavy yearling steers sold to a dearer trend with the heavy weights recording strong gains. That trend also followed into the heifer yearlings.

There have been no heavy grown steers penned recently to make a market comparison. The cow market was firm to slightly dearer with little price variation between restocker cows and the well finished processing cows. Competition was very strong in the heavy bull market, dearer trends resulting."
"Compared to the previous sale held on the 20th October numbers increased with a 2 week supply brought forward. There was a good supply of light and medium weight young cattle penned with small numbers in all other categories. The quality of the offering was fair to good, however most of the well finished lots appeared in the grown cattle. There was restricted processor competition given the low availability, however restocker demand was high.

There were varying market trends in the young cattle to restock. The increased numbers brought about some quality changes, both positively and negatively. The better quality light and medium weight yearling steers sold to a dearer trend up 20c to 30c/kg with buyers looking for cattle representing a shorter turnoff. The plain quality and very light weight yearling steers saw a firm to cheaper market trend with some buyers reluctant to take on long term projects in the face of a market that has eased recently. Those market trends also carried through to the heifer yearlings.

The well finished grown heifers sold to a dearer trend with an improvement in quality. There were some very good heavy weight cows penned and taking an improvement in quality into account the market trend was up to 8c/kg dearer."
"Colder and dryer conditions stripped considerable condition from most of the cattle yarded, and the general description of the yarding was plain. Weaners and cows again made up the majority in the yarding with very few tradeweight yearlings yarded and no bullocks were available.

There were less trade cattle orders in the market as the lack of supply has become a serious problem for shop trade buyers. Weaner steers were all bought by restockers, but the demand weakened to the stage where prices were 12c to 20c/kg cheaper. Heifer weaners lost considerable value at the previous sale and prices were therefore only 5c or 6c/kg cheaper. Trade yearlings and heavy vealers were short supplied but indications were for a steady market.

No bullock quote was possible due to the total lack of numbers. Heavy heifers were 5c/kg cheaper. Lightweight and out of condition cows were considerably cheaper due to an oversupply, while the better conditioned types were firm to 3c/kg cheaper. There was no change in bull price but heavy, plain bred feeder steers were cheaper by up to 12c/kg."
"Cattle numbers were steady but the average condition and breed quality is lower each week. The majority of the cattle were yearlings with only a few pens of weaners, a few bullocks and feeder cattle, while the yarding was dominated by yearling heifers. There were no more than 30 cows yarded, most having been sold prior to calving which has just begun in the district. The yield and therefore the quality of the bulls were down on the previous market.

Values varied widely on young cattle with restocker and feeder steers selling at firm rates. Most, but not all heifers were cheaper by between 6c and 12c/kg, whilst some of the lighter and plainer heifers held value better than the best quality cattle. The biggest demand for the restocker cattle was from local growers who sought to buy lightweight cattle many of which were out of condition compared to the top percentage. 

Indications were for a firm market on bullocks and cows, but the lack of numbers made a full quote difficult. Bulls sold to 10c/kg cheaper even with the lack of yield having been taken into account."
"Cattle numbers were down this week, a trend that is normal for this time of the year.  Weaner and feeder cattle made up a large percentage of the yarding, with only a few bullocks and steers and a small penning of cows.

Quality was fairly plain in the young cattle section with the exception of a few pens of milk veal however, there were some good runs of well-bred weaners and yearling steers offered. Competition was much stronger with restocker weaner steers 10c dearer and more in places, while vealer heifers held firm. Yearling steers were keenly sought after by both restockers and feeders and made gains of 30c for the well-bred steers, while feeder heifers were 10c/kg dearer.

The yarding of export cattle was made up of an odd pen of bullocks, steers, heifers and a few pens of cows. Quality was mixed with only an odd pen of cattle showing good yield. Steers were 3c to 5c dearer, while cows ranged from 7c to 10c/kg dearer.  Restockers competed strongly on the light cows, out bidding processors."
"Cattle numbers were down slightly this week following good falls of rain throughout the tablelands area.  Vealers were in light supply while there was good numbers of restocker and feeder steers and increased numbers of yearling heifers.  There was a fair yarding of export cattle consisting of some good quality steers and cows.

Quality in the over all yarding was mixed although there was some well-bred feeder and restocker cattle.  The market was generally cheaper with the light supply of vealers loosing more ground this week.  Although restockers and feeders were quite active in the market most steers were 10c to 15c/kg cheaper and yearling heifers followed a similar trend.

The yarding of export cattle was made up of some good runs of well-finished steers and some good pens of cows, while heifers were in fair numbers.  Bullocks and steers met weaker competition to sell up to 15c/kg cheaper.  The cow market was down by 4c to 6c/kg with restockers competing on plainer types.  The good penning of bulls sold to a dearer trend as a main buyer reentered the market this week.

Top price of the sale was for lightweight veal at 209.2c/kg."
"Cattle numbers remained static but quality was similar to last sale with limited supplies of fat stock but numbers of cows, heifers and plain light yearlings. There were not enough bullocks to quote and young cattle were mainly yearling heifers. Supplies of restocker yearling heifers and steers were again the greatest percentage of the offering. There were very few bulls yarded but they were high yielding.

The usual buyers were in attendance together with plenty of restocker competition. Values for young cattle did not vary from last sale with the possible exception of just a few pens of better vealers which were slightly dearer. Restocker demand was maintained at the usual high level.

There were no heavy steers or bullocks yarded but the good pens of export heifers maintained last weeks rates. There was considerable variation in cow demand and prices, but overall the average price remained unaltered. The few pens of well bred feeder cattle sold at fully firm rates.

The top sale price of 239.2c/kg was paid by a wholesaler for a pen of young heifer vealers."
"Cattle numbers remained low even though the dry weather situation has become more serious as each week passes. Quality was extremely plain with the majority of the yarding being over condition yearlings.  There were some pens of better conditioned cattle available but they were in the minority.  No bullocks or weaners yarded and there were a few pens of cows and calves which were light conditioned and sold at open auction to $555/head.

Except for yearling steers, very light weights but well bred sold at the previous weeks rates, the balance of the heavier yearlings were considerably cheaper whether bought by wholesales or restockers.

All cows were cheaper by up to 8c/kg and bulls sold at a similar drop in value. There were no steers bought by feedlots."
"Cattle numbers reduced fairly quickly on the run up to the end of June with numbers forecast to lift over the next two weeks and then settle into the lower late winter yardings. The young cattle and cows dominated the yarding with heavy steers and bullocks now getting more difficult to source. Export heifers continue in fair numbers while restocker steers are still coming forward as a fair percentage of the total yarding.

The usual buyers attended the market and the trend across all descriptions was firm at worst and considerably dearer at best. Light heifer vealers and yearling trade heifers all sold at much dearer rates under a very strong demand. All feeder steers and weaners and yearling steers going to restockers held their price well with the absolute best breed quality selling to a dearer trend.

The light numbers of export steers and bullocks were firm or just a little above the rate of last sale. The cow market for the second week showed some rises with prices for all types much dearer and there were some extreme rises showing. However the market has not yet reached the extremes of six months ago. Included in the price rises were the export weight heifers.

The top price in the sale was 219.2c/kg paid for light heifer vealers under 200kg liveweight."
"Cattle numbers levelled off but quality was below standard. Yearlings dominated supply with steers in greater numbers than heifers. Bullocks and heavy steers were in short supply and cow numbers were lower than at any time this season. Trade yearling steers were only offered in small lots or single sales. There were a number of pens of well-finished older heifers yarded, which had been crop fattened.

Restocker demand for yearling steers was strong with local growers being the major strength. Quality in yearling steers was improved and prices increased by up to 10c/kg for the restocker portion. Light trade heifer yearlings were cheaper but heavy weight yearling heifers sold at firm rates.

The few heavy steers and bullocks yarded were firm to marginally cheaper, and supplies were limited. Cows sold at firm rates for the small yarding available. Bulls were plain conditioned but sold at firm rates. Heavy export heifers were fully firm.

The best price recorded was 221.2c/kg paid on two occasions for C2 yearling steers estimated to weigh 280 to 295kg. A local restocker bought both pens."
"Cattle numbers increased compared to a fortnight ago. It was an overall decrease in the quality with more plainer pens with some cattle showing the effects of the Winter season. There were some good cows and well bred younger cattle and parts of the heifer portion of the sale lacked condition. Many pens of yearlings were again sold throughout the market. A cold morning greeted the regular buying group as they were more selective and operated with significant less demand. However, a highlight of the sale was a couple of well bred lighter cattle selling close to firm with four pens of steers selling from 601c to 624c/kg going to restockers. 

Most of the younger cattle and grown cattle sold mainly from 30c to 40c/kg weaker with a few sales of well presented cattle less affected. Cows were from 40c to 50c/kg lower and the bulls sold from 20c to 30c/kg cheaper. Isolated sales in most categories were back much further the with the drop in quality also a contributing factor. 

Vealer steers made from 456c to 624c and heifer vealers sold from 400c to 470c/kg. Yearling steers of better quality suiting the feeders and restockers  made from 472c to 570c with plainer types making from 360c to 470c/kg. The better yearling heifers for feeders and going back to the paddock made 444c to 584c and secondary heifers sold from 330c to 370c/kg.

Grown steers to the processors made from 310c to 370c and the steers to the feeders made from between 328c to 446c/kg. Good quality grown heifers sold from 325c to 450c with restockers and feeders paying from 249c up to 480c/kg for their grown heifers.
Heavy beef cows made from 245c to 304c, leaner medium weight cows sold from 202c to 280c and cows to restockers made from 196c to 346c/kg. Heavy beef bulls made from 245c to 273c/kg.

Market Reporter, Tim Delany."
"Cattle numbers increased after some disappointing rainfall forecasts delivered little during the week. All categories were represented with females making up a large percentage of the offering. The overall quality and condition of the penning was mixed with limited numbers of well finished young cattle. There were some good heavy grown steers and heifers along with a fair supply of well finished cows. Plain condition cattle still made up the bulk offered, with seasonal conditions far from what would be considered normal for this time of the year. All the regular processor, feedlot and restocker orders were in place for a market showing firm to dearer trends for the most part.

There were increased numbers calves penned with most going to restockers at prices similar to the previous sale. Lightweight yearling steers to restock and feed averaged cheaper, although most of those price changes were quality related, with little change in the market trend. There were too few medium and heavyweights to quote. Heifer yearlings sold in the range of the previous sale, with little but quality related price change. The plainer condition and secondary quality lightweights sold to a dearer trend.

Heavy grown steers sold to a dearer trend, up 10c to 12c/kg as export processors looked to fill orders. Heavy feeder steers carrying permanent teeth attracted stronger demand to also sell to a dearer trend. Grown heifers sold to a dearer trend, with quite a few suitable to the feeder orders, and as a result prices and trends showed strong gains, particularly for those with 2 or 4 teeth and in excess of 400kg. Heavy heifers to process also sold to a dearer trend. There was little but quality related change in the cow market with a few improved quality lots penned. Very plain condition light and medium weights were cheaper if there was no restocker competition."
"Cattle numbers continue at the higher levels with the weather drying off and winter approaching. The bulk of the yarding was weaner cattle and cows of all weights. Trade heifers were in fair numbers as were the heavier export heifers but male cattle over one year were very short supplied. Feeder steers were also short in number.

The usual buyers attended the sale and in young cattle there was a variety of market trends. Steer weaners selling to restockers were cheaper with the approach of the New England weaner sales combining with a need for more rain to consolidate the feed situation. The falls were not dramatic. Weaner heifers to slaughter varied widely within the market but the overall affect was a cheapening of  6c to 7c/kg. Trade heifers were fully firm and there were no trade steers yarded that went to slaughter. Restocker steer yearlings were yarded in the lightest numbers for many months.

There was no light to medium bullocks or heavy steers available but there were a few pens of heavy bullocks that sold to a dearer market. The cow market was the highlight of the market with prices very solid indeed. There was a dearer tendency in most slaughter cows with lightweights being pushed along by strong grower demand. The top price for cows was 180.2c/kg for joined cows bought by restockers and this is the highest price yet seen in Armidale for cows at sale by weight.

The top price of the sale was 243c/kg paid for very light steer weaners bought by a restocker."
"Breed quality was quite good but there were a limited number of prime cattle yarded. The majority of the yarding, up to 85%, were bought by restockers with yearling steers and heifers as well as weaner heifers making the bulk of the offering. Feeder steers were in the lowest numbers for months which is an indication that the district has run out of these descriptions of cattle after many months of a sell off. There were no bullocks yarded and limited cow numbers, most bought by restockers on a PTIC basis.

Demand for restocker cattle was outstanding with steer and heifer weaners and yearling steers and heifers all selling at considerably dearer rates to mainly local buyers. There was only a single pen of trade heifers in the whole yarding and they were supplementary fed. There were no trade heifers and only a few lots of yearling feeder steers. Light yearling heifers sold at dearer rates, all to restockers.

There is no heavy steer, bullock or export heifer quote due to a total lack of numbers. Cows sold strongly with only a very few pens going to exporters, the balance of the offering were bought by restockers. There were only two bulls yarded and they sold at firm rates."
"Breed quality was improved on many descriptions but not on all types. Yearling heifers made up a greater proportion of the yarding than usual, while weaners and restocker yearlings were not plentiful. Heavy steers and bullocks were well supplied and trade cattle were in limited supply. Cows made up 20% of the yarding and their yield potential was above last sale. Bull quality was also improved.

The usual regular buying orders were available and the trend in the market was firm or dearer. With the exception of steer weaners to restockers, most young stock varied between fully firm and dearer. Steer weaner prices were unchanged, and most pens of heifer weaners and trade cattle sold between firm and 5c dearer, with the average price rise being 3c/kg. 

Heavy steers and bullocks were in fair numbers and while their yield potential was not outstanding, values improved, particularly on younger types. Export heifers met another strong enquiry to record a firm or dearer market trend. Cows met the same increased demand and values were at worst fully firm, and at best a few cents per kilogram dearer. Bull values were also dearer.

Top price of the sale was 216.4c/kg paid by a restocker for very lightweight steer weaners."
"Breed quality was improved in a yarding of mostly weaners, vealers and cows but the number of prime cattle was limited. Most of the weaner steers were British breeds and were bought by restockers from within the local area. The heifer vealers were well supplied with the majority being two score for fat cover. There were no fat bullocks available while cows of all weights were well supplied as has been the case for the past month as the dry weather continues. Restocker yearling steers were not in numbers and demand for them was steady.

The usual orders for young cattle were again represented while the market trend varied from dearer for the better steer weaners and heifer vealers, to 6c/kg cheaper for plainer types. It was very obvious that there has been a much greater accent placed on quality steer weaners by the restockers and the gap in values between the best and the secondary types is widening. The very few small pens of trade steers sold at cheaper rates while heifer yearling values held well.

The few bullocks yarded varied as far as market trends were concerned, but the best sold at slightly dearer rates while the older and plainer end were cheaper. Cow prices were generally up to 5c/kg cheaper but there were three or four pens of the best cows which sold at fully firm rates."
"Both the yarding size and the quality of most cattle fell away sharply, as the end of the major portion of the selling season approaches.  The majority of the offering, as has been the case for many weeks, were yearlings or weaners, with a fair percentage of feeder steers and heifers, and a greater percentage of resocker yearling steers. There were only 35 cows offered to the slaughter and no young bullocks, even though there were plenty of younger cull bulls.

Firm or dearer was the trend in the younger portion of the yarding.  Heifer weaners steer weaners and feeder yearling heifers were all fully firm in value, while the yearling restocker steers were dearer by 3c to 5c/kg under keen northern competition. There was only an odd pen of trade heifers which showed little change.

No bullock or heavy steer quote is possible but there was a dearer trend of up to 6c/kg paid for all weights in feeder steers.  There were no high yield cows available but the medium types sold at steady rates while restockers bought the light weights at varying rates. The bull price was 10c to 15c/kg cheaper."
"Both fat and breed quality varied widely but generally it was a fair quality yarding. Heifer vealers, trade steers and heavier feeder steers were well represented but cows were in less numbers and were well down in yield expectation. Restocker steer weaners and yearling steers were in slightly greater numbers than last sale, while young bullocks, some fattened of oat crops were well represented.

The usual buyers attended the sale and the trend was for a firm or dearer market. Light feeder steers sold at fully firm rates under steady demand. Light heifer vealers met much stronger demand to record a considerable price increase in keeping with earlier northern markets. Trade yearlings were much more popular with buyers and sold up to 7c/kg dearer across all weights. Restocker cattle continued to sell strongly at fully firm prices.

Demand for quality bullocks was evident and values for younger types were dearer. Plainer steers were firm but heavy feeder steers were dearer. Heavy heifers and all cows were firm on the lower yield potential while the smaller yarding of bulls remained unchanged for price.

The top sale price was 220.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight steer weaners."
"Between 30mm and 50mm of rain across most of the district slowed the cattle numbers down. The bulk of the yarding were young cattle under two years old with vealers and weaners together with a big percentage of restockers and feeder steers making up most of the yarding. Cows were in lower numbers than in recent sales, while heavy steers and bullocks were in short supplied. The breed quality of the cattle was good but there were not a lot of slaughter cattle in the young stock and the majority were bought by feeders or restockers. 

Lot feeders and restockers were mostly responsible for a large increase in values on all young cattle with restockers buying both steers and heifers at prices in some cases as much as 13c higher but averaging an increase of between 5 and 7c/kg. In a lot of sales wholesalers and butchers were outbidden by restocker demand. Very lightweight steer weaners and yearling steers are selling at close to the strongest point of the spring and summer season.

Demand for the heavy steers and the bullocks were again keen with increased prices up to 4 and 5c/kg being the order of the day. The bullock numbers are very light, as most were sold on a reasonably strong market some weeks earlier. The cow market was again dearer with numbers reducing following the last rain. There has again been restocker demand develop for medium and lightweight cows as restockers look for something to control rapid pasture growth."
"Between 16 and 25mls of rain had the effect of halving the yarding numbers. There were some better breed quality pens of steer weaners and vealers but otherwise there was little alteration in overall quality.

Vealers and weaners were in good numbers while feeder and restocker yearlings were in fair numbers as were the cows. Heavy steers and light bullocks were mostly under finished with the prospect of winter forcing some of these types on to the market. The buying strength was back to normal on slaughter cattle with some extra buyers of steer weaners and feeder steers attending.

There was another strong market for most cattle with steer weaners fully firm and heifer vealers and trade heifers dearer by a few c/kg. Feeder steers sold at prices improved by up to 4c/kg under much stronger, sustained enquiry. Heavy steers and a few plain bullocks were marginally dearer but quality was lacking. 

The slaughter cows struggled to maintain a firm market but the lighter restocker cows sold up to 4 c/kg dearer under a solid demand. There was a weaker bull market with prices falling by 3 c/kg with bidding dull."
"As with most selling centres this week numbers almost doubled with a large penning of young cattle. There were a few heavy cattle with cows making up the bulk of the grown cattle offering. Overall the quality of the cattle was mixed with the majority of the young cattle in condition more suited to restock and feed rather than the trade. The regular buyers were in attendance.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with lightweight steer weaners returning to the paddock selling firm to slightly cheaper. The medium and heavy steer weaners attracted increased backgrounding support and sold to a dearer trend, up to 10c/kg. There was also a premium for the few EU accredited lines. Heifer vealers remained firm for some, while the majority sold to a cheaper trend with processors competing only on those lots showing good cover. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend with less competition. Heavy feeders were well sought to remain close to firm, with premiums for the straight Angus lines. Yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend through all classes.

The majority of the grown steers were purchased by feed lotters with those over 400kg selling to a dearer trend. There were strong premiums for steers carrying a maximum of 2 permanent teeth. There were cheaper trends through the cow market with the best of the heavy weights up to 11c/kg cheaper, while good restocker competition restricted the downward trend on the plainer condition lines."
"As we come into the usual sell off period for the Tablelands the numbers continue to increase. There was an overall improvement in the quality of the offering although there were still plenty of plain conditioned cattle penned. All the regular buyers were in attendance. There were some good quality light vealers as well as a better quality offering of heavy cows.

The market trend for the young cattle was firm to cheaper. The best quality restocker vealer and yearling steers were firm. The plainer quality vealer steers and yearling steers were cheaper by 5c to 8c/kg. Trade yearling heifers followed a similar trend, firm for the best and cheaper for the plainer quality grades.

There were insufficient well finished heavy steers for a quote. The best medium and heavy cows were firm. The plainer conditioned cows were generally 8c to 10c/kg cheaper. Restockers were selective in their purchases and were prepared to pay similar rates to last week for the best quality store cows. There was a run of cows scanned in calf that sold at the high end of the restocker cow rates."
"As there was no sale for two weeks due to the Anzac day holiday this report therefore compares with that earlier sale. The yarding was very similar quality to last sale with cows making up 25% of the total. Weaners and vealer cattle were again in the biggest numbers while trade cattle and bullocks were short supplied. Over 50% of the yarding were bought to restock or by feedlots. There were some very good pens of well finished cattle but they were a small percentage of the total.

The market was predictably cheaper with winter approaching and no rain in sight. Steer weaners to restockers averaged a 15c/kg fall in price while the heifer vealers sold at cheaper rates but the falls were not to the same extent as the steers. Trade cattle were all cheaper but the yield was well below last sale. Restocker steer yearlings also lost considerable value. All weights in the feeder steers were very much cheaper than a fortnight ago.

Heavy steers were in fair numbers and together with the few bullocks yarded they sold at cheaper prices averaging close to 7c/kg. All cows lost ground to sell between 5c and 9c/kg cheaper with the biggest drop seen in the medium cows. Bulls were fully firm on the last sale.

The top sale price was 203.6c/kg paid for some very well finished heavy European cross steer vealers."
"As the number of days increase since the last useful rain event so did the numbers. It was a very mixed quality penning of young cattle, which also showed variation in condition. There were a few well finished heavy grown steers along with a good supply of well finished cows and grown heifers. The usual processor orders were in place; however, there was a reduced feedlot and restocker presence.

Market trends were generally cheaper through the young cattle and substantially so for the plain and secondary quality cattle. A reduction in both weight and quality saw weaner steers to restock sell to a cheaper trend of 18c/kg and more in places. Medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed met with limited demand and competition to see a cheaper trend of as much as 20c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers to restock and feed defied the trend to sell on a dearer market. The medium and heavy weight heifers to feed were significantly cheaper, once again quality and demand were factors. The well finished heavy heifers suitable to the trade followed a similar trend.

There were a few well finished heavy grown steers suitable to the processors, a reverse of the previous week, where none went to processors. The market trend for well finished grown heifers was firm to cheaper with the lessor quality lots most affected. The cow market was also cheaper, down by 10c to 14c/kg on the well finished heavy weights. There was little change in the market trend for heavy weight bulls."
"As has been the trend, numbers returned to pre rain levels. All grades were represented in what was a mixed quality offering. The overall condition of the yarding held up well despite the big number. All regular buyers were in attendance.

The young cattle market saw the best quality weaners and vealers remain firm. There were some sales a little cheaper however any change in price was quality related. The yearling cattle followed a similar trend. Once again restockers were active on both steer weaners and yearling steers with processors picking up the majority of the females.

There were very few good quality heavy steers in the offering and they sold at rates cheaper than last week as a result. The cow market maintained itself with little change throughout and once again there were a few quality related variations."
"As has been the trend throughout the North this week numbers fell by 50%. Most grades were represented with yearling cattle in the main. There were a small number of well finished heavyweight steers and cows although the majority of the penning lacked finish. Not all regular orders were in place. Producers and agents prepared to market their livestock were rewarded.

The young cattle market showed a dearer trend through all grades with supply and demand driving values. The majority of the steer yearlings went to restockers with breed quality mostly good. There were limited numbers of well finished heifer yearlings with processors and restockers competing on the plainer conditioned lots.

Grown cattle followed a similar trend to the young cattle with all grades showing a firm to dearer trend. The absence of some processors did little to detract form the market with all in attendance looking to secure supply in an effort to maintain production despite the industrial action from some transport operators."
"Around 25mm of rain in the district was handy but had little effect on the numbers on offer.It was a somewhat mixed yarding with quality cows and light vealers the majority while fair numbers of feeder and heavy steers and light bullocks were yarded. Trade cattle  were in short supply as appears to be the case currently in the north. 

Some expected a market rise following the rain however generally this did not eventuate in young stock . Light heifer vealers were a little cheaper following the strong market last week. Feeder and restocker yearling steers were only just at last sale levels as winter is a little too close for local growers to fatten cattle. Once again there were a number of quite well finished steers that went to feedlots rather than to slaughter.

The heavy steer and bullock numbers were fair and the market for the better end was dearer while the plainer types sold at firm levels. The cow market was a little stronger with buyers anticipating a shortage when the weather takes up. There was little change in the bull market as quality was plain only. So far there has been little sign of significant price rises in export cattle due to the considerable drop in the value of the Australian dollar."
"Armidale saw an increase of 248 cattle. Quality and weight lifting in the young cattle, as well as an improvement in the cow offering, that category seeing a significant increase in trends, particularly in the D4 heavy offering. All the regular processors, feeder operators and restockers were present and competing in a generally dearer market.

Steer weaners sold back to the paddock at substantially dearer trends, topping at 534c/kg.The heifer portion under 200kg also sold to dearer trends. Yearling steers under 330kg saw slightly dearer trends, while medium and heavy feeders were firm. Medium weight heifers to feed and to processor also sold to firm trends.

Heavy steers to the trade sold to a dearer trend, as did the heifer portion, selling to 319c/kg. Medium weight cows saw dearer trends of 17c, with the D4 cows, carrying increased weights sold to significant rises of 23c/kg. The best bulls also saw an increase in weights to see moderate gains."
"Armidale penned 400 mixed cattle back 985. Plainer cattle dominated however pens of well bred yearlings and weaners suited feeder and background operators. Less quality and a lack of numbers reduced buying power to result in cheaper trends for the most part.

Well bred weaner steers sold to 394c/kg, Most steer weaners sold to cheaper trends. The tops of the heifer weaners were 7c/kg back making 218c to 270c/kg. Quality improvement for light background steers saw a rise of 11c/kg. Similar rises for medium steers 320c to 390c/kg. Plainer yearling heifers under 330kgs were considerably cheaper with medium weights to similar trends. 

Grown heifers to restockers sold 144c to 158c/kg. Medium cows 4c/kg dearer. Heavy cows bore the brunt of the correction 159c to 190c/kg.

Stephen Adams MLA"
"Armidale penned 278 head less to offer 1462 mostly good quality cattle with mixed pens of plainer quality through the offering. Not all buyers attended with a marked absence of two major exporters  that having a negative result on the cow market. Better bred pens of yearlings were subject to strong feeder interest on medium and heavy feeders of both genders. That said trends varied firm to cheaper from last sale. Backgrounders were strong with competition from local purchasers again with subdued trends.

Light yearling steers to background considerably cheaper 334c to 338c/kg. Medium feeders firm 318c to 414c/kg. Similar weight backgrounders cheaper 360c to 404c/kg. Steers to feed up over 400kgs to 348c/kg. Light background heifers significantly cheaper 300c to 322c/kg. Medium feeders 305c to 359c/kg backgrounders to 349c/kg. Heavy feeders to 348c/kg. 

Heavy grown steers to process 320c to 330c/kg similar heifers 320c to 346c/kg. Cows sold to cheaper trends throughout medium weights 242c to 295c/kg the heavy weights 270c to 316c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to a firm result 270c to 312c/kg. 

Stephen Adams MLA"
"Armidale penned 1740 mostly good quality cattle an addition of 800 head. Cow numbers and quality increased along with good numbers of heavy feeders on offer. The balance of the young cattle were somewhat mixed and trends for those categories sold to varied results. . Cows on the other hand sold to dearer trends throughout. The regular buyers attended and operated.

Better bred light yearling steers sold to dearer trends for backgrounders with feeders dearer 328c to 414c/kg. Feeder steers under 330kgs were dearer 280c to 418c/kg and similar weights to background selling 350c to 442c/kg. Medium feeders solid 320c to 411c/kg and similar steers to the paddock 400c/kg. Light plain heifers to backgrounders 280c to 340c/kg and heifers under 330kgs 316c to 339c/kg.. Medium feeders 296c to 340c/kg. Heavy processor yearling heifers made to 310c/kg.

Heavy grown heifers to process 297c to 330c/kg. Cows resulted in dearer trends the three and four score categories making 280c to 315c/kg. Heavy bulls 253c to 328c/kg.

Stephen  Adams MLA"
"Armidale penned 1251 mixed quality cattle which was 396 more than two weeks ago.  It was a market where yearling cattle provided the bulk of the offering with pens of weaner steers and heifers suitable for backgrounders. There were several pens of very heavy yearling steers and heifers to go onto a short feed regime. Not all exporters attended but the regular feeder and background operators attended to a considerably dearer market.

Weaner steers to restockers were significantly dearer to top at 416c/kg with similar trends resulting in the heifer sales 180 to 294c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers sold to dearer trends of up to 23c/kg with their heavier brothers marginally dearer. Medium weight heifers sold to a similar vein with a rise of 26c/kg and light feeder heifers selling to 310c/kg.

Heavy grown steers in excess of 750kgs lwt made to 281c/kg and grown heifers to process 220c/kg. Medium weight cows made to 172c/kg with a solid rise of 16c/kg for the heavy drafts 160 to 218c/kg. A reduction in weight and quality for the bull offering saw that category sell to cheaper trends.

Market Operator Stephen Adams"
"Armidale numbers were static at 477 good quality cattle with a large offering of cows.  There was strong demand for the lighter end of the young cattle. Not all cow buyers attended but those present competed strongly for the well presented penning. Restockers were present to make strong purchases through the young cattle particularly in the younger,lighter steer and heifer weaners. All the other regular buyers attended. 

Weaner steers sold to considerably dearer trends as did the heifer portion.These all sold to restocker interests.A significant rise in trends also shown through the light yearling steers also going to restockers. The feeder portion of these steers making to 646/kg. Heavy feeder steer also dearer. Heifers sold in the same vein with a substantial rise in the light weights again to restockers. Medium weight feeder heifers were up to 35/kg better.The opposite trend was evident through the heavy processing heifers,these back 10/kg.

Grown steers in light numbers saw cheaper trends. Grown heifers to feed on were cheaper with the processor heifers back 24/kg. Medium weight cows were slightly cheaper. Heavy 3and 4 score cows saw a rise of 15c/kg. Heavy bulls to 340/kg.

Market Reporter Stephen Adams"
"Armidale numbers were static at 1385 good quality cattle.Trends through most categories were firm to dearer with heavy cows showing good returns. All regular buyers attended with the inclusion of an extra cow and feeder operator.

Weaner steers to background in strong demand selling to 406.2c/kg and the heifer portion also to dearer trends 252.2c to 270.2c/kg. Light yearling steers to background experienced a rise of 15c/kg with medium weight steers considerably dearer selling to 385.2c/kg. Light background heifers were marginally cheaper with a lapse in quality through the secondary classes. Medium heifers to feed were 10c/kg better and similar weights to background firm. Heavy feeder heifers significantly dearer 232.2c to 314c/kg.

Grown steers to process 244.2c to 285c/kg the heifers made 232c/kg. Medium cows to process back slightly. Heavy cows were 20c/kg dearer 212c to 236.2c/kg. Restocker cows onto grass 170.2c to 185.2c/kg. Heavy bulls were strong selling to 229.2c/kg.

Stephen  Adams MLA"
"Armidale numbers were similar week-on-week, with cows and weaners in the majority. Weaner numbers increased with the cancellation of a sale set down for later in the week. With the exception of a limited offering of well-bred weaners, yearlings and the penning of some of high yielding cows, the quality of the yarding was plain. All the regular operators were present and competing in an improved market.  

Steer weaners to restock saw rising trends of 40c to 50c/kg, while heifers also sold to dearer trends. Trade vealers sold 25c/kg better. Light steer yearlings saw cheaper trends of 6c, while the medium and heavy weight steers to feed sold to a dearer trend of 16c/kg. The medium weight heifers to feed saw a substantial rise of 60c/kg, with a good quality offering coming forward. There were some plainer quality light weaners struggling to make the 200c mark and these saw falls of 20c/kg.

Grown heifers to the trade saw dearer trends of 17c/kg. Plain quality, light cows to restock saw cheaper trends of 40c, while the D2 cows experienced dearer trends of 30c/kg. The D3 cows were also dearer to the value of 34c/kg. High yielding D4 cows saw rises of 30c/kg. Heavy bulls to slaughter sold 29c/kg dearer."
"Another very wet sale with the yarding at 980 fair quality cattle. Yearling trade cattle are being yarded in lighter numbers every week, but heavy steers,  bullocks,and medium and heavy 3 and 4 score cows are in good numbers. A very much stronger demand was evident for all classes of slaughter cattle, with the rises in value on heavy cattle almost at the spectacular level.Young cattle of all graded were 3 to 8 cents dearer, heavy steers 3 to 5 cents dearer and bullocks, 4 score were to 8 cents better. Cows, across all weights were 7 and up to 13 cents dearer for heavy weights,and bulls rose 6 to 7 cents.
Restockers were again very, very strong on all weights of yearling steers.  Buying most of  the steers yarded."
"Another very small yarding as growers struggle to retain breeding cattle having lightened off all sale cattle at an earlier time.  Quality was a little better with a few pens of heavy and medium cows, some heavier heifers and the balance of the yarding were yearlings mainly suitable for restocking.

The market was firm or cheaper with more cheaper prices than firm prices. Yearling restocker steers were cheaper by up to 6c and 7c/kg.  While yearling heifers which were suitable for restockers, lost another 10c/kg partly through a lack of quality.

Older plainer heifers were cheaper while cows held value reasonably well.  A few lots of plain bred older steers were again cheaper with limited restocker interest being the main reason for the price fall.  Bulls were cheaper by 6c/kg."
"Another smaller offering, down by 285 head. The quality was fair to good although condition favored restockers and they were well catered for. Young cattle made up 75% of the yarding and there were 130 cows in the grown cattle section. Grown steers and heifers were in limited numbers. Most of the regular orders were in place and there was a strong gallery of restockers.

The restocker steer market was very strong with medium weight vealers selling to a dearer trend, up by 10c to 20c with the feature being a big line of angus steers making 217c/kg. Heifer vealers to processors also sold to a dearer trend, up 15c to 19c, while a small number of 3 score trade vealers sold 3c cheaper. Yearling steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend with light and medium weights up 11c to 14c and more in places. There were very few heavyweight yearling steers yarded. Light trade heifer yearlings sold firm to 3c dearer with those to restockers and feeders firm to slightly cheaper. Medium and heavy 3 score heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend, down 2c to 4c/kg.

There were insufficient heavy steers to quote while grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c. The cow market saw some variation with the best of the medium and heavyweight cows sell 2c to 4c dearer. Light cows to restockers sold to a dearer trend while medium weight 2 score cows experienced little change. There was a line of PTIC Angus cows offered and they sold from 117c to 136c/kg. Heavy bulls were up to 3c dearer."
"Another small yarding was the result of further rain in the area. Quality also suffered with cows and restocker yearling steers being in the greatest numbers while yearling heifers were also in fair numbers.

The rain brought on the result that was expected and most descriptions were considerably dearer. Restocker yearling steers sold up to 30c dearer to an average of 25c/kg better under intense competition. Yearling heifers were 10c/kg dearer with restockers responsible for that rise, while all other young cattle showed a similar increase in price.

There were not enough bullocks or heavy steers to quote but all cows averaged in excess of 10c/kg dearer, as did the export heifers. Restockers were extremely active on plainer cows to fatten. The bull price remained unaltered.

The top sale price was 163.6c/kg paid for a single light bullock."
"Another small yarding was presented, with the overall quality well back on last sale. The quality of cows, bulls and restock yearling steers on offer was generally fair, with all other cattle relatively plain.

No quote is possible on trade yearlings, however the restock yearling steers (score 2)  sold to a very much local demand, at increased values.

Cows were not quite the quality of last sale but sold at firm rates.Heavy steers were firm,  with largeincreases in prices recieved for heavy export heifers and heavy bulls."
"Another small yarding was offered with vealers and light yearlings making up a good percentage with heifers in the majority. There was only an odd grown steer and heifer through the sale with cow numbers nearly halved. Quality was fairly plain in the market that saw a large percentage of cattle go to restockers. 

Processor competition was limited however, good restocker activity on the better bred cattle helped hold the market up. This was particularly evident on the restocker yearling heifers that were up to 7c/kg dearer. Vealer steers held firm, while yearling steers lost ground with lack of quality having some bearing on the lower prices.

The cow yarding consisted mainly of medium weight 2 and 3 scores and there were insufficient grown steers and heifers to quote. Most cows were 2c/kg cheaper with the odd sale losing more."
"Another small yarding contained some handy slaughter cattle but the majority were in plain and unfinished condition. Cows were in fair numbers with most coming off oat crops while the heavy steers were also crop fed. Light slaughter cattle were only in small numbers and lots while store cattle were plain and under supplied.

There was a reduced number of buyers in attendance due to the small offering. The young cattle either to kill or to restock were marginally cheaper due to the lack of quality. Grown steers  4 score were fair quality and the demand for them was sustained. The dearer market reflected that demand. There were no export bullocks under full mouth in the yard. Store buyers were operating on some of the 3 score steers over 400 kgs.

The cow market was again strong and while there were not many buyers operating they bid keenly on all cows to create a dearer market. Most of the better quality cows were  estimated to yield well probably 1 to 2 percent higher than last sale.

There was a very considerable drop in bull prices with very few buyers operating thereby severely restricting competition. The drop in prices varied between 7c and 15 c/kg .

Store buyers continue to seek quality cattle with the definite signs of an early spring around."
"Another small offering which is not unusual at this time of year. The majority of the offering were young cattle with light weight heifer yearlings making up 50% of the total yarding. The low numbers made for restricted processor competition however support from restockers was strong.

Yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend, up 2c/kg. The light weight heifer yearlings also sold to a dearer trend, both to process and to restockers, up 7c/kg. The medium weight C3 heifer yearlings to the trade saw quality improve, with the market dearer, up 10c/kg.

There were insufficient heavy steers or grown heifers to quote, while the small offering of cows sold to a dearer trend, both to process and to restockers."
"Another small offering of mixed quality cattle was penned. Almost half of the yarding were cows, which was outside the norm for a traditionally spring calving area. The regular processors were in attendance and restocker activity was once again strong.

All of the yearling cattle were purchased by restockers or feedlots with the market showing a dearer trend. Lightweight yearling steers were up to 7c/kg dearer. The better quality lightweight heifer yearlings experienced a greater rise. There were very few medium and heavy yearling steers available and there were no well finished yearling heifers.

No heavy grown steers were penned, while grown heifers with 2 or more teeth were in reasonable numbers. The market for grown heifers was dearer by up to 8c/kg. Demand for cows was high from both restockers and processors. The market showing a dearer trend by 2c/kg on both cows to process and restock."
"Another small offering as spring starts and producers with hold stock in an effort to value add as the season starts to improve. Most grades were represented in what was a plain quality and condition yarding. Once again yearlings made up at least 50% of the offering with plain conditioned grown heifers well represented. Well finished cattle were in limited supply. Not all regular buyers were represented.

The quality of the yarding played a major role in a market that saw most grades of young cattle sell to a cheaper trend. Restockers purchased most yearling steers with the trend 6c to 20c/kg cheaper through all weight ranges. The bright spot in the market were the better quality yearling heifers to restockers, these sold to a dearer trend, up 1c/kg. Trade heifer yearlings sold to a cheaper trend, down 1c to 3c, while plain quality and condition heifer yearlings to restockers were cheaper by as much as 20c/kg.

There were limited numbers of well finished grown steers suitable for slaughter, they sold cheaper by 5c/kg. Grown heifers both to slaughter and restockers sold to a cheaper trend, the quality a factor. Cow numbers were down with few well finished cows penned. The market was down 1c to 11c/kg."
"Another small offering and the quality was only fair, with condition on the plain side. There were quite a few lightweight yearlings, a small number of cows with heavyweight grown steers to few to quote. Not all regular processor orders were in place while restocker demand was once again strong.

Lightweight yearling steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend, up 4c/kg. The medium weight steers sold cheaper, with quality accounting for most of the price change. The lightweight heifer yearlings to restockers sold to a dearer trend up 10c/kg, while medium weights to restockers sold cheaper. 

The small number of finished cattle suitable to the trade sold to a slightly dearer trend. There were too few heavyweight steers to quote. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend, with an isolated pen of well finished, high yielding heifers a little dearer. The cow market suffered under restricted processor competition to show a cheaper trend, down 5c to 12c/kg. Restocker and PTIC cows sold firm."
"Another large offering although actual numbers were below those booked in with some producers opting to hold off. Cows and vealers made up the biggest percentage of the yarding. There were limited numbers of good quality yearlings and very few heavy cattle. The regular processors attended along with extra feedlot competition and there was good restocker demand for store cows and steer vealers. 

The good quality medium weight steer vealers to restock sold to a dearer trend, up to 5c/kg. The best of the lightweights remained firm while the plainer quality lightweights sold to a cheaper trend.  Heifer vealers sold to a cheaper trend to both restocker and processor orders, those to restockers were least affected with some sales remaining firm. The quality of the light and medium weight yearling steers contributed to price variations, otherwise there was little change. Heavy feeders attracted increased competition, however remained firm. There was also little but quality related change in heifer yearlings.

There were too few heavy steers or heifers for a quote. The large numbers of plain condition cows included numbers of younger cattle as producers start to offload breeders. Restockers were active with the plain condition lightweight cows selling to a dearer trend. Medium weights to restock and process sold to a slightly cheaper trend. The medium and heavy 3 and 4 score cows were up to 8Â¢/kg cheaper."
"An influx of early weaner cattle was the reason for the increase in numbers yarded. Breed quality was good and better than the previous week, and there were also a number of pens of quality prime cattle. Weaners, feeder steers and cows made up the bulk of the offering while the bullocks were in fair numbers but were mainly older types. The bulls were medium to heavily muscled and export weight heifers were only in smaller lots.

The market trend in young cattle varied between fully firm and cheaper. Restocker steer weaners sold at firm rates, but there were isolated signs of a cheapening in some sales. Yearling heifers and heifer vealers were less in demand and sold between 6c and 8c/kg cheaper with one major order for feeder heifers not available. The few domestic weight feeder steers sold at firm prices.

The bulk of the bullocks available were older types and they met a weakened demand to record a 5c/kg price fall. Export heifers and the export feeder steers were steady in price as were all descriptions in the cow yarding. The bull price was firm also."
"An increased yarding showing much improved quality, particularily in yearling cattle and cows. The total of 645 is up by 280 head. The enquiry for most types wasn't quite up to the last sale, with small price reductions in all but the yearling steers. The biggest drop in price occurred on very big, heavy bulls which met a very weak demand to be 12 cents cheaper with two  of the regular bull Buyers dropping out. Restockers were once again very strong on light young cattle, paying well up to the slaughter value on some types."
"An increased yarding of 1990 cattle, up by 850 and fairly normal at this time of year after a few light frosts. The numbers were made up mostly of weaner calves (33% of the total), plain yearling steers and around 400 cows. A cheaper market prevailed for all but the very best restock yearling steer and vealer steers. Heifer vealers were up to 10 cents down with demand failing to handle the sudden number increase. Most yearling steers were 3 to 5 cents cheaper, medium bullocks and heavy steers were 4 to 7 cents cheaper on a big drop in quality. Cows sold 3 to 7 cents cheaper, the light weights most affected. Feeder steers were cheaper by 4 cents and very light cows and bulls, fell by up to 15 cents in places. Restock demand is still strong for quality, but is falling back on lesser quality."
"An increase of over 800 cattle in the yarding was the result of the good price rises in the last fortnight, however under the pressure of increased numbers in the North, in particular,  the market couldn't be sustained. Values for most slaughter cattle were up to 5 cents cheaper, with cows 5 to 8 cents down and bullocks and heavy steers up to 8 cents cheaper in some sales, with the quality, overall, below last sale..
    The restock steer market, versley, was every bit as strong as last sale, and in fact some pens of light steers showed a 1 to 2 cent rise, well against the trend of the rest of the sale."
"An increase of almost 1,000 head took the number to its highest level for several years. Feeder cattle were well supplied and there was a large offering of cows. The large number did little to attract more buyers with competition for both feeder and export cattle reduced. Overall the quality of the offering was fair to good. There were increased supplies of the less sought after breeds evident in the feeder cattle.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with weaner steers to restock selling on a generally firm market with buyers keen to purchase any weight range. The heifer weaners to restock sold to a cheaper trend, up to 5c with the vealers down by 9c/kg. Demand was solid for medium and heavy yearling feeder steers with the market showing little but breed and quality related price change. There were cheaper trends through the yearling heifers with breed a contributing factor along with less competition. Trends were 13c to 17c/kg cheaper. Plain quality mixed pens of young cattle sold to cheaper trends with some significant discounts.

Demand and less competition from processors equated to cheaper trends through the grown cattle to process. Heavy grown steers were up to 9c/kg cheaper with a greater range in quality. The heavy weight feeders remained firm with an odd breed related dearer sale. The most dramatic decline in the market was reserved for cows, where demand and competition was weaker. There was a general market trend of 30c on the well finished cows and as much as 23c/kg easier on the plainer condition lots."
"An increase of 230 head in a total yarding of 810. Some very good yearlings were offered this week, together with a number of pens of excellent shaped, high yielding cows, some off oat crops.

There were no changes in values across all descriptions, that weren't caused by a quality rise, and a full buying field was in attendance.The export cattle continue to sell at better prices, and restocker steers, while not at strong prices, are at least selling at cosistent values."
"An increase in numbers to 1440, with up to 60% of the offering being weaner calves, a normal yarding for May. Except for the best weaner calves and some good pens of medium/heavy cows, quality was fairly plain, with finished cattle in light suppy. There was a bit of variety in prices, with weaner steers averaging a little cheaper but fully firm on the tops. The better finished trade heifers and the medium/heavy 3 and 4 score cows were dearer, and yearling steers stayed at last day rates. Restockers, as at other Northern sales, are very much more selective in quality terms in their purchase of steer weaners and yearling steers."
"An increase in numbers of 75 head to give a total of 660 cattle, with the quality plain, generally the majority yarded being cows and heifers and very few trade yearlings. Please note that this report compares with the last sale of 12/12/96. The market  was solid in young stock with a dearer trend in restock yearlings and heavy steers but with three major Export cow Buyers not operating, for one reason or another, quite a severe drop in value was experienced for all cows and bulls.
       
The strong competition from Restockers was noted on all types of young cattle, including the very young calves up to 4 months of age."
"An increase in numbers of 220 and the quality of the yarding similar to last week except fot the heavy steers and cows, which dropped a liitle quality. Grown steer and yearling steers stayed at firm rates, but the yearling heifers lost value under quieter enquiry, the cows showing a similar trend. There was just a little more life in the restock yrlg steer market. An increase in the numbers offerred is not expected until November, as shearing is currently in full swing."
"An improvement in the average quality of the yarding was well received with buyers able to source suitable cattle more easily. Cow numbers and quality were well improved while weaner cattle reached their usual high level in both quality and supply. Heavier feeder steers were also in greater numbers, while heavy steers and bullocks were marginally better yielding. Restocker yearling steers were in limited numbers.

All the usual regular buyers attended together with a strong contingent of local restockers. The trend in the market, with bulls the exception, was firm or dearer. Restocker young cattle and heifer vealers were fully firm on recent rates, and an improved demand for trade cattle saw a small price rise result.

The young bullocks yarded presented more attractively and both heavy steers and the young bullocks increased in value by an average of 2c/kg. Heavy heifers were fully firm while heavy cows were firm to 3c/kg dearer, with lighter cows were 4c to 7c/kg dearer following last weeks cheaper rates. Bull prices were slightly easier but quality was only fair. There was a stronger demand for heavier feeder steers and a 3c/kg price rise was recorded on most lots.

Top sale price was 209.2c/kg paid by a restocker for lightweight steer weaners."
"An improvement in seasonal conditions with more rain forecast saw numbers remain low. The lowest levels on record for this time of the year. The quality and condition of the offering was fair to good with some well finished cows and grown heifers. The quality of the young cattle was only fair. There was a reduced gallery of processors, however restocker presence was high.

Demand far outweighed supply in the young cattle. Green feed in paddocks the driver for a very strong restocker market. Yearling steers met strong competition to record a trend in excess of 100c/kg dearer in a fortnight. There were some extremes in price ranges with breed the main factor. Heifer yearlings also met with strong restocker competition. Market trends showing an improvement of 50c to 70c/kg.

Processors competed strongly for well finished grown heifers and cows. Restockers purchasing the majority of the plainer condition cattle. Light and medium weight cows to restockers averaged 52c to 67c/kg dearer. Well finished medium and heavyweight cows were as much as 40c/kg dearer."
"An improved quality yarding this week with more of the better cows to pick from, but once again a shortage of trade cattle. Because of the improvement in quality, the market for most descriptions  was fully firm to slightly dearer, with cows in particular making a strong showing.There was activity in the export feeder steer market, at values similar to earlier sales in the North."
"An abundance of green feed saw low numbers presented at the first sale of the new year. All categories were represented with grown heifers more than anything else. The quality was very mixed from both a breed and breeding perspective. Noticeable were the number of Bos Indicus cattle penned. There was limited processor activity, both export and domestic. Restocker and feedlot activity was very high.

Restocker and feedlot demand was high through all classifications of young cattle. Supply issues driving feedlot demand, while the outstanding seasonal conditions, combined the limited supply were major factors in the improvement in restocker cattle. All categories of vealers and yearlings experiencing significant price improvement than the pre-Christmas levels. This trend regardless of breed and quality. There was a small number of heavy weight steers over 500kg penned, most going to feedlotters at prices well in excess of earlier levels. The majority of the grown heifers showed a high level of Bos Indicus content. They attracted strong feedlot competition to show strong gains. The well finished heifers to processors sold strongly. 

There was both restocker and processor competition in the cow market with the market trend dearer than before the break. The increases not as great as those of the younger cattle. Heavy weight bulls were slightly dearer."
"Although most of the yarding was drought affected, there were a surprising numbers of good fat cattle as well as good numbers of very well bred cattle. The cows and the light vealers probably made up 70 percent of the offering. Most types of cattle were represented with the balance of the yarding vealers. There was a much more pronounced demand for all classes of cattle with rain, and the threat of rain in the north, having a very definite affect on some prices.

The usual buyers attended the sale and all were extremely active. Light vealers sold at very much dearer prices with rain in the north east of the State, almost certain to reduce supply in the north. By far the greatest numbers of light vealers were bought to kill as against restocking. All yearling cattle also increased in price under a keen demand.

There were some pens of very good light bullocks yarded and they sold at much dearer rates while the major feature in the sale was again the substantial escalation in price seen on all types of cows. Bulls sold strongly although their quality was only fair. Feeder steers were in surprisingly low numbers indicating probably that most have been sold earlier.

The top sale price was 167.2c/kg paid for well finished bullocks weighing 627kg."
"All categories were represented with numbers remaining steady. Cattle suitable to restock and feed were well represented in all categories. Overall the quality of the penning was good, with condition mostly forward. The full field of regular processors were in attendance however not all regular feedlot orders participated. Demand and activity from restockers remained high.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with light weight vealer steers selling to a slightly cheaper trend, while medium and heavy weights were dearer, with an improvement in quality also. Heifer vealers to restock sold to a dearer trend of as much as 12c/kg with quality also showing improvement. Light and medium weight yearling steers to feed sold to a cheaper trend with the reduced competition while those selling to restockers were firm in places. Strong demand for heavy feeders saw those sell to a dearer trend of 4c to 5c/kg on average. Yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a cheaper trend with the reduced feedlot competition particularly noticeable on medium weights. Strong demand for heavy weights saw the cheaper trend marginal.

Grown steers suitable to feed saw prices improve significantly, with an improvement in quality a major contributing factor. Grown steers to process were in limited numbers with too few for a market comparison. Grown heifer to both feed and process sold to a cheaper trend. The cow market saw trends close to firm on the better condition cows and slightly cheaper with quality variations on the plainer condition cows. Heavy bulls were firm to cheaper however there was not a lot of change."
"All categories were represented in a slightly increased penning. Overall the quality showed improvement and there was a vast improvement in both condition and weight. Medium and heavy weight yearlings were well represented along with heavy grown steers and well finished cows. The usual processors were in attendance with all operating, therefore increasing competition. Restockers and feedlotters were again active with increased restocker competition in places.

Demand was high for all classes of young cattle. Market trends were generally dearer and in line with recent sales at Northern markets. Light weight yearling steers averaged cheaper than the previous sale, however this was related to breed variation and increased weight. Medium weight yearling steers experienced a dearer trend of as much as 25c/kg with some of that increase attributable to quality. Heavy yearling steers to restockers and feedlotters saw a dearer trend of 2c to 13c/kg. There were strong gains for all weight classes of yearling heifers with all but a few purchased for further finishing.

Heavy grown steers to feed sold firm to dearer, there was no comparison available for those to process. The well finished grown heifers remained close to firm. There was improvement in the cow market, up to 4c/kg on those to process and as much as 12c/kg on those to restockers. The heavy bull market was up to 3c/kg cheaper in places."
"Agents yarded 511 head at Mortlake comprising ,312export and194trade as well as 5 bulls . Most of the regular buyers were present and some not all fully active , feeder competition was very active for grown cattle as well as trade cattle.The quality on offer over was again very good to be similar to last weeks offering. The sale was strong resulting in the grown cattle and trade cattle improving another 5 to 10 c/kg cents in places. Manufacturing steers were firm and the cows remained firm to slightly softer over most categories .A very small number of vealers on offer made to  600 c/kg. Yearling Steers and Heifers to the trade made between480c/kg and 554c/kg Grown Steers and Heifers making between 440 and 525 c/kg Manufacturing Steers to 458c/kg. Best Beef cows the general run making between 360 c/kg and 436c/kg.  Dairy Cows 288 to 370c/kg Cows back to the paddock   358 to 386 c/kg Beef bred bulls to 378c/kg

"After some useful rainfall early in the week numbers were down. Again the offering consisted of quite a few plain condition lightweight cattle showing little weight for age. Conversely there were some very well finished heavy heifers and cows, along with a few pens of good quality medium weight yearling steers. The same processors were in attendance from the previous sale, however there was a little less restocker activity across some grades. Market trends varied throughout with competition a factor.

Increased activity from restockers looking for lower priced cattle saw lightweight yearling steers sell to a dearer trend, up 12c/kg and more in places. The largest price gains were seen in the very plain lightweight steers. There was a bit less competition for medium weight yearling steers, which saw that category, sell to a cheaper trend, down 6c/kg. Lightweight yearling heifers were generally cheaper, down 10c to15c/kg. There were odd exceptions with most of that change breed related. There were too few well finished heifers suitable to the trade for a quote.

Demand for heavy export cattle continued with heavy grown steers selling to a dearer trend, up to 11c/kg. Some heavy steers also attracted feedlot competition, however processors purchased all the well-finished lots. The quality of the heavy grown heifers was a feature and contributed to the dearer market trend with prices up to 5c/kg higher. The cow market saw dearer trends for the most part, with the quality at the top end improving. Prices were up to 8c/kg dearer. There was some quality related positive and negative price change in the medium weights. Heavy bulls sold to a cheaper trend with less demand."
"After good rain the yarding numbers did not alter much as this is the usual selling period on the tablelands.The breed quality of the yarding was good but with the exception of cows and heifers there were not a lot of killable cattle available. The bulk of the yarding were weaners and yearlings and a very high percentage of them went back to restockers either to fatten or to grow on. Bullocks were in just enough numbers to quote and heavy heifers to export were in fair numbers.

The rain has tightened up the numbers across the northern areas causing some reasonable price rises. Although the heifer weaners and vealers sold at fully firm rates the steer portion sold very strongly at increased rates to restockers who do not appear able to find enough to satisfy demand .If the season stays at this level the current prices auger well for the coming weaner sales. Trade cattle were also dearer due to a lack of supply and restocker yearling steers were also dearer.

The bullock market in the north since the rain has shown a rise and this sale displayed the same trend although quality was not outstanding. The cow market continues to rise with up to 5 and 6 c/kg rises since the rain fell. Feeder steers in the yard were not ideal for feedlotters and in some cases growers paid just above the feedlot rates to restock."
"After a week of very drying weather, the numbers increased well above any expectation. There were a number of well bred yearling and feeder steers available together with an equally large number of cows of all weights and young weaner calves up to 4 months of age. There were only a few pens of bullocks or heavy steers yarded but yearling heifers and restocker yearling steers were well supplied. The bulk of the cows offered were between light and medium boner types.

Considering the pressure on prices caused by the bigger yarding, the market held up well. Feeder steers in all weights sold at firm rates but restocker steers and yearling heifers of lighter weights, sold at cheaper prices due to a sudden reduction in restocker competition. Light calves were in strong demand from wholesalers and they sold at fully firm prices. Restockers bought some of the calves but the bulk went to kill.

The few pens of bullocks were not high yielding but they sold at firm prices. The light boner cows were cheaper due to a sudden increase in numbers available across the country. The better cows sold at cheaper prices but were not as seriously affected as the boners. The bull price showed very little change.

The top price was 165.6c/kg paid both for light heifer calves and for steer weaners bought to restock."
"After 60 to 70mm of rain in the week the yarding was reduced to 600 very plain cattle,  with 75% female cattle in rhe yard. For the first time in memory,  there were no heavy steers or bullocks available, with good numbers of trade heifers and cows yarded, and just a few yearling steers.

Values for trade yealings stayed firm under the usual strong demand, but the restock steer yearlings were predictably dearer.

There is no quote, due to the lack of numbers, on heavy steers or bullocks, but cows sold in an irregular pattern, with most fully firm on average, but some sales showed falls between 1c and 3c/kg.  Bulls remained at last sale rates."
"After 40 ml of rain last weekend, numbers were back by an extraordinary 1,100 head. The bulk of the yarding was very lightweight yearlings in very plain condition. Quality overall was very plain indeed with the only numbers of fat cattle coming in two or three pens of steers yearlings and otherwise only cows and bulls. There were no heavy steers available and therefore there is no quote available. Cows were in fair numbers but over half were lightweight and in plain condition.

The sale of very lightweight splitter and yearling heifers was extraordinarily strong with demand at the highest level this year. There were numbers of pens that sold at over 30c/kg and more dearer with the average price rise at just over 20c/kg. Resocker steer yearlings were all the lighter weights and the rain spurred on growers so that the prices rose as much as 7c/kg. There were only a few pens of trade heifers available and they sold at fully firm rates.

With no bullocks to quote the cow market was very solid but there were no high yield cows yarded. The bull market was also unchanged. The huge reduction in numbers after such a small amount of rain probably gives an indication of the lack of available cattle if a good fall of rain occurred."
"A wide variation in quality in most descriptions, with yearlings steers in particular, showing an improvement in numbers and quality. All types of cattle met a stronger enquiry, and good price rises resulted. The only price falls recorded were in yearling heifers, which did'nt have the top in them compared to last week. Restock competition accounted for the significant increase in the price of  yearling steers and the overfat 5 score cows met a much stronger demand. Overall,the competition can best be described as very solid."
"A very small yarding of mixed quality cattle this week. There were some good cattle scattered throughout the yarding with females making up the bulk of the sale.

It was very difficult to formulate a market quote for trade cattle given the low numbers on offer, although the quality of the yearling heifers was not as good as last week, hence the reduction in averages. Restocker steers sold up to last weeks rates with very few good quality cattle available.

The few heavy steers and bullocks on offer showed good quality and there were some very good cows offered.

The market for the export cattle was stronger. Most of the rise can be attributed to the low numbers and the quality of the cattle on offer."
"A very small penning that comprised mostly of light weight young cattle of only fair quality. There were limited processor cattle of any quality available. This saw restricted processor attendance. There was good local restocker support.

Market trends saw light weight yearling steers to restockers sell close to firm with some quality related price change. The plainest quality steers were cheaper. The heifer portion sold firm to dearer with average quality improving and accounting for the large price change.

There was little to quote on in the grown steers and heifers with the quality very plain. Light weight cows to restockers sold strongly in comparison to the medium weights. The medium weight cows sold to 5c/kg cheaper.

Armidale livestock selling agents wish to advise that due to the continuing low numbers brought about by unprecedented seasonal conditions in the New England area, the Thursday weekly cattle sale will move to fortnightly until the end of the calendar year with the next sale to be held on 03/11/2016."
"A very small penning consisting of mostly young cattle was yarded to wind up sales for the year. There were very few grown cattle available. The quality of the young cattle was generally good however condition was only fair. There was restricted processor and feedlot competition while restockers were active.

Market trends for young cattle were generally dearer with vealer steers improving by 2c to 6c/kg, with heifers remained firm. Lightweight yearling steers to restockers were 8c to 12c/kg dearer. The reduced competition saw medium weight feeder steers sell to a cheaper trend, down 3c/kg. Light and medium weight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend with quality and straight lines contributing to strong average price improvements. Heavy heifer yearlings struggled to gain any support in the market and were much cheaper.

There were too few grown steers and heifers penned to gauge an accurate market quote. Restocker cows in very small numbers sold to a dearer trend, while those to process were 4c to 5c/kg cheaper."
"A very small offering to wind sales up for the year. Cows made up half of the offering with a few of everything else. Included in the penning of cows was a consignment of PTIC cows. Not all regular processors were in attendance although restockers supported well.

The small number of yearling steers sold to restockers at dearer rates. The balance of the yarding sold at cheaper rates. Some of the yearling heifers were passed in as the vendor opted to take them home rather than accept the price on offer. The better condition cows to processors sold to a cheaper trend, down 6c to 9c/kg. There was good competition on the plain condition cows from restockers with rates showing dearer."
"A very small offering of cattle, most of which lacked finish were yarded. There were a few well finished yearling heifers and cows but generally most lacked bloom and freshness. Most regular processing orders were in place and there were the usual lineup of local restockers.

Despite the low numbers the young cattle market held up quite well. Vealer steers to restockers sold firm to 1c/kg dearer. There were insufficient heifer vealers to quote. Lightweight yearling steers sold to a cheaper trend, down 3c/kg with quality a contributing factor. The medium weight yearling steers to restock attracted good competition to sell to a dearer trend, up 3c/kg. Yearling heifers to restock sold at firm rates while a better quality offering of C3 trade heifers sold dearer, up 13c/kg.

There was a very small offering of heavy grown steers that sold to a cheaper trend. The quality of the grown heifers showed an improvement and they sold firm. The small offering of well finished cows sold to a dearer trend while plain condition cows were cheaper."
"A very small offering after another 50mm of rain fell over the district on Tuesday. The quality of the penning was mixed, but on the plain side with a few well finished cows the exception. Not all regular buyers were in operation, to be expected given the low numbers.

There was little to be taken from a marketing point of view as there were insufficient numbers in any grade to frame a reliable trend. Restockers were keen to purchase anything to eat grass regardless of quality. Quality was the major contributor to price variations, rather than a trend.

The few well finished cows sold at similar rates to the previous sale. Restockers were keen on plain condition cows with large frame cows making more cents per kilogram than seen at recent local sales."
"A very small number was offered, not unusual for this time of the year. Most grades were represented. Cows made up the biggest percentage of the yarding. There was a limited buying field in attendance, while the quality was only fair.

The market showed a cheaper trend throughout most grades as buyers found it difficult to put together a decent run of cattle. There were odd sales that held up to last weeks rates. Most yearling steers to restockers sold 6c to 8c/kg cheaper. Yearling heifers also sold to a cheaper trend, down 7c to 8c/kg. Quality played its part in average price variations. Something that has not been seen here for some time was a line of light vealers, a market quote not possible.

Grown heifers saw the best quality remain firm, while the plainer grades sold to a cheaper trend. Once again quality played its part in price fluctuations. The cow market also eased. Lightweight cows were down 2c, medium weights down 5c to 12c with heavy cows were cheaper by as much as 13c/kg."
"A very similar yarding to last week in terms of the quality with weaners and yearlings in good numbers and of good breed quality. Cows were in very short supply while there were a number of pens of well fattened light to heavy bullocks available. Bulls were in fair numbers and the top three or four were high yield. It is unlikely that cow numbers will increase from here to November and the expectation from agents is that all numbers will fall away in the next week or two.

It was again a very strong market for young cattle with the restocker weaner steers and the heifer vealers selling at exactly the same prices as in last weeks strong showing. Demand for quality young cattle is still at a very steady level as there is a definite shortage of the better bred store cattle. Trade cattle sold at very even levels when compared to last sale.

The bullocks yarded in this sale were well in front of the cattle yarded in the past few weeks with the yield potential one or two per cent higher. Cows were very average quality with no top yielders yarded other than in single sales. Bulls were steady in value with prices even but not outstanding."
"A very mixed quality penning to wind up sales for the year. Included in the number were 72 bulls and 100 plain condition light weight young cattle. Those young cattle were sold on a dollars per head basis and not included in this report. They did however sell extremely well. There was a reduced field of processors operating however a very active group of restocker orders competed strongly.

With a break in sales and paddocks full of feed the market for young cattle returning to the paddock was strong with most categories selling to dearer trends. The mixed quality nature of the offering did contribute to some negative price change.

Grown steers and heifers to process sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend while those to feedlots met strong competition and saw improvement in places. There was a slightly cheaper trend in the cow market. Bulls also sold to cheaper trends as processors wind down in preparation for the Christmas/ New year period."
"A surprising fall in numbers greeted the full field of buyers with most expecting the yarding to be closer to 3000 head due to the continuing dry spell. Weaners and vealers were in the biggest numbers with many less feeder steers and restocker and trade yearlings in the yarding. High yielding cows and quality bullocks were limited to only an odd pen. Feeder heifers were well supplied with their quality only average. Overall quality was similar to the previous week with possibly a few less pens of the best bred weaner steers available. 

Restocker steer weaners met a fair enquiry but the enthusiastic bidding of previous weeks was lacking. Steer weaners and heifer vealers were cheaper in a range of 7c to 10c/kg with few exceptions noted. Plain yearling heifers were cheaper but there were not enough quality trade cattle available to quote any alteration. Feeder heifers sold at cheaper rates with some of the northern orders less active.

The few bullocks yarded were plain bred and in insufficient numbers for a reliable market quote. Heavy export heifers sold steadily at almost firm rates but all grades in cows were cheaper by 2c to 4c/kg. Bull prices cheapened while export weight feeder steers met good demand to sell at firm values."
"A sudden drop in numbers characterized the northern cattle markets this week with this market no exception. There were very few prime cattle yarded but there were good numbers of well bred weaners and yearlings and a few good pens of yearling feeder steers. There were also many more plain light cows yarded but only a few pens of tradeweight cattle of either sex.

There was a keen demand for steer weaners from mainly local restockers, with the medium and lightweight cattle carrying the strongest demand and selling 2c to 3c/kg dearer. The heavier weights sold at firm prices.  Heifer vealer prices were very consistent and most were between 2c and 5c/kg dearer with plenty of bidding a feature. The very few tradeweight yearlings yarded sold at firm rates for the slightly improved quality on offer.

There were no young bullocks yarded but the heavier export feeder steers sold at slightly dearer rates averaging 3c to 4c/kg dearer. Medium and heavyweight cows sold at fully firm rates but the light cows, due to restocker competition, sold at dearer prices for the greater number available. The bull yarding was very plain but the prices were unchanged."
"A smaller yarding this week at 1350, but the quality of last sale wasn't repeated this week. Well over half the yarding were light and medium vealers and yearling milk tooth steers. All were sold to restockers. With few exceptions, the trend was again cheaper, with export cattle of all grades, 2 and up to 5 cents cheaper. All yearlings were 1 to 3 cents cheaper. Two score veal was firm to 3 cents dearer with the restock influence the cause of the rise.  It should be noted that most of the yearling steers and all of the steer calves are going, either on to grass or to feedlots. Over the last month this has become a significant market trend in most Northern sales."
"A smaller yarding this week after more good rain with the market slightly better for almost all descriptions. The quality of all the young stock and the heavy steers and bullocks was right up to last week, but there weren't as many good cows. Market improvement of 1 to 2 c/kg were fairly common, with restock orders increased and having a big effect on all steers, yearling and older. Feedlots were not as prominent as it appears their limits were being overshadowed by the grassfed Restockers."
"A smaller yarding at 1040, the drop in numbers expected in mid winter. There was not much change in quality, other than in steer weaners which were plainer, and light and medium bullocks which were better finished. It was a good and strong market for trade cattle and heifer vealers, which are in fact better covered than the steers, with values for these types firm to dearer. Restock steer weaners lost ground, mainly on a lack of quality, but the middle weight yearling off restock steers were a little stronger.

Bullocks were fair quality and dearer, but with one Operator out of the market, the light and medium cows were 4 to 7c/kg cheaper, and heavy cows 1 to4c/kg cheaper.
Feedlot competition was increased across all weights."
"A smaller offering of 420 head, was down 220 on last week. It was a mixed quality offering that saw a very good lineup of medium and heavyweight cows as well as some good quality yearling steers suitable for restockers. All regular buyers were in attendance with the inclusion of an export processor after an absence of some months.

Restockers drove the yearling steer market upwards, showing confidence in the season and the future market. The good quality lightweight steers sold 20c/kg dearer. The plain quality lightweights also sold dearer. Medium weight yearling steers to restockers sold to a dearer trend also, up 5c/kg. Lightweight yearling heifers to the trade sold to a dearer trend, with spirited bidding from the usual buyers, up 14c to 16c/kg. Restockers were also active on the plain condition and quality heifers at dearer rates.

The inclusion of an extra export operator had little effect on what was a very strong grown cattle market as they were not interested at the rates being paid. There were no heavyweight steers to quote. Grown heifers sold firm to 4c/kg dearer. A very good quality offering of cows sold to a dearer trend, this included a small number of plain condition cows. The plain cows sold 5c to 8c dearer, medium weight 3 and 4 score cows sold 5c to 7c dearer with heavy weight cows up to 10c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls sold firm."
"A smaller number of cattle were yarded compared to last week, a symptom of the usual winter cattle shortage which occurs every season at this time. It was almost a total restocker and feeder cattle yarding with weaners and yearlings making up 90% of the overall offering. Quality was not up to the previous two weeks standards. There were no trade cattle and no heavy steers or bullocks yarded and only a few pens of cows were yarded.

The demand from restockers and also from feedlots was almost unprecedented with values rising each week since the rain. Prices for steer weaners, heifer weaners, restocker yearling steers and feeder steers were dearer by 7c to 15c/kg with local competition providing the major impetus to the price rise. The lighter D muscle young cattle received considerably strong competition from local hobby farmers at the expense of the better bred types.

The only quote possible in older cattle is for the three score cows which were dearer by 6c to 8c/kg. Apart from a single heavily muscled bull, there were no other export cattle yarded."
"A small numbers increase to 1575, together with a quality increase across all descriptions except the cows which presented in similar numbers and quality to last sale. It was another large percentage of 2 and 3 score vealer calves offerred, with the average weight and softnessincreased just a little. The trend in most sales was dearer, with bullocks and yearling steers showing to greatest rise and the only loss recorded was in yearling heifers, particularily the unfinished type.
   
There was again strong restock competition on weaner steers and heifers and yearling steers, with the 2 score cows also attracting some restock interest."
"A small increase in numbers, however they remain a long way below levels normally seen at this time of the year. The most likely reason for this is the excellent seasonal conditions giving producers the opportunity to hold their cattle back and increase weight. There was an increased supply of vealers, the quality good, with weight increased. All other categories were represented and all the usual buyers were back on deck.

Competition and demand for young cattle was strong from both processors and finishers. Vealers sold to a dearer trend, up 5c to 8c/kg to both restockers and the trade. Yearling steers to restock and feed benefited from the re-introduction into the market of an order absent for a couple of weeks with the market trend 6c to 15c/kg and more in places. The dearer trend carried onto the heifer yearlings, however not to the same extent. The trend was firm to 4c/kg dearer.

There was an increased supply of heavy grown steers and manufacturing bullocks. The market for grown steers saw little change. The quality of the penning of cows was good with the majority falling into the heavy weight classes. The good season saw some cows overdone. The market trend was dearer, up 4c to 8c/kg and more in places, particularly the 5 score cows. There was a drop in competition for plain condition cows with these selling to a cheaper trend. Heavy bulls sold significantly dearer."
"A slightly reduced number on cattle were yarded for the short week. There was a good supply of well bred vealers, while the quality of the yearlings was mixed. There were few heavy steers, with grown heifers in greater than normal numbers. All regular processors were in attendance and operating.

Restocker demand was weaker than in previous sales, with the cooling of temperatures a likely contributing factor. Vealer steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend, down 12c to 18c/kg. Quality was back and this had an influence on prices, particularly in the heavier weight ranges. Heifer vealers also sold to a cheaper trend with quite a few having lost the pre Easter bloom. The limited supply of fresh heifer vealers remained close to firm. 

Quality was a contributing factor in the cheaper prices seen for yearling steers to restock and feed, with prices down 10c to 15c/kg and more in places. An increased number of lightweight yearling heifers were on offer and sold to restockers at a dearer price trend, this was more to do with quality than anything else. The trade yearling heifers sold to a cheaper trend.

The few heavy steers and bullocks sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 6c/kg. The average quality of the grown heifers was only fair, with this reflected in the price. The cow market followed the trend of the sale to record a 5c to 6c/kg cheaper trend with quality accounting for any other price change."
"A slightly increased offering of fair to good quality cattle was offered. Condition varied with some well finished yearling heifers and out of season vealers penned. Most of the regular buyers were in attendance. 

The market was strong with restockers particularly active. Vealers sold to a dearer trend, as did the lightweight yearlings steers to restockers. Heifer yearlings sold at firm rates to both the trade and restockers. 

Hardly any heavy grown steers were yarded and the cow market realised a dearer trend. Well finished heavy cows sold up to 2c higher, while the portion to restockers up to 10c/kg dearer."
"A slightly bigger yarding at 1240, but a very plain quality offering throughout, with very few cattle with any real finish.  A cheaper market, through most categories, resulted, with a percentage of the market falls obviously caused by the sudden quality reduction.  Most of the yarding were weaners and plain yearlings, and there were no bullocks . Cows were in less numbers, but there were a few pens of heavy steers. The very light cows showed the biggest price falls, while the best cows were the only cattle at near to firm rates.

Restock demand has waned over the last few weeks, and this sale was no exception."
"A slight increase in numbers, but still a smaller yarding than is usual at the time of year. The reason for the lack of numbers being the good season coupled with only a moderate market, and therefore no great incentive to offer cattle for sale. Low numbers often mean improved values and this sale was no exception with all but the plainest yearlings 1 to 3 cents dearer. Heavy steers, the few bullocks and cows 1 to 3 cents dearer and overfat cows up by 4 cents. Restockers were active on all steers up to two tooth. Prime young cattle were scarce but good cows and heavy steers were in fair numbers."
"A similar sized yarding to that of a fortnight ago was offered. The yarding was dominated by cows and lighter weights. Similar to other markets across the state, only a limited number of steers and bullocks were penned. A full panel of active buyers was present and values were firm to slightly dearer. A fair percentage of the yarding was plainer or leaner lines although there was the odd pen of good quality scattered throughout. 

Restockers and feeders competed strongly with the trade buyers on the young cattle. Medium weight vealer steers to slaughter averaged just under 170c as restockers paid to 207.2c/kg for light weights. Vealer heifers to 171.2c as yearling heifers made to 168.2c/kg. 

The small supply of steers and bullocks sold to strong demand with medium weights to 177.2c/kg. Plainer D muscled medium weights sold to 156.6c as the top of the heavy steers reached 186.2c/kg. 

Cows also met some solid competition from restockers with most grades selling to an improved market. Large numbers of light cows sold to 113.2c as restockers paid to 110.2c/kg. Medium weight D3s averaged just over 125c as D4s sold to 134c/kg. A good pen of 12 heavy weights topped at 138.6c/kg. 

The top price for the sale was 207.2c/kg for a pen of eight Charolais cross vealer steers."
"A similar number of cattle this week at 810 with the quality just a little better, but the average is still plain and will remain so until the feed matures a little. Most types of cattle were either firm or a fraction cheaper with yearling heifers an exception at a few cents dearer. Heavy steers were  cheaper but the lack of quality finish would account for the loss. There were quite a few pens of export feeder steers yarded, and they sold to a dearer trend, under good competition."
"A sharp increase in supply with a greater percentage of weaners penned. Young cattle were well represented as were cows while there was a limited supply of heavy grown cattle. Overall the quality of the offering was generally good. The condition varied greatly particularly in the cows. There was an increased attendance of processors while there were a few restocker and feeders returning after a short absence. 

With plenty of upcoming weaner sales across the tablelands demand for the weaners was not as great as the previous sale and as a consequence market trends were much cheaper through both the steers and the heifers. The increased competition saw medium and heavy weight yearling steers sell to dearer trends, posting strong gains in places.  Good quality yearling heifers also sold to dearer trends with a greater preference shown for the heavier weights.

Well finished grown steers sold to dearer trends under strong processor demand. The grown heifers in prime condition were also keenly sought to be much dearer.  A strong cow market throughout with the plainer condition cows showing the greater improvement. The well finished cows saw a firm to slightly dearer trend. A strong bull market with some outstanding heavy weights penned."
"A reduction in numbers with young cattle well supplied along with a fair selection of cows. The quality of the offering was very mixed as was the condition. There were some well finished cattle through all categories. All regular processors were in attendance although not all chose to operate. The regular restocker and feedlot operators were also in attendance.

The young cattle market saw trends cheaper throughout with steer vealers to restock showing little variations. Light and heavy weights saw quite a reduction in price while an odd pen of medium weights remained firm. For the most part however the trend was cheaper. This trend followed through to the heifer vealers to the trade with the well finished lines most affected. There was a bit of restocker competition that saw the better quality lines hold up quite well. Yearling steers to restock met with a bit of buyer reluctance, given the increasing number of weaners available with the trend 15c to 20c/kg cheaper. There were quality related price variations evident in the market for heifer yearlings with the overall trend cheaper.

Heavy grown steers and heifers carrying sufficient fat cover and yield potential saw little change in price or trend. The cow market saw cheaper trends throughout, down 5c to 11c/kg in the lead up to a couple of short working weeks."
"A reduction in numbers by 25% was evident with a large penning of vealers, while cows were also well supplied. All other categories were represented in reduced numbers. The overall quality of the offering was very mixed. Condition tended to be plain with few well finished lots other than a small number of cows and heavy steers. The regular restocker and feeder orders were in place along with some extra buyers operating throughout most classes. There was limited processor activity with most cattle suited to restocker orders.

A variable market trend was apparent through the young cattle with the good quality well-bred steer vealers to restock selling to a dearer trend, up5c/kg regardless of weight and muscle definition. The plain quality steers to restock sold to a cheaper trend with limited competition. Heifer vealers sold to a cheaper trend with processors showing interest in only those lots showing finish. Trends through the yearling steers to restock and feed varied with light and heavy weights selling to a dearer trend, some of that quality related. The medium weights sold to a cheaper trend with quality also contributing. Heifer yearlings also attracted reduced demand from restockers to sell to a cheaper trend while those selling to the trade with some finish also struggled to hold similar price levels.

There was a fair supply of grown steers, however very few heavyweights. The trend for the heavy steers to process was cheaper, averaging 8c/kg lower. An erratic market for those to restock and feed with the plain quality lighter weights making more than the better quality lots at times. Restocker activity was again high in the cow market with one order showing little regard for finish, operating in all fat classes to fill requirements. The market however could not maintain the level of the previous week selling to a cheaper trend by up to 10c/kg. There was not a lot of movement in the market for the better cows to process."
"A reduced yarding of 1430 cattle, 300 less. It does appear that the vealer season is drawing to a close, as only 200 were yarded this week. Quality in the vealers, weaners and yearling cattle was well back on last sale. There were only a few steers and no bullocks. Cows however were in big numbers and met very strong competition with a good percentage of good high yielding cows yarded. A stronger market was seen for all the slaughter cattle in veal and trade with these types very short supplied this week.
    
Restockers and Feeders were again very active, buying both steers and yearling heifers to feed on."
"A reduced penning with good follow up rain recorded late last week. This was the second last sale for this centre before the Christmas break. The quality of the offering was very mixed with limited numbers of well finished young cattle. There was a good top in the penning of cows along with fair numbers of plain condition cows. Young cattle were well supplied in front of a restricted field of trade and export buyers. There was decent support from both restocker and feedlot order with varying trends apparent due to limited trade and export interest in some but certainly not all categories.

Good quality lightweight steer vealers to restockers sold to a dearer trend, with all other vealers to process were cheaper due to the limited competition. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw the better quality lightweights sell to a slightly cheaper trend, while the plain quality very lightweights were dearer. Buyers were looking to limit their dollar outlay by purchasing the very lightweight cattle. Demand for medium and heavy yearling steers to restock and feed was strong with medium weights up to 9c/kg dearer. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed generally sold to a dearer trend however there was some quality related price change.

A limited supply of heavy grown steers remained close to firm with some quality related changes. Well finished heavy grown heifers varied a little with the best remaining firm, while those deemed to be a little over finished were cheaper, once again the limited competition had an effect. Competition between export processors was keen for the well finished medium and heavy cows, while the prices were in the range of the previous sale. Overall the cows were not quite as good, as a result the trend was dearer with some sales up quite a bit. Competition for the plainer condition light and medium weight cows was not as strong and they mostly sold to a slightly cheaper trend."
"A reduced penning that saw young cattle well supplied. The quality and condition of the offering showed a great variation and was reflected in price ranges. There were very few young cattle suitable to the trade. Processor competition was reduced, particularly noticeable in the cow market. Increased restocker competition.

Market trends varied through the young cattle, where the good quality steer vealers to restockers sold to dearer trends for the most part. There were breed premiums and discounts, while the plainer quality and mixed breed pens were also discounted. The heifer vealers to restockers experienced strong gains, once again very plain quality lots were severely discounted. A drop in quality was the driving factor in a cheaper market trend for yearling steers to restock and feed with significant falls recorded. Plain quality yearling heifers sold to a much cheaper trend with a vast range in price between these and the well bred heifers suitable to feed. The better quality heifers suitable to feed also sold to a cheaper trend, however the falls were not as great.

Lightly muscled, lean condition grown heifers displaying good frame attracted strong competition from restockers looking to feed a grain ration. The market for those heifers was dearer, while the plainer small framed heifers sold to a cheaper trend. The reduced processor competition for well finished cows resulted in a cheaper trend of 10c to 15c/kg on the 3 and 4 scores. The plainer condition 1 and 2 score cows also sold to cheaper trends. The plainest quality cows struggled to attract much competition at all. Heavy bulls saw strong competition between a live export order and processors, resulting in a slightly dearer market trend."
"A reduced penning that saw all categories represented. The quality of the offering was mostly good, while a large percentage were forward in condition. These showing the benefit of crops. All regular buyers were in attendance.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with vealer steers to restockers showing  a cheaper trend. This carried through all weight classes. The better quality light weight vealer heifers to restockers posted strong gains, the heavier weights however saw a cheaper trend. Light weight yearling steers saw little change, the medium weight feeders were slightly cheaper. Yearling heifers to restock and feed saw little change apart from quality. Well finished tarde heifers also remained firm.

There were some very good quality, well finished heavy grown steers penned. These attracted strong competition from both processors and feedlotters, eventually purchased to go onto feed. Both quality and condition contributing to a dearer trend. Well finished grown heifers sold to dearer trends. There was increased competition in the cow market with dearer trends of 10c to 20c/kg and more in places. Restockers were particularly keen on a few pens of PTIC cows pushing prices well in excess of similar cows to process. Heavy bulls sold to cheaper trends."
"A reduced number were offered. The quality and condition of the penning was generally plain with a few handy yearling steers and heifers. There were no finished grown steers and only a small penning of cows. There was a limited buying group in attendance and restockers bought most of the young cattle.

The market trend for yearling steers to restock was considerably cheaper with the quality available contributing to much of the price falls. This trend carried through to the heifer yearlings and once again quality accounted for significant price falls.

The cow market saw odd pens of the better cows hold value."
"A rain reduced penning of 565 head. Cows and heifers were well supplied while there were limited numbers of steers. The quality of the young cattle was very mixed while there was a very good quality penning of heavy weight cows.  Most of the usual buyers were in attendance and restocker activity was high.

The limited number of vealers sold to restockers on a cheaper trend with quality a factor. Heavy yearling steers to restock and feed sold to cheaper trends. Medium weight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold to a slightly dearer trend under solid competition. Heavy weights also sold to a slightly dearer trend.

The majority of the grown steers were purchased for further finishing, those to process remained firm. Well finished grown heifers to process sold firm to slightly cheaper. There were dearer trends through the cow market with the quality contributing to some strong average gains."
"A rain reduced offering with numbers falling by 700 head. The quality of the offering was very mixed with young cattle well represented. There was a much larger percentage of vealers and weaners penned. Cows made up the bulk of the grown cattle offering. Condition varied with very few well finished young cattle. The best condition was displayed by the older cattle. The lower numbers saw a reduction in the buying ranks with some processors not attending and some of the regular restocker and feeder orders absent.

Restocker buyers showed a strong preference for good quality weaners. The steer portion experienced a significantly dearer market trend with a very obvious bias towards the well bred lines showing in the price range. The heifer portion followed a similar trend however the improvement was not as great. There was little feedlot competition on yearling steers with market trends cheaper throughout all weight categories. The mixed quality nature of the penning was a factor in price change. Heifer yearlings varied a little with the light weights not as keenly sought as the medium and heavy weights. All classes showing firm to slightly cheaper trends under reduced competition.

Not a lot of change in the market for the small number of heavy grown steers suitable to process. The grown heifers sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Medium weight cows sold to a dearer trend while there was little change in the well finished heavy weights. A large supply of bulls sold to cheaper trends."
"A plainer yarding this week, with fewer quality yearlings to pick from. Most of the yarding were cows, plain young steers and heifers, with just a few pens of older steers. The enquiry was a little less enthusiastic, and the values dropped for all descriptions,w ith the greatest falls showing up in plain one year old steers, and trade heifers the same age."
"A number of very recent store cattle sales in Armidale may well have taken the edge off the yarding size. Fat atock were in the minority as the bulk of the cattle were bought by restockers, mostly local, and by feedlots. Weaners were in the greatest percentage of the yarding, while cows were also well represented. There were also a few pens of well fattened medium weight bullocks yarded, but trade cattle were in a very light supply.

The usual buyers attended the sale but some of the buyers of export cattle were much less active. Restocker demand accounted for a very large percentage of the buying power on young cattle. Light steer weaners under 200kg were dearer as were the weaner and vealer heifers. The steer weaners over and under 200kg, all went to restockers, with the heavier steer weaners selling at firm prices.

Demand for light conditioned cows, either joined or unjoined, was extremely strong, and prices were fully firm to slightly dearer. The killable medium cows sold to a cheaper trend of up to 6c/kg. There was a decided drop in demand for the bullocks which averaged 8c/kg cheaper as did the export weight feeder steers. The bull prices did not alter.

The top sale price was 216c/kg paid by a restocker for very light weight steer weaners."
"A mixed quality offering with a small number of each catergory. Cows were best represented and made up 37% of the offering. Not all regular buyers were in attendance, due to the lack of numbers.

The market was strong throughout with restockers and processors competing well on all young cattle. The quality of the young cattle was showing the effects of a recent cold snap. Light yearling steers to restockers sold firm to a little dearer. It was a similar story with the heifer yearlings both to restockers and processors.

There were very few heavyweight steers offered, what was avaliable sold to a dearer trend. The cow market was also very strong, with all grades selling to a dearer trend. Restockers were active on the plain condition cows with rates showing significant improvement. Heavyweight bulls sold to a dearer trend."
"A mixed quality much smaller offering of 140 cattle sold to less buyers present but there was spirited competition at times helped by feeders and local restockers. The majority of the yarding consisted of cows from average to very good and a mixed but mostly good selection of bulls. There was also a  limited supply of young and grown cattle compared to a fortnight ago.

 A couple of vealer pens sold stronger with the light weight vealer heifers selling to 522c and the steer vealers to 574c/kg. The yearling steers sold dearer, yearling heifers and grown cattle sold to equal, heavy cows fluctuated slightly and averaged unchanged to 10c dearer reaching a top of 298c/kg. Leaner and plain lighter cows to restockers were slightly easier although selling mainly from 268c to 346c and up to 370c/kg. Bulls sold to steady competition selling from 5c to 20c/kg dearer. 

Yearling steers sold from 424c to 531c, good quality yearling heifers made from 400c to 460c and heifers suiting  feeders made from 360c to 464c/kg. The few grown steers made from 320c to 380c with a restocker paying to 400c/kg. Two pens of dairy cross manufacturing steers sold from 294c to 302c/kg. Grown heifers mostly went to restockers and made from 250c to 422c with processors paying to 347c/kg. Heavy cows sold from 249c to 298c and the heavy bulls made from 250c to 300c/kg.

Market Reporter, Tim Delany."
"A long run of heavy frosts has taken a lot of condition off most cattle and the yarding, consequently, is much lighter in weight and condition than earlier in the season. Most of the yarding were weaners and yearlings and the average quality was again well down on the previous week. The best conditioned cattle available were a number of pens of yearling trade heifers off green crop but there were insufficient bullocks or cows to quote a market.

Demand from local growers was limited as the season deteriorates and the cold nights tend to slow down demand on some descriptions of cattle. Weaner demand fell away and the market price was 15c to 20c/kg easier. Yearling cattle to restockers and feeders faced a good demand being better able to handle the seasonal conditions, and some were 8c/12c/kg dearer. The trade heifer yearlings sold at steady values.

There can be no quote available on bullocks or on cows due to a lack of numbers and the bull values were cheaper by 10c to 15c/kg on a plain quality yarding."
"A little rain reduced the yarding, with vealers in good supply. There were a few heavy grown steers and a fair number of cows. The quality was very mixed, while there were some well finished lots available to the trade and export processors. The regular buyers were in attendance.

Restocker confidence lifted with steer vealers selling to a dearer trend, up 3c to 10c/kg. Heavy trade vealer steers were cheaper for quality. There was increased demand for heifer vealers also, with both restockers and processors more active. The market trend was dearer, up 6c to 13c/kg with odd sales of the better quality lots showing a little more. Good quality medium weight yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend. Medium and heavy trade yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend also. Secondary quality lots of young cattle were cheaper.

An improved average quality penning of heavy grown steers sold to a cheaper trend with the quality of the offering lifting the price change. The quality of the cows was quite mixed with this having some effect on price change in a market that showed slightly cheaper trends."
"A little rain over the area saw confidence boosted and a reduction in the numbers yarded. It was a very mixed quality penning with cows making up 30%, with a small number of heavy grown steers and a fair supply of grown heifers. The young cattle were generally of plain quality and condition. Not all regular processors were operating, however there was good restocker demand and competition. Trends varied throughout the sale.

Lightweight yearling steers to restock sold to a dearer trend, with plain quality and conditioned lines showing significant price improvement trending dearer, up 20c/kg and more in places. The better quality C muscled lines carrying more weight also sold to a dearer trend, although not as much, averaging 6c/kg higher. Medium weight yearling steers sold to a firm market trend with a quality related price variation. Lightweight yearling heifers sold to a dearer trend, to average 3c to 8c/kg higher. Quality variations were evident in odd classes.

The few well finished heavy grown steers sold firm to slightly cheaper with restricted competition due to the low numbers. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend with quality contributing. The best of the heavy cows saw little change in the market trend. The medium weight 3 score cows sold to a cheaper trend. There was increased demand from restockers on the better quality cows in store condition, although there were no sales from the previous week to make a market comparison. Plain conditioned cows to process generally sold to a cheaper trend with an isolated sale remaining firm."
"A lighter yarding was expected following very good district rain and smaller yardings are anticipated on the run up to the Christmas/New Year break. The quality of the yarding was average only with very light vealers and yearling steers and heifers making up the bulk of those offered. Heavy steers and bullocks were very light in numbers and quality while there were fair cow numbers available. There were a few pens of yearling steers that were well finished but they were all bought by feedlots.

There was a very considerable variation evident in the market prices with very light vealers under 200kg selling at fully firm rates. In an unexpected occurrence the very light and trade yearling heifers sold at much higher prices than in recent weeks. Very light feeder steers also sold at firm rates but the heavier types were cheaper and the demand for them was much less enthusiastic. There were few pens of restocker steers available and they sold to their usual steady price.

The lack of quality and numbers in bullocks and heavy steers made for a difficulty in quoting variations but there were indications of a definite easing in price. There was a variation the cow price with most cows between 5 and 12c/kg cheaper with light cows losing the least amount of value. The bulls were cheaper by 10c/kg. 

The top sale price was 273.2c/kg paid for very light weight vealers."
"A large line of medium and heavy weight yearling heifers were a feature in an increased penning this week. Surprisingly there were very few weaners penned, while most other categories were represented. The quality was fair to good as was condition. The regular buyers were in attendance and there was extra competition on those heifers.

There were insufficient weaners for a market comparison. Light weight yearling steers to restockers sold to a cheaper trend with quality a factor. The medium weights to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend, up to 20c/kg with quality also improving. Heavy weight yearling feeder steers experienced weaker demand, selling to a cheaper trend, up to 10c/kg. Those medium and heavy weight yearling heifers attracted increased feedlot competition to show a slightly dearer market trend with a vast improvement in quality. A small number purchased by the trade were also dearer.

Heavy grown steers purchased by feedlotters sold firm to slightly dearer with an improvement in both quality and condition, they also attracted processor competition. Well finished grown heifers were firm to 7c/kg dearer with some very well finished, high quality lots available. The cow market was firm to 2c/kg dearer for a much reduced penning. Demand for heavy bulls was weaker, resulting in a cheaper trend of as much as 10c/kg."
"A hint of rain over the coming weekend saw numbers reduce. The quality and condition of the young cattle was generally plain with only a small number of yearling heifers carrying sufficient finish for the trade. The same processors as the previous week were in attendance and there were a few restockers active.

Lightweight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a slightly dearer trend to 10c higher on 203c/kg. Heifer yearlings in the lightweight class sold firm to 2c/kg cheaper. Heavy 3 score heifer yearlings sold at similar prices to last week. 

There were insufficient grown steers and heifers to quote a trend. The medium and heavy cows sold firm to 3c/kg dearer with the exception of the heavy 5 scores that were slightly cheaper."
"A hint of rain combined with the state of recent markets saw numbers fall by 1,700 head. The quality of the offering was very mixed. There was a large percentage of plain condition cattle penned alongside some well finished young cattle, heavy steers and cows. Most of the regular export processors were in attendance, however not all trade buyers were able to operate due to the large numbers being offered across most saleyards placing pressure on processing times. Restocker activity was brighter and spanned across all categories. Trends were dearer throughout with the lower numbers easing pressure on processors, while restockers took the opportunity to buy in at reasonably low prices.

Vealer steers to restock sold to a dearer trend with strong price gains for well-bred lines. A sale of 200c/kg was for a steer to be prepared for the show circuit. Heifer vealers to process sold to a cheaper trend due to a reduction in competition, while the well finished heavy trade vealers were dearer. Yearling steers attracted increased restocker competition selling to a dearer trend with averages 5c to 30c/kg dearer. The dearer trend carried through to the heifer yearlings also with the plainer quality and condition lightweights showing strong gains. The better quality heifers carrying more weight also sold to a dearer trend however there was some average quality variation evident in price changes.

The heavy grown steers to process sold firm for an improved quality offering in most cases. There was quite a turnaround in the plain condition light and medium weight cow market with improved quality and increased restocker activity contributing to a much dearer market trend. The better 3 and 4 score cows remained firm with odd sales slightly dearer."
"A greatly reduced penning was apparent after some useful rainfall over the district. There was a large penning of cows and vealers once again, with limited numbers through the other categories. Overall the quality was fair throughout most categories with some well bred vealers showing the effects of the season. A large gallery of buyers were in attendance with a few new orders, while there was extra export processor activity.

Restocker confidence showed a boost after the rain, resulting in dearer trends through the young cattle. Lightweight vealers to restock saw steers up 20c-30c/kg and more in places with a couple of extraordinary sales late in the market. There was little change in the market for medium weights representing a greater dollar per head value. The dearer trend carried through to the lightweight heifer vealers, with lightweights 25c to 30c dearer and the medium weights up to 18c/kg dearer. Yearling steers and heifers to restock and feed also benefited from the rain with the dearer trends carrying through to all classes. The quality of the penning was below the previous week. Limited numbers of heifers suitable to the trade were also significantly dearer.

There were too few heavy steers or well finished grown heifers to quote a trend. An amazing turn around in the cow market was seen for both the plain condition and well finished lots. Strong demand from both restockers and processors for the plain condition lots and increased competition for well finished cows saw market trends around 20c/kg dearer across most classes."
"A further reduction in numbers. Vealers and light weight yearlings were well supplied along with some very good cows. Overall the quality of the offering was good albeit mixed for breed. Condition was fair to good with all buyers able to operate.

There was strong breed specific demand from local restockers which resulted in steers under 330kg selling to dearer trends and posting strong gains. There was also some breed related improvement in the heifer weaners. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold on a dearer market than a fortnight ago whilst showing some quality related price change in places. Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend.

Well finished heavy grown steers to process sold to a slightly cheaper trend with some weight and quality related price change. The best of the heavy weight grown heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend. There was strong demand for cows with restockers active on those lighter in condition. Well finished heavy weights attracted strong processor competition with trends as much as 15c/kg dearer than a fortnight ago. Heavy bulls sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend."
"A few more frosts and no rain forecast saw producers offload in greater numbers. There was a large penning of cows with both vealers and yearlings also well supplied. There was also a fair selection of well finished cattle. Overall the quality of the offering was good, however condition was mostly on the lean side. In a sign of the season there was a line of young calves offered, having been taken off heifers. Most of the usual processors were in attendance along with an extra operating on vealers and cows.

Restocker demand was weaker, not so feeder activity. Vealer steers to restockers saw the reduced competition impact on prices by as much as 30c/kg. The heifer portion was not as badly affected with the trend 20c to 26c/kg cheaper. There was a great range in breed and quality that also affected prices. Extra competition for feeder cattle saw the medium and heavy weight yearling steers sell to a much dearer trend. The better quality yearling heifers to feed also sold to a dearer trend however quality variations saw average prices down. Secondary quality cattle and those not suitable to go onto grain rations were increasingly harder to sell.

With drought conditions well and truly taking hold there were premiums for well finished cattle. This saw well finished grown steers and heifers dearer. A large number of plain condition cows saw a cheaper market trend of 15c to 16c/kg with the plainest condition cows most affected. The well finished cows generally sold to a firm trend with an odd dearer sale."
"A few more cattle were yarded this week, which provided an improvement in quality on the trade yearlings and heavy steers and bullocks, the latter presenting in small lots only.  The cow yarding was plainer than the last sale,  with very few high yield cows yarded.  The plain store cattle made up the biggest percentage of all.

Another strong market was seen for the good trade yearlings, all selling at better rates, while the plainer types lacked quality,  hence the cheaper values shown.

Export steers sold to a stronger market, some of that extra demand was caused by the short numbers that were offered,  while cows and bulls also displayed a firm to dearer trend which continued  the trends seen earlier in the week, across the northern saleyards."
"A fair to good quality yarding with double the numbers. Yearlings made up the bulk of the offering with a much bigger penning of cows. There were limited numbers of trade yearlings with most of the young cattle purchased by restocker and feedlot interests. The full compliment of regular buyers were in attendance.

The market trend for yearlings to the trade was generally firm for the better muscled grades, improved average quality accounting for price increases. The plainer muscled grades sold to a cheaper trend, down 4c to 6c/kg, increased numbers affecting averages. Good quality feeder yearlings sold firm to slightly dearer on last week with greater numbers of yearling heifers penned. The plainer muscle restocker and feeder yearlings sold on a variable market, generally cheaper by 2c to 4c/kg, however breed quality played a part in seeing some of the lighter steers sell a little dearer.

A full field of export processors competed strongly for the increased numbers and improved quality offering of cows. There were insufficient numbers of quality heavy steers to quote. The cow market saw a dearer trend with the medium and heavy grades up 13c to 20c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to a dearer trend up 14c/kg."
"A fair to good quality offering of cattle were penned and numbers were similar to the previous sale two weeks ago. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering with vealers in large numbers. There was a fair penning of grown steers and heifers. The regular orders were in place for a market that saw a fair correction from the previous sale.

Steer vealers to restock sold significantly cheaper with all weight categories equally affected. The sheer weight of numbers coming forward throughout the region took a toll on demand. Heifer vealers also affected with the market trend up to 17c/kg cheaper. Yearling steers to restock and feed saw a similar trend for the light and medium weights while the heavier end was less affected. Heifer yearlings to restock and feed were only slightly cheaper, however those to the trade were 14c/kg cheaper and more in places.

There was a reasonably good quality penning of heavy steers and they saw little change in the market. Grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend. The cow market lost ground to show a cheaper trend, down as much as 12c/kg."
"A couple of early frosts saw numbers increase by 500 head. Once again vealers, yearlings and cows made up the bulk of the offering. Overall the quality was fair to good although there was a lack of bloom in the majority of the cattle, brought about by the colder weather. The increase in cow numbers also brought about a greater variation in quality. 

Mostly the young cattle market was solid. Restocker weaner steer sold firm to 6c/kg dearer through all weight ranges, a very small number of light steers slightly more. The light heifer vealers and those on the bottom end of the medium weight ranges sold to a cheaper trend, down 8c to 13c/kg. There was a bit more restocker activity on the plainer conditioned heifers although this did little to change the market trend. A small number of heavier well finished heifer vealers sold at slightly improved rates. There was not a great deal of quality in the yearling steer offering, most going to restocker and feeder orders at rates 2c to 8c/kg cheaper than last sale. It was a similar story with the yearling heifers, quality slipping. The market remained similar to last week.

The limited number of heavy steers sold to a dearer trend, particularly those with 2 or less teeth, up to 10c/kg dearer. The best heavy heifers sold to a dearer trend, the balance unchanged. Cow numbers doubled this week and despite the absence of 1 buyer the market improved, the trend 1c to 4c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls sold slightly cheaper."
"A continuation of heavy frosts has forced some growers to reduce numbers; this is not an unusual occurrence at this time of year. There were some very good quality weaners yarded, but generally quality was only average. At this time of year, weaners make up the bulk of the yarding, and this sale was no exception. Cows were well supplied but there were few high yielding types amongst them. Bullocks were mainly two tooth and younger, but most required a greater amount of finishing.

Bidding was not as strong on restocker and younger cattle as it has been in previous sales. Heavy steer weaners were slightly cheaper while lightweights were fully firm. Heifer vealers sold at firm to marginally dearer rates, while restocker and feeder yearling steers were fully firm under good enquiry. Trade steers were solid but the heifer portion, even though of a lower yield, were cheaper by up to 5c/kg.

Light bullocks and some heavier older types, sold at firm rates under fair demand. Heavy heifers were firm to slightly cheaper while demand for all cows, except a few lightweights, were reduced and the market was 5c to 7c/kg cheaper. In a reverse trend, bulls were 3c/kg dearer.

The top sale price of 209.2c/kg was paid by a restocker for lightweight steer weaners."
"
Numbers were normal following close to 25mm of rain over the area. Fat quality except for a few pens was plain but there were some very well bred cattle yarded. The bulk of the yarding was made up from weaners and yearlings with quality cows very short and only a few pens of heavy steers and bullocks were available. The usual buyers of slaughter cattle were present together with an increased number of store buyers.

The trend in the young cattle was towards a dearer market. The best bred steer weaners showed an outstanding price rise under very much sustained competition. The rain received was not great but it was sufficient for restockers to push the price of the best weaner steers up by between 15c and 25c/kg . The prices paid were right up to the best weaner prices seen for the season. The plainer bred cattle rose 5c to 6c/kg. The bulk of the yearling steers yarded  met a strong demand from restockers to sell at dearer rates also. Trade heifers were fully firm to a little dearer and the trade steers that might have gone to slaughter were all bought as feeder or restocker steers. That situation has been constant for the whole of the selling season.

The few pens of heavy steers and light bullocks sold at unchanged rates as did all cow descriptions. Buyers were looking for yield in the cows but the numbers of these cattle were minimal only. There was some restocker enquiry on cows but in most cases the slaughter price exceeded to restock rate."
" There was a bigger increase in the offering that was caused by the influx of weaner cattle at the start of the weaner selling season.   This should now continue for three months. There were a large number of very well bred and fattened vealers and weaners offered and their quality was well above anything so far offered this season. Just a few more trade heifers were available and bullocks were in greater numbers but the quality was reduced. There was fewer feeders steer or heifers yarded and those numbers are unlikely to increase in the near future. Cows were also less well supplied.

The usual buying field attended but the trend in the market, with only one exception, was cheaper. Heifer vealers suitable for the shop trade were dearer by 3c to 4c but all other weaners and vealers were cheaper by between 5c and 10c/kg. Feeder steers and heifers and trade heifers were all cheaper by 6c to 10c/kg with some orders not having been used. Restocker steer weaners met a lesser enquiry due to the drying conditions and recorded prices up to 10c/kg cheaper.

The few small lots of younger bullocks sold at firm rates but older cattle were cheaper. Export heifers met steady demand but all cows were cheaper by 4c to 5c/kg. Heavier feeder steers were cheaper under lowered competition and the bull price fell by 10c/kg.

A bullock, generously donated by a local grower for the Innisfail appeal, sold for $1166."
" The same numbers as last week, with very little change in quality. As with last weeks sale, over 500 weaner and vealer cattle were yarded, and again over 500 slaughter cows were offered. Values changed little  other than steer weaners, vealers, and cows, all of which managed a 2c rise. There was a slight weakening on the big numbers of heifer weaners and calves, but a good solid, unaltered market met all other descriptions.

The small increase in value on steer weaners, was occasioned by an extra order or two from Southern N.S.W., for these types.The numbers yarded have been over 1700 each week for the past five  weeks, the better and more prolonged season being the cause of the late sell-off."
" A feature of the market was the very sudden increase in the numbers of weaner cattle yarded. The increase is a sign of winter approaching coupled with the recent fall in values in most centres, and it also probably indicates a distrust of the seasonal conditions by growers. Weaners and vealers made up approximately 45% of the total offering. Quality and condition in the young cattle was good but there were very few trade weight yearlings yarded and cows and bullocks were again short supplied.

The usual regular orders were represented but the market trend across most cattle was cheaper. Heavy steer weaners were easier by 10c/kg while the lighter weights were not as badly affected. Heifer weaners and feeder heifers were cheaper in a range of 10c to 15c/kg. Yearling feeder steers were well down in quality and up to 10c/kg cheaper with the demand weakening except for a few selected top quality lots.

Demand for all heavier steers and bullocks fell away sharply with the lack of enquiry for plainer bred types being most obvious. All descriptions in steers were 7c to 8c/kg cheaper. Cows and heavy heifers were to 10c/kg cheaper but quality and the lack of yield played some part in the market price loss. Export feeder steers varied considerably in price but were generally cheaper. Bull values remained firm."
