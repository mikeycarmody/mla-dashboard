Commentary
"It was another  small field of Summer buyers that made it to the sale. Quality slipped with most cattle more suited to feedlots or restockers. The northern influence at the market waned and prices for secondary types was notably cheaper.  The market in general changed its temp with buyers from all sectors of the market subdued.  
 
It was a mixed selection of vealers on offer and restockers  and feedlots purchased all plainer types.  The pick of the vealers selling to processors, sold at 290c to 354c/kg. Vealers back to the paddock made from 240c to 360c/kg. Trade steers and heifers fetched 273c 315c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers sold to weak competition making from 280c to 338c/kg. There was good numbers of heifers to suit feedlots and they sold at 270c to 305c/kg.
 
In the export market  competition was weak. Heavy steers averaged 310c/kg with the pick purchased by lot feeders. Bullocks sold to a small field of buyers to average 325c/kg. A large offering of cows met a smaller field of buyers and prices slipping 10c to 15c/kg. Heavy cows traded between 274c to 296c with a single cow to 305c/kg. It was a notably weaker market for leaner grades under 520kg. D3 cows sold from 235c to 273c/kg.  Heavy bulls sold at varying prices, the bulk of heaviest types making from 278c to 305c/kg."
