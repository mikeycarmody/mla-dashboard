Commentary
"There was a slightly smaller yarding of 118 trade and export cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with 90 cows and bulls included.
The quality was mixed in the trade section and this was reflected in the prices. Yearling steers made 280c to 338c and heifers 298c to 306c. The few grown steers made 272c to 298c and heavy export heifers 278c to 300c.
There were 80 cows and all sold to strong competition with heavy pens making 250c to 288c, leaner 240c to 260c and very lean 220c to 245c. Heavy bulls made 200c to 224c/kg live.
