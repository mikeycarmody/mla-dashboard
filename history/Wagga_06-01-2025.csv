Commentary
"The first sale of the year opened with enthusiasm and strong market performance. Prices for secondary cattle surged across most weight categories, despite some buyers being absent from the sale. Quality was mostly secondary under 500kg and cattle that might of suited domestic buyers was out of reach for most processors due to the big uptick in price.
 
Feeder steers, witnessed an impressive jump of 62 cents for lighter weights, selling between 360c to 420c/kg. Medium weight steers also saw a positive trend, increasing by 40c to reach a selling prices of 340c to 417c. Feeder heifers also made significant gains, with lighter weights rising by 32c, selling from 302c to 360c/kg. Medium weight feeder heifers experienced a notable increase of 37c, with buyers paying between 304c to 367c/kg. In the trade cattle category 400 to 500kg, we had very few available, but the standout steers and heifers sold well, fetching between 330c to 394c/kg.
 
The heavier feeder steers, weighing 500 to 600kg saw prices lift as the sale progressed pushed along by several buyers wanting a market share. Prices surged by 29c, selling from 375 to 399c/kg. Heavy steers and bullocks destined for processing maintained their solid form, selling at 310 to 385c/kg. Additionally, heavy heifers with good shape attracted keen interest, lifting by 48c selling from 340c to 382c/kg. The cow market also showed positive momentum, gaining 7c to 9c with heavy cows priced between 290 to 306c/kg."
