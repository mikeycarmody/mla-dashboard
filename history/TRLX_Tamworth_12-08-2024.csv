Commentary
"The numbers reduced this week with young cattle and cows making up the bulk of the offering. The quality of the young cattle varied with some nice feeder cattle penned alongside a mixed penning of restocker cattle. A very good run of heavyweight cows. The condition of the offering also varied greatly with a number of well finished crop cattle in the offering. Most but not all restocker and feeder orders were in place while all regular processors operated.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with lightweight yearling steers to restockers selling to cheaper trends, the lightest most affected. Medium and heavy weight feeder steers saw little but breed and quality related change. There was an odd dearer sale in the heaviest of the feeders. Well finished heavy trade sold to a slightly cheaper trend. There was an odd dearer sale in the lightweight yearling heifers to restock. Trends through the medium and heavyweight feeders were firm to cheaper with breed and quality impacting price change. Well finished medium and heavyweight trade heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend.

Too few heavyweight grown steers to process to quote a trend. The well finished grown heifers sold to a cheaper trend however some of the change was age and breed related. Good quality grown heifers to feed saw a dearer trend with breed also contributing to some significant price change. A dearer cow market with demand high. The well finished heavyweights were as much as 7c/kg dearer along with an improvement in quality."
