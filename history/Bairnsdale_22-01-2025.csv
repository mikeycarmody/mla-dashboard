Commentary
"There were approximately 270 export and 80 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 180 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a cheaper market on some sales. Quality was good with some well finished grown and a limited selection of trade. Yearling heifers to the trade sold firm while a handful of vealers lacking finish sold to weaker demand. Grown steers and bullocks sold firm. Manufacturing steers eased 5c/kg. Heavy beef cows sold firm while light dairy lots eased 15c/kg. Heavy bulls sold firm. 

Vealers sold from 277c to 296c/kg. Yearling steers to restockers made between 306c and 330c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade sold between 320c and 326c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks made from 338c to 350c/kg. 

Manufacturing steers sold from 268c to 330c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made between 200c and 275c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly between 255c and 310c/kg. Heavy bulls made from 268c to 295c/kg.
