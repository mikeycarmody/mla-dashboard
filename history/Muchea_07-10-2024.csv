Commentary
"Numbers fell this week to just under 1000 head with a very mixed quality sale. Good runs of prime cows and grown steers and heifers were on offer while the majority of the sale were local and pastoral vealer and yearling calves presented in large lines. Both vealer steers and heifers eased 25/30c from last week and although yearling steers held firm yearling heifers were softer by 30/35c/kg. Shipping bulls were equal while slaughter bulls eased 20c and fat cows were also back 10c/kg.

Plain vealer steers ranged from 180c to 240c and with better condition or breeding from 250c up to 340c/kg. Plain vealer heifers proved difficult to sell starting from 70c to 200c and the best of them from 208c to 270c/kg.  Yearling steers weighing under 330kg sold from 200c to 280c and heavier steers from 198c to 362c depending on fat score. The lighter yearling heifers returned 104c to 272c and heavier heifers from 160c to 280c/kg.

Pastoral calves were mostly light weights weighing well under 250kg and presented in big lines with steers ranging from 132c to 240c and pastoral heifers sold in a wider range from 50c to 184c/kg.

Grown steers were down overall however the best of them still sold to 300c with a similar story for grown heifers returning 140c to 286c/kg. feeder cows were few and sold from 100c to 186c while most medium and heavy cows returned 180c to 220c with 2 cows selling at 246c for breeding.

Shipping bulls ranged from 140c to 244c while slaughter bulls eased 20c with only 1 pen of 12 selling over 200c to make 204c/kg.
