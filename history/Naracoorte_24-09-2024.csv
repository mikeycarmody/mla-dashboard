Commentary
"Numbers fell at Naracoorte today as agents yarded 757 head of liveweight and open auction cattle. These sold to the usual field of trade and processor buyers along with feeder interest. Quality improved this week with more weight and freshness over the pens in a mostly firm market in price. 
   A small number of mixed sex vealers came forward to sell from 370c to 400c/kg over both sexes. Yearling steers to the trade sold from mostly 340c to 362c as feeders operated from 266c to 390c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade ranged from 172c to 355c as feeders were active from 328c to 368c/kg. 
   Grown steers and bullocks attracted the trade from 372c to 387c with feeder support from 378c to 390c/kg. Grown heifers sold to the trade from 330c to 358c as feeders operated from 345c to 365c with manufacturing steers selling from 315c to 335c/kg. 
   Heavy cows sold from 310c to 330c, medium weights from 280c to 318c as lighter lots saw trade support from 270c and restocker interest to 300c/kg. Bulls saw a significant fall of 50c to 60c to sell from mostly 210c to 290c/kg.
