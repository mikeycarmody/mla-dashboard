Commentary
"There was a lot less competition in front of a slightly reduced penning. Both young cattle and grown cattle were evenly represented with a great variation in quality and condition. Differing from the previous sale was the lack of good quality straight lines. The regular processors were in attendance with the reduced attendance coming from the large field of feedlot and restockers present at the previous sale.

Trends were cheaper through all classes of young cattle with a fortnight of falling markets contributing to some large price changes.there was also quality related change. Crossbred yearling steers heading to Northern paddocks and feed yards held up reasonably well. In a falling market the secondary quality yearling heifers attracted some of the larger price corrections.

Despite all being in attendance processor demand was weaker through all classes of grown cattle with the well finished heavy steers down by 16c to 20c/kg. The well finished grown heifers were less affected. Cows and bulls felt the brunt of the cheaper market with the well finished heavy weights as much as 35c/kg cheaper while the plainer conditioned cows experienced greater falls. Heavy bulls were also significantly cheaper with falls in excess of those of the cows."
