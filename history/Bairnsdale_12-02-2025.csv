Commentary
"There were approximately 185 export and 40 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 60 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a dearer market. Quality was limited with cows making up most of the sale. A sprinkling of young steers and heifers sold dearer to restockers. A few pens of manufacturing steers lifted 5c to 10c/kg. Cows sold 3c to 10c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls gained 5c/kg. 

A few vealers with finish made 360c/kg. Young steers and heifers to restockers sold from 222c to 325c/kg. Manufacturing steers made between 272c and 334c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold between 175c and 235c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly from 242c to 298c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 275c to 314c/kg.
