Commentary
"The numbers increased with vealers and yearlings offloaded in large numbers while cows were also well represented. There was a limited supply of well finished export cattle. The quality of the offering was mostly good however mixed for breed. Condition varied greatly through all categories. There was not a lot of domestic trade competition while the regular export processors were in attendance as were the restocker and feeder orders.

Less demand saw the light weight steers sell to a cheaper trend. The medium and heavy weights to restock and feed experienced little but quality and breed related price change with market trends mostly firm. Light weight yearling heifers sold to a slightly cheaper trend. Medium and heavy weight feeder heifers also saw a slightly cheaper trend.

The well finished heavy grown steers and the older manufacturing steers experienced little change. Well finished grown heifers were as much as 10c/kg cheaper. There was a greater supply of medium weight cows than normal . Demand for all classes was weaker with the market trends as much as 17c/kg cheaper."
