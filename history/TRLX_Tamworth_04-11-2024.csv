Commentary
"The sell off leading into the warmer weather continued with an increased penning. Young cattle and cows were well represented while there were limited supplies of export cattle. The quality of the penning was fair to good with a lot of the offering presenting in forward condition. The full field of regular buyers were in attendance with some having extra orders. 

Through the young cattle the plain and secondary quality lots struggled to maintain recent pricing levels while the better quality lots had little trouble.  Light weight yearling steers to restockers were keenly sought with the market showing dearer trends. There were some strong breed related increases. The medium weights sold on a firm to slightly dearer trend while the heavy weight feeders saw little but quality related price change. Well finished heavy weights to the trade sold on a slightly cheaper trend with feedlotters not pushing quite as hard. Trends through the yearling heifers were mostly cheaper with large numbers carrying forward to fat condition. This created some issues for those going into feed pens, particularly in the light and medium weight classes, not so much on the heavy weights. Trade heifers also sold to cheaper trends.

The limited supply of heavy grown steers to process sold to cheaper trends with age a factor in some cases. The best of the grown heifers saw a firm to slightly cheaper trend. There was a small improvement in the heavy weight cow market with increased competition between the usual processors.  The medium weight cows followed a similar trend. There was little change in trends through the heavy bull market."
