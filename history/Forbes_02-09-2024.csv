Commentary
"Numbers lifted by 1172 for a yarding of 1945 cattle. Quality was mixed with good supplies of heavy prime cattle and feeder weights on offer. There was also a large yarding of prime cows. All the regular buyers were present. 

Prime yearling steers were 8c dearer, 274c to 385c while prime yearling heifers sold cheaper, 270c to 372c/kg. Feeder steers lifted 5c, 340c to 420c and feeder heifers dropped 20c, 260c to 340c/kg.

Prime grown steers were down 12c, 260c to 383c, and prime grown heifers gained 10c, 250c to 370c/kg. Cows were 10c stronger, 2 and 3 scores sold from 210c to 315, and heavy prime cows, 305c to 340c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 305c/kg.
