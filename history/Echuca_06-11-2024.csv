Commentary
"Numbers remained high with another 1850 cattle filling the yards to near capacity. There was some stand-out trade steers and heifers of a higher standard than a fortnight ago, while the export run included the usual mix of cows, manufacturing and grown steers. Demand from domestic processors was more energetic, and helped by some outstanding quality, prices averaged dearer after reaching a top of 411c/kg. The main grades of heavy beef cows sold at modestly dearer levels by 3-10c/kg. But there was still some dull spots in the sale, with grown steers, grown heifers and any secondary bred or shaped cattle averaging cheaper compared to the last market at Echuca on October 23.

Competition was keener on good trade cattle, with the lead run mostly in the range of 350c to 380c/kg but with some exceptional Limousin steers and heifers offering high carcass yields pushing above 390c to a top of 411c/kg. The best run of yearling steers in the 400-480kg weight range averaged 365c/kg. Buyers did tend to be weight sensitive and bidding wasnâ€™t as strong on cattle weighing over 520kg. Well bred yearlings and vealers with not quite as much carcass potential or finish from 310c to 345c/kg, with restockers and feeders operating in this price band. Young cattle which sold under 300c/kg tended to be lighter or lack breed quality at 240c to 290c/kg.

The best heavy grown steers were similar to 9c/kg off on some of the bigger types at 320c to 355.6c/kg.  Grown heifers performed around quality at 260 to 320c/kg for most - but noting buyers were selective on plainer shaped grassy types or young females showing signs of being in calf which were discounted down to 240c/kg. 

The cow marked showed consistency at 270c to 290c/kg for most of the lead beef pens, with just occasional sales higher to 306c/kg.  Leaner beef cows 240c to 280c/kg; plainest cows down to 168.6c.
