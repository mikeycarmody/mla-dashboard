"A total of 4,100 head were yarded for the Blackall prime and store sale this week. The yarding was dominated by prime cattle with 700 prime steers and 1300 cows penned. Despite the increase in yardings of across the state, three additional export processors were operating which helped to lift prices for prime cattle by 5-10c/kg.

Medium weight steers 330 to 400kg to feed sold to 358.2c to average 353c and those returning to the paddock topped at 352c/kg.
Prices for heavy weight yearling steers slipped slightly, mainly to an increase in Bos Indicus influence, selling to 368.2c to average 354c/kg.

Light weight restocker heifers 200 to 280kg saw increase support from central and southern Queensland and improved by 20c/kg selling to 330.2c to average 281c/kg.
Medium weight heifers 330 to 400kg to feed made to 298.2c and averaged 264c while heavy feeder heifers sold to 293.2c and averaged 285c/kg.
