Commentary
"The number of stock at Dalby reduced by more than half the previous weeks level to 3,495 head. All the regular export processors were in attendance however one major exporter was not operating. Feeder representation was good and all were active in the market plus a good lineup of restocker buyers.

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock sold to a market close to the previous weeks levels with only quality related adjustments. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed followed a similar trend. Light weight yearling heifers to restockers sold to a cheaper market. Yearling heifers to feed experienced some quality related price changes. A small selection of heavy grown steers and bullocks were noticeably cheaper.  Cows continued to lose ground in price to average 10c to 15c/kg less. 

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock averaged from 410c to 418c with sales to 456c/kg. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market averaged from 395c to 405c with sales to 424c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed made to a top of 396c to average 374c/kg.  Light weight yearling heifers returning to the paddock made to the occasional 348c to average 273c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed averaged from 328c to 334c with sales to 354c/kg.  Heavy weight yearling heifers to feed averaged 312c with sales to 334c/kg.

A relatively small selection of heavy grown steers and bullocks to export processors averaged from 303c to 305c and sold to 310c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows averaged 235c and made to 243c/kg. Heavy weight 3 score cows averaged 268c and the best of the heavy weight cows averaged 279c and made to 284c/kg. Heavy weight bulls were noticeably cheaper and made to 268c/kg.
