Commentary
"There was a smaller yarding of 195 trade and export cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with fewer good quality yearlings. Most yearlings met an easier market with steers making 172c to 220c and heifers 196c to 236c/kg.
The best grown steers and bullocks made 180c to 240c. The best heavy cows averaged 15c cheaper making 160c to 180c while leaner made 130c to 148c and very lean 56c to 140c/kg.
Heavy bulls made 130c to 140c/kg liveweight.
