Commentary
"Numbers were similar with two thirds of the offering cows. It was a  big field of export and domestic buyers that made it to the sale. Quality was secondary with only odd pens of well finished yearlings. The market was stronger with Northern restockers and feedlots looking to secure all well-bred stock. Export cattle were the highlight with cows the standout of the sale.
 
Trade steers and heifers were in limited numbers selling from 334c 410c/kg.  Vealers to suit processors were few making from 385c to 395c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers sold to stronger demand. The bulk of the medium weights making from 376c to 390c/kg. The heifer portion was keenly contested by a northern feedlot which resulted in a dearer trend of 25c/kg. Feed heifers 330 to 400kg made from 323c to 350c/kg.
 
In the export market  competition lifted over all categories due to the limited number. Heavy steers averaged 396c/kg. Bullocks sold to a big group of buyers creating plenty of competition.  Prices improved 2c to average 395c/kg. A mixed quality offering of cows, met a large field of buyers.  Cow prices surged 44c to 53c/kg, with buyers all vying for a market share. Heavy cows traded between 336c to 364c/kg, while the D2 and D3 cows under 520kg made from 260c to 333c/kg. Heavy bulls sold at varying prices, the bulk of heaviest types making from 302c to 325c/kg."
