Commentary
"   Numbers dropped this week as agents yarded 921 head of liveweight and open auction cattle. These sold to the usual field of trade and processor buyers along with feeder and restocker interest. Quality was mixed from prime lots down to store pens in a market that ranged from firm to easier in places. 
   Yearling steers to trade buyers sold to 374c amongst strong feeder activity who took most of those on offer from 314c to 400c/kg. Yearling heifers saw trade support from mostly 325c to 410c with one isolated sale at 430c/kg. Feeders operated here from 240c to 360c with restocker activity over both sexes from 325c to 380c/kg. 
   Grown steers and bullocks sold from 320c to 388c to the trade with feeder support from 357c to 395c/kg. Grown heifers returned from 310c to 398c to the trade with feeder activity from 355c to 378c as restockers purchased from 278c to 344c with manufacturing steers reaching 310c/kg. 
   Heavy cows were 10c to 20c easier in price as they ranged from 290c to 335c as the trade sourced lighter pens from 230c to 294c with some restockers operating from 258c to 283c/kg. Bulls sold from 250c to 312c/kg.
