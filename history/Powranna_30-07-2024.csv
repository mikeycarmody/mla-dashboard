Commentary
"There was a very small number of 43 cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with quality very mixed. Most cattle met a stronger market with the best yearlings making 270c to 292c with leaner heifers 220c to 260c.
The few grown steers made 240c to 288c with quality very average.
The few cows sold to a much better market with heavy beef cows making 240c to 244c, medium 236c to 260c and light D1 cows 138c to 176c/kg liveweight.
