Commentary
"The onset of warmer weather and heading into some very hot dry days saw the numbers increase significantly. Young cattle were plentiful and there were some high quality heavy weight cows penned. Overall the quality and condition of the offering was good, there were some plainer quality cattle penned also. The usual orders were in place while there was a greater QLD presence in the feeder steer market.

Restocker demand for light weight steers was strong with this category one of very few showing in the positive. A greater selection of medium and heavy weight yearling steers eased requirement pressure and resulted in cheaper trends. The heavy weights were least affected losing around 10c/kg. Heavy trade steers were quite a bit cheaper. As is often the case on a falling market the heifers saw significantly cheaper trends through the light and medium weights while the good quality heavy weights were less affected. The plain and secondary quality heifers showing the greater falls. There were signs through the young cattle market that supply lines were filling.

Export cattle sold to cheaper trends with both heavy grown steers and heiferâ€™s adversely affected. There was some quality related price improvement on an otherwise cheaper trend through the cow market. Heavy bulls were plentiful and sold to cheaper trends with some of the heavier bulls carrying an excess of condition."
