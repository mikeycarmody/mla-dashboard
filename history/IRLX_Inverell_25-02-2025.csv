Commentary
"Numbers were well up this week for a yarding of 1980 head.  Included in the yarding was a larger offering of cows, while feeder and background cattle were also well supplied.  

Quality of the yearling cattle was good with mainly well finished and well bred steers and heifers through the sale.  Competition was strong for all classes of young cattle with feeder and background buyers keen to acquire numbers.

Restocker weaner steers sold to a top of 416c, while medium weight feeder steers sold from 320c to 398c and heavy feeder steers ranged from 334c to 375c/kg.  Yearling heifers to feed and background met a solid market selling from 280c to 336c/kg.

Grown steers were in limited supply to be slightly dearer selling from 316c to 356c/kg to process.  There was several drafts of heavy well finished grown heifers that reached a top price of 334c/kg.  

There was plenty of weight in the large penning of cows that sold 8c to 10c dearer, with 3 scores ranging from 265c to 280c, while heavy cows sold from 280c to a top price of 318c/kg.  Heavy bulls sold to 312c/kg.
