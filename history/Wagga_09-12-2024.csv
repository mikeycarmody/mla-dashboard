Commentary
"There was a significant surge in numbers, as producers rush to capitalize on higher price levels before the approaching Christmas break. The sale was robust, with most buyers in attendance, including a big contingent of restockers and lot feeders eager to secure cattle. The northern regions have experienced one of their best starts to the summer cropping season, which has invigorated restockers, enabling them to expand their purchasing range. Notably, restockers have increased their weight range, now focusing on cattle weighing between 400 to 500kg. This shift reflects a strong demand for stock as producers look to replenish their numbers, with restockers playing a pivotal role in driving prices upwards.
 
In the steer market, restockers dominated sales for steers under 400kg, with prices jumping an impressive 21c to 23c/kg. Steers destined for the paddock in the 330-400kg weight range averaged $1,401/head, while feeder steers in the same category averaged $1,411, with top feeder prices reaching 392c/kg.  Medium-weight feeder steers also saw gains, with an increase of 14c bringing their average to 359c/kg. Restockers in the same weight categories were active, paying between 336c to 363c/kg, effectively filling any price gaps left by feedlots. Medium weight feeder heifer saw an uptick of 15c averaging 323c/kg. Trade steers and heifers also experienced solid demand, selling between 302c and 348c/kg. reflecting how difficult it was for domestic processors to outbid restockers and lot feeders.
 
On the export front, a Queensland processor exerted pressure on other export companies, resulting in an uptick of 15c to 26c/kg. Prices for heavy steers and bullocks ranged from 300c to 368c/kg, indicating a competitive market for well finished steers. Heavy cows were also in high demand, gaining 8c to 10c, with prices ranging between 280c and 308c/kg. However, leaner grades faced wide-ranging pressure, from processors and restockers alike resulting in prices bouncing 11c to average 280c/kg."
