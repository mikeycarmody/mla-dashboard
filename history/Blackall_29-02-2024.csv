Commentary
"Blackall combined agents yarded approximately 4,800 head for the monthly special weaner and store for February. Overall quality was very good with large runs of local vendor bred yearling steers and heifers on offer, that were met with strong competition mostly from local and southern restockers, and feedlots from the western downs.
Light weight restocker ‘c’ muscle steers saw prices to 460.2c to average 423c while those steers 280 to 330kg met solid demand selling to 450.2c to average 414c/kg.
Restockers paid up to 432.2c for steers 330 to 400kg averaging 379c while those to feed averaged 339c/kg. Heavy feeders steers over 400kg remained strong with sales to an isolated 386.2c to average 351c/kg.
Light weight restocker heifers sold to 300.2c to average 258c and heifers over 400kg to feed made to 306.2c averaging 292c/kg. 
Best of the cows and calves made to $1775/unit.
