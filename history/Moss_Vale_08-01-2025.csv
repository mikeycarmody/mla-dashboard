Commentary
"The market was very strong for the first sale of 2025, where there were 728 mostly good quality cattle. There were some good runs of prime vealers reaching 456c/kg, along with some good lines of young cattle suiting the restockers. Feeder steers were well supplied and there were some outstanding pens of high yielding heavy cows to process.

Yearlings to suit the trade made from 280c to 448c/kg. Feeder steers were up to 40c dearer, selling from 320c to 410c/kg.. Yearling heifers to feed were also considerably dearer, reaching 348c and 356c/kg to the paddock. Weaner steers sold from 344c to 438c and the heifer portion topped at 378c/kg.

Heavy grown steers made from 300c to 340c and grown heifers reached 330c/kg. Cows were 15c better, with the 3 scores ranging from 255c to 290c, and heavy 4 scores sold from 294c to 312c/kg. A  heavy bull to process made 310c/kg or over $3600.
