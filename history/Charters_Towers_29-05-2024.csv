Commentary
"Numbers fell by 744 for a yarding of 3162 cattle. Quality was very good for the majority on offer comprising of large lines of well finished cows along with some high quality crossbred store lines. All processes were in attendance and operating, supported by regular feeders, one live exporter, central and western restockers. Cattle Were drawn from Mt Isa, Burketown, Normanton, Einasleigh, Hughenden, local and coastal areas.

Processor demand was firm throughout and good quality store lines were well supported, however lightweight and lesser quality lines attracted minimal support and were difficult to sell. Grown steers and bullocks lift7-20c, medium weight cows averaged firm to 5c higher and heavy bulls eased 18-25c/kg.

A large sample of young weaned crossbred steers above 200kg to backgrounders averaged 327c, selling to 356c, Brahman steers averaged 252c/kg. Good quality cross bred heifers returning to the paddock reached 220c/kg.. Light yearling steers to restockers sold to 260c to average 253c and steers above 330kg to grass averaged 258c/kg. Yearling steers from 280kg to 380kg to live export averaged 210c to 228c/kg. Yearling heifers above 200kg to restockers made to 198c to average 178c, heifers above 280 kg returning to the paddock averaged 213c and heifers to feed sold to 210c to average 201c/kg. Heifers above 330kg to the trade sold to 224c to average 193c to 215c/kg.

Fewer numbers of grown steers above 400kg to the trade reached 260c to average 236c/kg. Best quality grown heifers made to 220c to average 204c/kg. A small sample of young bullocks to processors sold to 242c, most selling from 210c to 230c/kg. Fewer numbers of grown cows met solid demand. Medium weight 3 score cows sold to 204c to average from 185c to 189c, prime heavyweight 4 score cows topped at 219c to average 215c/kg. Heavy bulls to processors sold to 222c to average 170c/kg.

A small number of cows and calves sold from $900 to $950/unit.
