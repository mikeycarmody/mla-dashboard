Commentary
"There were approximately 90 export and 15 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 100 head week-on-week. Most of the usual buying group was present and operating in a firm market. Quality was plain with little finish and no prime cattle penned. The young cattle sold mostly to local restockers. The grown cattle sold mostly to local restockers. The limited selection of cows sold firm. Heavy bulls eased a few cents. 

A couple of finished vealers made 380c and 385c/kg. Yearling steers to restockers sold from 291c to 350c/kg. Grown steers to restockers made between 320c and 341c/kg. Light and medium weight cows sold between 220c and 312c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly from 292c to 335c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 283c to 332c/kg.
