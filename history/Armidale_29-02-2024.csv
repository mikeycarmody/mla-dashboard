Commentary
"A further reduction in numbers. Vealers and light weight yearlings were well supplied along with some very good cows. Overall the quality of the offering was good albeit mixed for breed. Condition was fair to good with all buyers able to operate.

There was strong breed specific demand from local restockers which resulted in steers under 330kg selling to dearer trends and posting strong gains. There was also some breed related improvement in the heifer weaners. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold on a dearer market than a fortnight ago whilst showing some quality related price change in places. Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend.

Well finished heavy grown steers to process sold to a slightly cheaper trend with some weight and quality related price change. The best of the heavy weight grown heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend. There was strong demand for cows with restockers active on those lighter in condition. Well finished heavy weights attracted strong processor competition with trends as much as 15c/kg dearer than a fortnight ago. Heavy bulls sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend."
