Commentary
"Tamworth penned 1547 mixed quality cattle which was 700 less than last week. There were drafts of better quality pens in the yearling steer and heifer drafts and these sold to dearer trends for the most part. Weaners and plainer yearlings were harder to sell. Heavy cows to process were dearer with not all operators competing. There was a major feeder operator absent.

Steer weaners were considerably cheaper and this followed onto the heifers which slipped 18c/kg. Most weaners were purchased by restockers. Light yearling steers to background were significantly dearer to top at 422/kg. Similar weights to feed on resulted in a loss of 16c/kg. Medium feeders saw a modest rise 270c to 402c/kg. Heavy feeders also dearer. 

Plainer quality light yearling heifers sold to cheaper trends and were purchased by backgrounder interests. There were quite a few lapses in quality through these drafts. With a lift in quality of the medium weight feeder heifers they followed the steer portion to a modest rise and prices ranged 202c to 341c/kg. Heavy feeder heifers also dearer.

Heavy grown heifers showed a rise in places of up to 12c/kg. Medium weight cows managed a solid rise. The heavy cows increased their trends with a 9c to 12c/kg improvement and sold up to 231c/kg.
