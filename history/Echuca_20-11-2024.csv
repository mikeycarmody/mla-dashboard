Commentary
"Another near capacity yarding of 1882 cattle as conditions remain dry in the region. Quality was plainer overall, although there was still some very good steers and heifers off grain presented. The buying group was smaller and subdued, and price falls of 10 to 30c/kg - and sometimes more in places - were recorded for all categories. As a general rule the better bred and finished cattle held their value the best, and it was plainer grassy heifers and off-bred steers and heifers that wore the brunt of the cheaper trend. However the lack of buying depth meant there was still some reasonable cattle which got caught up in the discounting and sold at much cheaper levels to a fortnight ago.

Domestic processors paid from 330c to a top of 375c/kg for the lead of the fed yearlings or vealers showing shape , muscle and carcass yield potential. A couple of feeder and restocking orders still supported decent lines of Angus steers at up to 352c/kg. But underneath this was a lot of young steers and heifers which sold in a range of 280c to 320c/kg, with plainer shaped heifers or off-bred cattle quickly pulled back to between 220c to 260c/kg. Bidding occasionally dipping below 200c on crossbreds.

In the export run the lead of the heavy grown steers sold from 302c to 340.6c/kg, with some of the plainer shaped beef types down to 280c/kg. Grown heifers sold on quality and were subject to discounting to show a spread of 230c to 310c/kg, with just a few better quality types to 330c/kg.  There wasnâ€™t as many manufacturing or dairy steers in this yarding and they ranged from 220c to 300c/kg.

The heavier beef cows lost 10c to 20c/kg, while lighter and plainer conditioned types including dairy females lost more in value. Main run of handy beef cows 240c to 275c/kg, plainer types 210c to 240c/kg. The most secondary dairy down to 156c/kg.
