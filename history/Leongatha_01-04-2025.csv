Commentary
"There were approximately 2470 export and 400 young cattle penned representing an increase of 80 head week-on-week. All of the regular export and domestic orders were active and competing in a dearer market. Quality was mixed with plenty of manufacturing steers in the grown and more finish in the trade cattle. Most trade cattle sold 10c to 30c/kg dearer with some isolated sales even higher. Grown steers and bullocks gained 10c to 20c/kg. Heavy Grown heifers showing good finish improved 20c/kg. Manufacturing steers lifted 20c to 30c/kg. Cows kicked 20c to 30c and up to 45c/kg in places. Heavy bulls gained 5c/kg. 

Vealers sold from 340c to 434c/kg. Yearling trade steers made between 350c and 401c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade sold between 348c and 398c after a top of 430c/kg. Grown steers made from 374c to 420c/kg. Bullocks sold from 385c to 425c/kg. Heavy grown heifers made between 355c and 392c/kg. 

Heavy Friesian manufacturing steers sold between 285c and 377c with the crossbred portion between 345c and 408c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made from 246c to 314c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly from 282c to 360c/kg. Heavy bulls made between 310c and 365c/kg.
