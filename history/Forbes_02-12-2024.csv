Commentary
"Numbers dropped by 453 for a yarding of 975 cattle. Quality was mixed with feeder weights the best supplied. There were limited numbers of heavy prime cattle and cows on offer. All the regular buyers were present, and the market sold dearer.

Young cattle to the trade were 5c to 10c dearer, prime yearling steers sold from 328c to 348c, and prime yearling heifers, 243c to 330c/kg. Feeder steers were 15c to 20c stronger, 270c to 389c, while feeder heifers were up to 30c better, 260c to 340c/kg.

Prime grown cattle were firm to 5c dearer, heavy steers sold from 290c to 340c, and heavy heifers, 300c to 323c/kg. Cows were up 6c, 2 and 3 scores sold from 180c to 279c, and heavy prime cows, 272c to 282c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 290c/kg.
