Commentary
"There were approximately 700 export and 50 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 40 head from the sale of a fortnight ago. Most of the usual buyers were present and operating in a dearer market. Quality was good in places, although limited, with cows representing more than half of the sale. Trade cattle were in short supply. Grown cattle improved from 35c to 55c/kg. Cows lifted 20c to 35c/kg. Heavy bulls gained 17c/kg. 

A handful of young steers and heifers sold to restockers from 200c to 260c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks made between 260c and 310c/kg. Heavy grown heifers showing good finish sold between 275c and 310c/kg. 

Heavy Friesian manufacturing steers made from 210c to 250c with the crossbred portion from 227c to 258c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 110c to 232c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 180c and 275c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 224c and 256c/kg.
