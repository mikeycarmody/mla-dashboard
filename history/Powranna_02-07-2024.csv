Commentary
"There was a small yarding of 56 cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with quality very mixed and difficult to get a reliable quote throughout the sale. The best yearling steers made 192c to 230 and plainer 100c to 198c. Yearling heifers made 200c to 240c/kg.

There was a very small number of cows and the best heavy pens made 182c to 188c, leaner 150c to 170c and very light 10c to 80c/kg.

Market Reporter Richard Bailey"
