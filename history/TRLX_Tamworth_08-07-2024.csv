Commentary
"Tamworth offered 1948 mixed cattle which included an increase in the cow penning. The usual buyers attended plus an extra cow buyer. This resulted in much dearer trends for the cow product. Apart from the odd sale of plainer cattle being cheaper the trends for most other categories sold to a dearer market for feeders and backgrounders alike.

Sales for weaner steers were much dearer restockers paying up to 400c/kg with similar interest for the heifer drafts 273c to 314c/kg. Sales for light yearling feeder steers were considerably dearer however light background categories lost ground to be much cheaper selling to 262c/kg. A large portion of the medium weight steers gained 8c/kg while a similar number of backgrounders slipped substantially 320c to 360c/kg. Heavy yearling steers to feed on sold to 20c/kg dearer while processors pushed heavy steers to 366c/kg. Light background heifers were significantly dearer and the medium weights to feed improved 8c/kg. A draft of PTIC heifers sold 286c to 320c/kg.

Heavy grown steers were much dearer as were the heifers up 8c/kg ranging 263c to 310c/kg. The cow market very strong with medium cows 170c to 239c/kg. The heavy cows over 40c/kg dearer in places 249c to 280c/kg. The best bulls also dearer up to 23c/kg.
