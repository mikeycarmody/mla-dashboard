Commentary
"Isolated falls of rain across parts of the supply area reduced the number of cattle at Warwick by 182 head to 1,083. Larger numbers of good heavy weight cows were included in the lineup this week along with a good sample of heavy grown steers and bullocks plus a good lineup of feeder and light weight cattle. Buyer attendance was good and all were active across all classes.

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock averaged over 20c/kg better and more in places. Yearling steers to feed lifted in price by 3c to 5c/kg. Heavy grown steers and bullocks averaged 5c to 10 c/kg dearer. All classes of cows sold to a dearer trend of 12c to 18c/kg however some of this improvement was attributed to the lift in quality.

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock averaged 405c and made to 440c/kg. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market made to 394c to average 368c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed made to 363c to average 357c with some to the wholesale meat trade at 394c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers returning to the paddock made to 328c to average 284c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed made to 385c to average 310c/kg. A pen of very good heavy weight yearling heifers to the local trade made to 422c/kg.

Heavy grown steers to export processors made to 359 to average 355c and the bullock portion made to 357c to average 350c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows averaged 259 and made to 267c/kg. Heavy weight 3 score cows averaged 280c and the best of the heavy weight cows averaged 297c and made to 305c/kg.  Heavy weight bulls made to 322c/kg.
