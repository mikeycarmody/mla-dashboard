Commentary
"There were approximately 250 export and 50 young cattle penned representing an increase of 20 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present but not all operating in a generally firm market. Quality was limited with secondary cattle throughout and cows representing more than half of the sale. The young cattle lacked finish and sold mostly to restockers. The grown lots were mostly secondary crossbreds. Heavy cows eased a few cents while light weights improved 5c/kg. 

Young steers and heifers to restockers sold from 250c to 314c/kg. A couple of grown steers sold from 330c to 342c/kg. Manufacturing steers made between 270c and 298c/kg. Grown heifers sold between 300c and 322c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made from 204c to 270c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly from 240c to 294c/kg. Heavy bulls were in short supply reaching 336c/kg. 

Market reporter: Brendan Fletcher."
