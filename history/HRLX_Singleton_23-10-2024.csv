Commentary
"With wet weather abating Singleton agents yarded 785 improved quality cattle, nearly doubling last weeks yarding. Cow numbers improved to yard around 90 with weight in the weaner and yearling cattle on the improve each week. With numbers and improved quality, buyer demand was aggressive as most cattle leave the district hence truck space able to be filled with greater confidence. Not all of the regular buyers attended although opportune local re-stockers helped fill the void. Most grades were selling to dearer trends.
 
Light weaner steers improved by 9c/kg selling from 274c to 440c/kg, medium weights much dearer trading from 270c to 438c/kg and over 330kg cheaper making from 304c to 414c/kg. Weaner heifers up to 38c/kg dearer selling from 260c to 318c/kg with the local trade paying up to 320c/kg. Over 330kg also saw positive trends making from 248c to 306c/kg.
 
Yearling steers over 400kg to feed up by 8c/kg averaging 366c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers also to feed up by 17c/kg selling from 270c to 300c/kg.
 
2 score cows lost no admirers and were well supported on the back of much improved quality making from 140c to 260c/kg whilst the heavy 3 and 4 scores were firm to a shade dearer selling from 240c to 275c/kg. The best heavy Bull topped at 270c/kg.
