Commentary
"With a very good rain event over the weekend all but ensuring producers a bumper spring the numbers were down slightly. The female categories dominated supply making a a large percentage of the offering. Quality and condition were quite mixed throughout. The usual buyers were in attendance with demand for well presented good quality cattle remaining high.

Varying trends through the young cattle where lightweight steers to restockers saw a mostly dearer trend with some quality related change. The medium and heavy weight yearling steers to feed sold to cheaper trends with averages down as a result of breed and quality related change. Well finished heavy trade steers were slightly dearer.lightweight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold on a firm to slightly cheaper market trend. The lack of suitable steers in the medium and heavy weight categories contributed to dearer trends for similar weight yearling heifers with the market trend 8c to 18c/kg dearer.

There were too few well finished heavy grown steers to quote while the well finished grown heifers attracted strong processor competition to show dearer trends. There were premiums for those with 4 teeth and less. Medium weight cows to process sold to a cheaper trend while those to restockers were dearer under increased competition. Well finished high yielding heavy weight cows once again attracted the strongest competition from processors with the market showing a dearer trend of as much as 9c/kg."
