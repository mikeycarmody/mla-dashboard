Commentary
"There was a small reduction in numbers. The quality and condition of the offering was generally good with quite a few showing the benefit of crop. Cows were again well supplied and there was a greater than normal representation of grown heifers. Cattle suitable to processors were well supplied with not as many for feedlotters and restockers. The full filed of buyers were in attendance. 

The mixed quality nature of the few weaner steers suitable to restockers impacted price change in the negative. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed recovered all of last weeks losses and some to show strong gains. The heifer portion to restocker and feed sold to a slightly dearer trend. The demand for well finished cattle from processors was reflected in the market with those going to the trade showing significant improvement.

Well finished heavy weight grown steers with 2 or more teeth were keenly sought by both export and domestic processors to also show significant improvement. Well finished grown heifers sold to dearer trends with odd sales as much as 20c/kg dearer. The cow market continued its upward trajectory and showed no sign of slowing with medium weight cows showing some of the strongest improvement. The well finished heavy weight cows saw a dearer trend with prices as a much as 26c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls were also in strong demand."
