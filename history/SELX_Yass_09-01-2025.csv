Commentary
"Only a small offering of mixed quality cattle were penned for the first sale of the year. There were only a handful of weaners and plenty of yearlings with most going to feeder orders. There was only a small penning of grown steers and heifers and around 65 cows. Despite the plainer quality through the yarding, demand was strong and prices lifted between 20c and 30c/kg on most cattle.
 
The few weaner steers sold to 381c and heifers 295c/kg. Medium weight feeder steers ranged from 310c to 360c and heavy weights reached 386c/kg returning around $1800/head. Medium weight feeder heifers ranged from 320c to 339 and heavy weights 312c to 340c/kg.
 
Grown steers and bullock to process ranged between 355c and 375c and 2 tooth grown heifers weighing 560kg topped at 365c/kg. Heavy 3 and 4 score cows sold from 285c to 312c and the medium weight 2 scores 269c to 275c/kg. the best of the heavy bulls reached 311c/kg."
