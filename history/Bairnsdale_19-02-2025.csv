Commentary
"There were approximately 250 export and 50 young cattle penned representing an increase of 70 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a dearer market. Quality improved with a few more prime cattle and a smaller proportion of cows. Young cattle sold up to 40c/kg dearer with stronger competition from processors for lots with finish and more demand from locals for secondary lines. Grown cattle lifted 20c to 35c/kg. Cows sold 30c to 40c/kg dearer. Heavy bulls gained 5c to 15c/kg. 

A couple of vealers sold from 296c to 344c/kg. Yearling trade steers made between 340c and 363c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade sold between 320c and 333c with a few pens to local restockers between 312c and 348c/kg. Manufacturing steers made from 285c to 360c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 240c to 270c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 260c and 332c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 280c and 330c/kg.
