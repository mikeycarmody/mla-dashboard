Commentary
"This sale was scheduled in the off week to avoid clashing with Easter. There was a greatly reduced supply with quality and condition very mixed. All categories were represented however there were not many straight lines. There was a reduced buying presence with the lack of numbers contributing to that.

There were not many positive market trends through the young cattle where quality was a factor. A small number of weaner steers to restockers remained firm while the heifer portion were cheaper. Yearling steers to restock and feed were considerably cheaper with quality the lack of supply and restricted competition factors. The market trend for yearling heifers took the greatest hit with prices for all those going to restock and feed significantly cheaper.

Heavy grown steers sold to cheaper trends. A small number of well finished grown heifers sold to a slightly dearer trend. There was little change in the cow market when taking quality into account."
