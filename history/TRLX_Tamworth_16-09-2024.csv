Commentary
"Numbers were down in a yarding where female cattle once again dominated supply. The quality of the offering was generally good however there were still some secondary quality cattle penned. The condition varied from fair to very good. All the regular buyers were in attendance.

Straight lines of well bred young cattle garnered more support than the mixed breed pens while the plainer quality lots struggled to gain much support. Light weight yearling steers to restockers sold to dearer trends with the lighter end of the classes showing the greatest improvement. Medium weights to restockers also sold to a dearer trend while those to feed suffered from a reduction in average quality. Heavy weight feeder steers saw little but quality related price change. Yearlings heifers up to 280 kg to restockers sold to a dearer trend. The heavier weight classes saw demand weaken with market trends generally much cheaper.

An improved quality penning of heavy grown steers suitable to processors sold to a dearer trend, the price change boosted by that quality improvement.
Well finished grown heifers to process saw a firm to slightly dearer trend while those to feed also saw improvement.  The cow market experienced dearer trend with the increase only moderate. Light weight bulls were significantly cheaper with quality a factor while the heavy weight meat works bulls sold on a firm to slightly dearer market trend."
