Commentary
"Singleton agents opened the new year with 655 cattle with the majority being Weaners amongst a big crowd of onlookers and most of the regular buyers at the rail. With gentle rain throughout the sale market trends were of a general firm to dearer sentiment however mixed quality amongst some grades saw averages somewhat effected.
 
Re-stocker steer weaners held generally firm selling from 330c to 450c/kg with local butchers and lot feeders competing strongly on those with shape and cover over 330kg making from 320c to 388c/kg to be 20c/kg dearer. Re-stocker heifer weaners saw lighter weights slightly cheaper with medium and heavy weights 10c to 18c/kg better off trading between 296c and 335c/kg and to the local trade making up to 354c/kg to be 15c/kg dearer.
 
Yearling feeder steers saw mixed results with medium weights up by 11c/kg selling from 340c to 386c/kg whilst heavier types over 400kg were back 7c/kg trading between 330c and 360c/kg.
 
Heavy grown steers and heifers saw spirited competition on the few that were there making from 298c to 344c/kg. Around 50 cows were offered light 2 score types 17c/kg dearer making from 220c to 280c/kg, heavy prime 3 and 4 score cows were 13c/kg better selling from 295c to a top of 302c/kg.
