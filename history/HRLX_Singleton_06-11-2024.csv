Commentary
"A 30% reduction in numbers saw Singleton agents yard 550 cattle, young cattle were of good quality older cattle very mixed. Not all of the regular processors were in play whilst re-stocker orders didnâ€™t have the enthusiasm of last week with bidding often slow and drawn out.
 
Light and medium weight steer weaners made from 262c to 436c/kg to be anywhere from 10c to 50c/kg easier, heavier types over 330kg 24c/kg cheaper trading from 286c to 340c/kg with high yielding B muscle calves making up to 342c/kg to the trade to be 10c/kg dearer. Light weaner heifers showed cheapening trends selling from 246c to 300c/kg, medium weights up by 4c/kg making from 278c to 288c/kg, similar dearer trend for B muscle trade over 330kg making from 308c to 328c/kg.
 
Yearling steers medium and heavy weights softening by 5c to 9c/kg and selling from 300c to 344c/kg. The few heavy export steers and heifers making from 254c to 316c/kg, the handful of heavy cows firm to slightly easier trading between 270c and 286c/kg.
