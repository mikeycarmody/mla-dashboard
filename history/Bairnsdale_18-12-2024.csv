Commentary
"There were 100 export and 17 young cattle penned representing a decrease of 245 head week-on-week. There was a smaller field of buyers present and not all operating in a cheaper market in places. Quality was ordinary with no prime cattle to quote and cows representing the majority of the sale. A few secondary young lots sold to solid demand from local restockers. Manufacturing steers were dearer in places. Cows eased 10c/kg. Heavy bulls were too few to quote. 

Young steers and heifers to restockers sold from 266c to 310c/kg. Manufacturing steers made between 252c and 300c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold between 202c and 251c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly from 260c to 290c/kg. 

Market reporter: Brendan Fletcher."
