Commentary
"Overall numbers lifted by 118 head as Singleton agents yarded 606 primarily well-bred cattle. A significant rise in Cow headage to pen around 100. All the regular buyers at the rail plus added re-stocker orders saw a positive market shift for most grades presented.
 
Weaner steers saw invigorated competition to be 10c to 43c/kg dearer trading from 322c to 464c/kg. A few over 330kg making from 340c to 430c/kg and averaging around 390c/kg. Heifer weaners followed suit selling from 200c to 358c/kg to be up to 8c/kg dearer. Prime B muscle calves going to local butcher orders made to 396c/kg.
 
The few yearling steers and heifers were very mixed in breed and quality and was hard to gauge any significant trends. The best of the heavy feeder steers over 400kg made to 380c/kg.
 
Heavy grown Steers and 8 tooth Manufacturing Bullocks with cover sold to the processors from 340c to 377c/kg. Well bred British 2 score Cows sold from 176c to 272c/kg, prime 3 and 4 scores were 16c/kg dearer selling from 282c to 324c/kg. Best heavy Bull made 285c/kg.
