Commentary
"There was a slightly larger number of 104 trade and export cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with very few good quality trade cattle available.
Yearling steers made 290c to 340c while heifers made 246c to 330c. The mixed quality selection of grown steers and bullocks made 264c to 288c.

There were 35 cows and all cows met a firm market with heavy beef types making 252c to 272c while restockers and processors competed strongly for lean cows paying 180c to 250c/kg.
