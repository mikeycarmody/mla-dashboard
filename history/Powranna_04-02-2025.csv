Commentary
"There was a much larger yarding of 223 trade and export cattle at Powranna on Tuesday as the dry and hot weather conditions continue.
Although yearling prices averaged a little lower the market was still robust. Yearling steers made 270c to 326c and heifers 270c to 322c. Grown steers and bullocks made 270c to 312c.

There were are 90 cows and this market was fully firm with heavy beef cows making 274c to 288c, leaner 240c to 262c and very lean 200c to 220c. The heavy bulls made 200c to 220c/kg liveweight.
