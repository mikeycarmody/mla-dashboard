Total Yarding: 43 (-49)
Commentary
"There was a much smaller yarding of 43 cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with over half being cows. The quality was disappointing following last weekâ€™s good yarding but prices held up on small numbers.
Yearling steers made 230c to 266c and grown steers and bullocks 238c to 256c.

There was a very mixed yarding of cows with the best making 212c to 226c and lighter 100c to 170c/kg.
