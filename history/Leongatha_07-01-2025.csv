Commentary
"Numbers were similar to the last sale of 2024 at 2114 with all of the regular buyers competing in a dearer market. Quality was good in the young cattle and limited in the grown. Trade cattle lifted 15c to 20c/kg with secondary lots to feeder orders gaining more. Grown cattle improved from 20c to 35c/kg. Cows lifted 15c to 35c/kg. 

Vealers sold from 290c to 390c/kg. Yearling trade steers made between 360c and 376c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade sold between 320c and 360c/kg. Grown steers made from 360c to 393c/kg. Bullocks sold from 375c to 400c/kg. 

Heavy friesian manufacturing steers made between 308c and 337c with the crossbred portion between 332c and 385c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold between 240c and 290c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly from 270c to 324c/kg. Heavy bulls sold from 260c to 325c/kg.
