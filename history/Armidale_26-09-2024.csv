Commentary
"The current state of the cattle market led to the largest Spring offering for quite sometime. It was however a very mixed quality penning showing a great deal of variation in condition. There was an increased presence in the restocker and feedlot buying ranks while there was less processor representation.

Quality and breed were major contributors in the cheaper prices seen in the young cattle with market trends also weaker. The straight bred light and medium weight yearling steers held up reasonably well whereas the secondary quality and mixed breed lines were quite a bit cheaper.  This trend continued in to the light and medium weight yearling heifers with the exception being a single line of very light weights.

There was a very plain quality offering of Manufacturing steers penned. Comparatively speaking they sold quite well to the well bred well finished heavy grown steers. Those heavy grown steers sold to a slightly cheaper trend. The well finished grown heifers also sold to a slightly cheaper trend with some age and quality related price change. Restocker cows sold to on a firm to dearer market trend. The medium weights to process saw a firm to slightly dearer trend. The well finished heavy weight cows followed a similar trend. Heavy bulls carrying plenty of condition were well supplied with market trends generally cheaper while a quality improvement lifted some averages."
