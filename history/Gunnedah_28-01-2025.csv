Commentary
"The numbers fell by half following last weeks larger than usual sale. There was a good supply of medium and heavy weight yearlings along with a larger percentage of cows. Light weight young cattle were in limited supply as were well finished heavy grown steers to suit export processors. Most of the usual processors and feedlot orders were in place however competition was somewhat subdued.

One of the very few bright spots in the market were the vealer steers to restockers, they sold on a firm to slightly dearer trend with breed contributing to price change. All classes of yearling steers sold to cheaper trends with falls of 20c to 30c/kg. There was little in the way of breed premiums in the heavy feeders with quality being the major determination in price variation. Those cheaper trends followed into the yearling heifers to restock and feed with the light and medium weights suffering the greatest correction. The heavy weights to feed were only slightly cheaper.

There were too few heavy grown steers suitable to process for a quote. The well finished heavy grown heifers to process sold to cheaper trends. The recent high demand for cows was not as evident with market trends cheaper by 15c to 20c/kg and more in places where quality was a factor."
