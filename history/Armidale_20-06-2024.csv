Commentary
"Armidale penned 400 mixed cattle back 985. Plainer cattle dominated however pens of well bred yearlings and weaners suited feeder and background operators. Less quality and a lack of numbers reduced buying power to result in cheaper trends for the most part.

Well bred weaner steers sold to 394c/kg, Most steer weaners sold to cheaper trends. The tops of the heifer weaners were 7c/kg back making 218c to 270c/kg. Quality improvement for light background steers saw a rise of 11c/kg. Similar rises for medium steers 320c to 390c/kg. Plainer yearling heifers under 330kgs were considerably cheaper with medium weights to similar trends. 

Grown heifers to restockers sold 144c to 158c/kg. Medium cows 4c/kg dearer. Heavy cows bore the brunt of the correction 159c to 190c/kg.
