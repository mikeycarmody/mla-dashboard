Commentary
"There was a small increase in supply in what was a very mixed quality penning. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering along with the usual large offering of bulls. There were some very good condition cows penned along with a line of supplementary heavy weight yearling steers. The balance of the offering were generally plain in condition and quality. There was reduced processor attendance while restocker and feedlot participation was down.
Driven by local restocker demand light weight steers sold to significantly dearer trends if they were the preffered breeds and colours. The balance of the steers in all weight classes sold to cheaper trends. Light weight heifers to restockers also sold to dearer trends however the improvement was only slight. Medium and heavy weights in limited supply sold to cheaper trends.
With the reduced processor competition market trends through the grown steers and heifers were cheaper for the most part. There were breed and quality related price changes in some to restock and feed. The well finished cows sold to cheaper trends while the plainer conditioned cows saw a slightly dearer trend when attracting restocker activity. Heavy bulls sold to cheaper trends."
