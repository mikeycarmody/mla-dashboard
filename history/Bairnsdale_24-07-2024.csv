Commentary
"There were approximately 320 export and 60 young cattle penned representing an increase of 220 head week-on-week. There was a larger field of buyers operating in a dearer market. Quality improved with a few more grown steers and bullocks and a better selection of finished heifers. Trade cattle sold to stronger competition. Grown steers and bullocks lifted 20c/kg. Cows sold 15c to 30c/kg dearer on most sales as the better shaped heavy beef cows declined in quality. Heavy bulls lifted 23c/kg. 

A couple of trade steers reached 380c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade sold from 320c to 350c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks made between 340c and 380c/kg. Heavy grown heifers sold between 332c and 340c/kg. Heavy Friesian manufacturing steers made from 257c to 260c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows sold from 160c to 307c/kg. Heavy weight cows made mostly between 180c and 330c/kg. Heavy bulls sold between 230c and 279c/kg.
