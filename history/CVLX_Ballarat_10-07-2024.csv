Commentary
"Cattle numbers remained similar to a fortnight ago with 337 penned. A large portion of the yarding were plainer secondary types lacking condition, with limited numbers of better quality young cattle. there was a good run of heavy well presented cows offered.  All the usual buyers were present with extra competition from processor and store buyers on the rail, in a market that had great results over most categories.  Young cattle sold to 50c dearer for the limited offering of better quality and the plainer types sold to 20c/kg stronger . Grown steers and heifers sold to 40c dearer.  Heavy cows sold to 40c better, the medium and light weight cows sold from 15c to 30c/kg stronger. Heavy bulls also sold to 30c/kg dearer. However there were cheaper sales throughout the yarding for the plainer secondary cattle lacking condition.
 
Young cattle to the trade sold from 270c to 300c for the better quality, while feeders and restockers paid from 312c to 380c for the better bred cattle and 180c to 280c/kg for the light weight and plainer types.  Grown Steers made from 280c to 342c, grown heifers sold to the trade from 196c to 320c and restockers and feeders paid from 60c to 216c/kg. Manufacturing Beef steers made from 216c to 240c, and the dairy steers sold from 180c to 268c/kg.
 
Heavy cows sold from 255c to 315c/kg. Medium and light weight cows sold from 153c to 266c/kg.  Heavy bulls sold from 200c to 270c, the lighter young bulls made from 194c to 260c/kg.
