Commentary
"Good falls of local rain saw numbers reduce to 3000 head for the first Blackall sale for 2024. Some good pens of local prime cattle were on offer with all the usual processors operating.  Two large consignments of steers and heifers from the NT dominated the yearling sales while most of the heavy feeders were drawn locally.  
Light weight restocker ‘C’ muscle steers 200 to 280kg started strong with sales to 450.2c to average 435c, while a large run of plainer types 280-330kg averaged 309c/kg. 
Heavy feeders sold to strong demand selling to 358.2c averaging 345c and heavy feeder heifers topped at 272.2c averaging 249c/kg. 
Heavy grown steers to the processor sold to 298.2c to average  282c/kg  and prime heifers made to 278.2c/kg. Medium cows made to 232.2c averaging 224c, heavy prime cows over 520kg sold to 245c to average 236c and heavy bulls sold to 264c/kg. Best of the cows and calve made to $1550/unit.
