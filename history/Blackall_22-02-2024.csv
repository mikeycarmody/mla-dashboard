Commentary
"Numbers reduced to 1980 head of cattle for Blackall this week. It was a mixed quality yarding with limited numbers of light weight yearling steers and heifers on offer however some very good quality runs of local feeder steers were met with strong competition and prices for prime cows held firm. 
Restocker steers 280 to 330kg sold to 390.2c to average 364c, medium weight steers returning to the paddock also made to 390.2c to average 379c while those to feed over 400kg lifted 10c selling to 360.2c to average 356c/kg.
Heavy heifers to feed sold to 270.2c while those to the processor made to 265.2c to average 260c/kg. Medium weight prime cows 400 to 520kg sold to 234.2c averaging 228c and heavy 3 score cows held firm topping at 244.2c to average 238c.  A large run of heavy bulls made to 258.2c to average 240c/kg.
