Commentary
"There was a very small reduction in supply with this being the second last sale before the Christmas beak. A sale to be held on the 12th. Young cattle and cows made up the bulk of the offering along with a fair supply of grown heifers and bulls. The quality of the offering was very mixed. There was reduced export processor attendance however restocker and feedlot activity increased.

Strong restocker demand in the face of an excellent season saw the light weight steers sell to a dearer trend. The medium and heavy weight yearling steers also reaped the benefit of increased competition to sell to a dearer trend of 4c to 10c/kg. Heavy weights destined for the shorter fed programs were keenly sought. Market trends for the light and medium weight yearling heifers were firm to slightly cheaper with the better quality lots least affected.

Well finished heavy grown heifers to processors sold to cheaper trends with reduced competition. The better quality feeder heifers were slightly dearer while the secondary heifers were cheaper. A strong cow market saw trends firm to slightly dearer. An improvement in quality accounted for an odd dearer sale on heavy bulls, the market generally firm despite the absence of one processor."
