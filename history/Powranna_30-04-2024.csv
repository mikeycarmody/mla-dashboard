Commentary
"There was a similar number of 170 trade and grown cattle with quality much better in the trade and grown steer sections. Unfortunately there was less competition with restockers buying the majority. The best yearling steers made 200c to 236c, leaner 130c to 180c while the best heifers made 180c to 224c and leaner 158c to 182c/kg.
The best grown steers and bullocks made 208c to 240c while the seconds made 178c to 210c.

The cow market was 20c cheaper with the best heavy cows making 150c to 170c, leaner 100c to 125c and very lean D1 cows making 25c to 58c/kg liveweight.
