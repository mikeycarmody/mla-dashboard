Commentary
"The number of cattle penned at Toowoomba increased by 123 head to 321. There was a wide variation in quality and this was also reflected in prices. A good panel of buyers was present and operating along with a large number of onlookers. Prices followed the trend of other selling centres with most classes experiencing a cheaper market.

The best of the light weight yearling steers under 200kg returning to the paddock made to a top of 460c to average 426c/kg. Yearling steers under 280kg also to restockers made to 408c to average 357c and lesser quality lines 244c/kg. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market averaged from 333c to 334c with sales to 350c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed made to 282c to average 276c with the occasional sale to restockers at 368c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers under 200kg made to 294c to average 278c, while the under 280kg lines averaged 250c and made to 264c/kg. Yearling heifers to feed made to 278c and averaged 257c/kg. 

A couple of full mouth bullocks made to 258c/kg. Plain condition medium weight cows averaged 188c and the 2 scores made to 206c to average 202c/kg. Good heavy weight cows made to 240c and averaged 238c/kg. Heavy weight bulls made to 220c/kg. Light weight yearling steers sold open auction made to $620/head and the heifer portion $570/head. Cows and calves made to $1,400/unit.
