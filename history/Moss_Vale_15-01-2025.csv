Commentary
"Numbers doubled, and the market remained strong for the 1547 fair to good quality cattle. Young cattle returning to the paddock made up half of the offering. The weaner steers were up to 20c better, topping at 462c, and the heifer portion reached 364c/kg.
The limited supply of prime yearlings with shape to suit the trade, price unchanged, making from 292c to 436c/kg. Feeder steers were up to 20c cheaper, quality related, selling from 288c to 383c/kg. There was strong competition from both the feedlot buyers and restockers for some outstanding lines of yearling heifers, both averaging 327c/kg.

There were some good runs of heavy grown cattle selling to a dearer trend. Steers making from 294c to 355c, and the heifers made from 272c to 352c/kg. There was a total of 200 cows, with the 2 and 3 scores to process up to 15c dearer, ranging from 240c to 296c, and the heavy prime cows were firm, topping at 312c/kg.  Heavy bulls to process sold from 280c to 316c/kg.
