Commentary
"There were 1345 exports and 475 trade cattle offered, as rain fell on and off during the sale. A wide range of rainfall reports were seen, but all  have the same conclusion, its wet underfoot and crops will suffer from it.  The buyer numbers were reduced as several exporters stayed away, this however failed to deter the silver lining, as prices across all the better shaped and conditioned grades jumped by 10c to 35c/kg. Cows were the biggest shacker and mover to see gains of 20c to 30c/kg across all grades. 

The trade cattle had a large line of vealers off one property that met strong competition from restockers and prices ranged from 310c to 350c/kg. The trade cattle had a few more better finished lines of supplementary fed cattle. The best of the vealers made from 320c to 376c/kg. The yearling steers ranged from 302c to 370c/kg, which was 15c to 30c/kg higher. The heifer portion to the trade made from 278c to 355c/kg.

The Friesian steer numbers were tight, with the best reaching 295c/kg. The 500 to 600kg steers C3 and C4 made from 322c to 345c/kg to average 333c/kg. The 600kg plus steers made from 310c to 350c/kg, which was 8c to 13c/kg better. The heavy, well conditioned beef cows made from 280c to a top of 319c/kg. The dairy cow numbers tightened and prices ranged from 245c to 300c/kg."
