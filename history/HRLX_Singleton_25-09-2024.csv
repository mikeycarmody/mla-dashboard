Commentary
"A mixed quality yarding as agents penned 676 cattle up slightly on last week. With warmer weather in the region over the past 7 days grassland conditions have somewhat dried up rapidly and everyone has their fingers crossed for the predicted forecast rain event. Weaners well supplied, yearlings very mixed in breed and quality and only a handful of cows yarded.
 
Weaner steers were cheaper for the lighter weights dearer for the medium weights and sold from 296c to 446c/kg, over 330kg making up to 418c/kg to the re-stockers. Weaner heifers 10c/kg dearer making from 286c to 362c/kg, over 330kg B muscle types making up to 384c/kg heading to the grain bin.
 
Yearling steers over 400kg to the lot feeders saw dearer sentiments and sold from 342c to 400c/kg averaging around 388c/kg, same weight heifers averaging 312c/kg.
 
The few heavy grown steers and heifers to the processors traded from 300c to 348c/kg. Too few numbers in the cow section to achieve reliable quotes with 2 scores trading from 220c to 280c/kg and prime cows selling from 265c to 310c/kg.
