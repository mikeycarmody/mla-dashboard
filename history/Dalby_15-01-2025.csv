Commentary
"The number of cattle penned at Dalby increased by 3,910 head to 4,852. The vast majority of 4,263 head were from the local supply areas along with 270 from New South Wales and 319 from far Western Queensland. Buyer attendance was good with a return to a full panel of export operators plus the regular feed and trade buyers and restockers. 

Yearling steers to restockers and feed sold to a market very close to the previous weeks level. However a lift in the standard of the medium and heavy weight yearling heifers to feed lifted average prices by 10c to 20c/kg. All classes of cows sold to a dearer trend of 10c to 12c/kg.

Light weight yearling steers returning to the paddock made to 452c to average 399c and the under 330kg lines made to 474c to average 442c/kg. Yearling steers to feed for the domestic market averaged from 422c to 434c with a isolated sale to 480c/kg. Heavy weight yearling steers to feed made to 412c to average 395c with one consignment of 191 head making 394c/kg. Light weight yearling heifers returning to the paddock or background averaged from 350c to 363c with sales to 392c/kg. Medium weight yearling heifers to feed averaged from 352c to 368c and sold to 389c/kg. Heavy weight yearling heifers to feed made to 382c to average 359c/kg.

Heavy grown steers to export processors made to 362c to average 350c/kg. Bullocks made to 370c to average 361ckg. Medium weight 2 score cows averaged 273c and made to 286c/kg. Heavy weight 3 score cows averaged 296c with the best of the heavy weights to 326c to average 312c/kg. Heavy weight bulls made to 315c/kg.
