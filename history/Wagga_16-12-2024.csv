Commentary
"The final yarding of the year saw a reduced number, reflecting the seasonal slowdown as the holiday break approaches. The quality of stock was mixed, with a significant portion being in secondary condition. Notably, not all buyers were present, and those who did attend were selective, often focusing on specific feedlot categories rather than operating across the board. This limited competition contributed to a quieter atmosphere. Restocking competition was particularly subdued and as a result, the usual intensity of the market was noticeably absent, leading to a weakening of prices across all restocking categories.
 
Hot weather and the looming holiday break, impacted restocking demand with prices slipping 10c to 32c/kg. Steers back to the paddock averaged $1125/head. Feeder steer orders were few, while other feedlot buyers did not attend. This resulted in a cheaper trend 3c for medium weights  and up to 22c for the lighter weights. Medium weight feeder steers sold from 320c to 374c/kg. The feeder heifer sale sold to fluctuating prices as buyers were in and out of the market, leaving gaps as the sale progressed. Medium weight feeder heifers sold 19c cheaper making from 285c to 335c/kg. Trade steers and heifers were few selling from 300c to 336c/kg.
 
In the export sale not all processors were operating despite being in attendance. The lack of competition impacted prices with bullocks selling  25c cheaper to average 324c/kg. Heavy steers saw more competition however prices slipped 5c with the bulk selling at 286c to 356c/kg. The cow market begun on a week note with more buyers bidding as the sale progressed. Heavy cows sold from 279c to 301c/kg. The middle run of leaner types under 520kg sold from 210c to 290c/kg.
