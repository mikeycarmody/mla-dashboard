Commentary
"There was quite a reduction in numbers with rain about and a drop in the market. It was a very mixed quality penning with young cattle well supplied. Heavy weights were in good numbers with processors and feedlots catered for. There was an increased supply of plainer and secondary quality cattle penned while there were also some high quality heavy steers and cows penned. The usual processors were in attendance along with the addition of a couple more while feedlot competition on heavy feeders was reduced.

There was a much more noticeable price differential between to good quality young cattle plain and secondary quality young cattle. Market trends varied and price change was affected by quality variations. Light and medium weight yearling steers to restock and feed sold to a dearer trend of as much as 10c/kg while the plain quality steers were much cheaper. Heavy weight feeders sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend however price change was assisted by breed and quality. Well finished heavy trade steers sold to a dearer trend and included a couple of pens of very heavy high yielding steers carrying their milk teeth. Light and medium weight yearling heifers to restock and feed sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend. The heavy trade heifers saw a slightly dearer trend under increased competition.

 Heavy grown steers to process sold to a cheaper trend with some quality related average price improvement. Feeder steers with 2 or more teeth experienced little change. Well finished heavy grown heifers to process saw trends cheaper for the most part. There was a sharp downward correction in the cow market particularly noticeable in the well finished heavy weights. A good selection of heavy weight bulls sold to a dearer trend with an improvement in quality."
