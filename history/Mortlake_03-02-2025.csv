Total Yarding: 3080 (-320)
Commentary
"Mortlake agents yarded 3080 cattle week being a reduction in numbers of 274 from a fortnight ago. Bullocks displayed weight and finish similar to the previous market however more pens of manufacturing cattle were on offer. Trade cattle displayed good weight and finish in the lead pens due to supplementary feeding, however there was a tail of plainer crossbred types. The cows market covered all weights and grades of both dairy and beef types. The yarding comprised 732 bullocks along with 1133 trade weights 1140 cows and 75 grown bulls. A full field of processors were on the rail and most were fully active. Less competition from feeders and restockers was evident.
 
The market was softer for the better bullocks by 10 to 20c/kg with manufacturing types loosing 20c with the trade weights 20 to 30c/kg cheaper for the better end and more for the secondary types. Vealers were making from 300 to 365c with bullocks from 320c to 378c/kg. Manufacturing steers made to 310c with crossbred steers to 324c/kg with grown heifers between 290c and 333c/kg with grown steers to 378c/kg. Trade cattle generally sold  between 300 and 360c/kg.
 
The heavy beef cows were 10 to 20c/kg softer making from 265 to 310c with the medium weights from 230 to 260c/kg. Most dairy types lost 25c with the very best making up to 290c with the medium weights 215 to 250c/kg. Grown bulls lost 25c selling to 288c/kg.
