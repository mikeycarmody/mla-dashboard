Commentary
"Those vendors that “bit the bullet” an elected to wait a week were handsomely rewarded as agents penned 916 cattle and increase of 343 head. Most grades sold to dearer trends with Northern tablelands and Queensland re-stocker and feeder orders operating with added punch.
 
Steer weaners were 20c to 50c/kg better off selling from 320c to 442c/kg averaging in excess of 400c/kg, over 330kg made up to 368c/kg. Weaner heifers were 5c/kg dearer making from 280c to 328c/kg with B muscles making up to 368c/kg to be fed short term for the local trade.
 
Medium and heavy yearling steers anywhere from 11c to 33c/kg dearer selling from 256c to 374c/kg with re-stockers and lot feeders clashing on most lots offered. Medium weight yearling heifers destined for the grain bin averaged around 290c/kg, heavier types over 400kg topped at 334c/kg.
 
Heavy grown steers and bullocks over 500kg remained firm to the processors selling from 276c to 330c/kg. Similarly the few grown heavy heifers sold in a range of 258c to 292c/kg. The few cows on offer saw the 2 score cows make from 220c to 250c/kg, medium weight D3’s in positive territory selling from 270c to 278c/kg whilst the heavy 3 and 4 scores were 5c/kg better off trading from 270c to 284c/kg.
