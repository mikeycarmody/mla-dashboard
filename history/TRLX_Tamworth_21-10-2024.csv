Commentary
"The numbers fell by in excess of 50% with the sales back on a weekly basis. There was a good supply of young cattle  along with a very good quality penning of heavy grown steers. Quality and condition was fair to very good through most categories. The usual processors were in attendance while most regular feedlot and restocker orders were in place, some orders however somewhat subdued.

Restockers looking to purchase light weight young cattle pushed the good quality yearling steers to dearer trends with significant improvement recorded. Breed was a major contributing factor while there was a great deal of variation in quality. The medium and heavy weight yearling steers saw a firm to slightly cheaper market trend. Well finished heavy trade steers also sold to a slightly cheaper trend. There was improvement in the light weight yearling heifers to restockers however the increases were nowhere near as great as similar weight steers. The medium and heavy weights to restock and feed saw a slightly cheaper trend with competition and demand lower.

The quality of the heavy grown steers to process contributed to positive price change on a firm to slightly dearer market trend. There was little change in the market for the well finished grown heifers to process. Cows followed a similar trend with some quality related price change. Heavy bulls saw little change also."
