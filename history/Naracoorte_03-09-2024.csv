Commentary
"Naracoorte agents yarded 576 cattle following a week of wild windy weather. Numbers were back by 139 head and made up of 186 young cattle, 234 cows, 29 grown bulls and 67 open auction young cattle. Quality was mixed with the regular buying group in attendance and operating in a mostly firm market, dearer in spots on the quality lots. Medium weight grain fed steers sold to the trade at 400c and to feeders at 410c to be a little dearer. Heavy cows eased 8c with the lighter weights gaining 5c to 10/kg. Bulls sold to 333c to be dearer. 

Young cattle sold to the trade from 260c to 400c and sold to feeders from 300c to 410c/kg. Plainer types sold from 240c to 292c. 

Light and medium grown steers sold from 380c to 410c, heavy weights were scarce and sold from 380c to 390c/kg. Feeders paid from 400c to 408c/kg. Medium weight grown heifers sold from 238c to 370c with heavier weights selling from 314c to 342c/kg. Feeders and restockers paid from 268c to 332c/kg.
