Commentary
"Quality lines of British bred weaners highlighted this weeks cattle sale as agents yarded 854 head down nearly 200 on last week. Cow numbers remained static with some outstanding prime pens on offer.
 
East coast rainfall and the promise of more to come saw light and medium steer weaners dearer by 13c to 20c/kg trading from 245c to 430c/kg heavier types over 330kg trading from 348c to 414c/kg to back grounding and feed lot operations. The best B muscle local butcher calf realised 358c/kg. Heifer weaners well received although not to the extent of their steer counterparts, light weights cheaper, medium weights dearer making between 250c and 338c/kg. Heavier types over 330kg averaging around 325c/kg.
 
A small selection of over 400kg feeder yearling steers sold from 314c to 410c/kg with secondary types effecting averages. Yearling heifers destined for the grain bin trading from 300c to 334c/kg.
 
Grown steers and Bullocks to processing orders made from 280c to 338c/kg. 2 score cows keenly sought by re-stockers and processors alike selling from 186c to 292c/kg. Heavy prime 3 and 4 scores saw processors sparring to be 13c/kg dearer selling from 280c to a top of 322c/kg.
