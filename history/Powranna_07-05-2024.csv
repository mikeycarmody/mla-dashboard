Commentary
"There was a similar number of 177 cattle at Powranna on Tuesday with over 70% being cows. The quality of trade cattle was mixed with yearling steers making 180c to 252c and heifers 210c to 220c/kg. Grown steers and bullocks made 206c to 260c.

There was a much larger yarding of 120 cows and the best heavy cows improved 5c to 10c making 155c to 178c while leaner made 120c to 140c and very lean 42c to 100c/kg liveweight. Restockers were keen on these leaner store cows.
