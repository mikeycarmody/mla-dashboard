Commentary
"A very mixed quality penning to wind up sales for the year. Included in the number were 72 bulls and 100 plain condition light weight young cattle. Those young cattle were sold on a dollars per head basis and not included in this report. They did however sell extremely well. There was a reduced field of processors operating however a very active group of restocker orders competed strongly.

With a break in sales and paddocks full of feed the market for young cattle returning to the paddock was strong with most categories selling to dearer trends. The mixed quality nature of the offering did contribute to some negative price change.

Grown steers and heifers to process sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend while those to feedlots met strong competition and saw improvement in places. There was a slightly cheaper trend in the cow market. Bulls also sold to cheaper trends as processors wind down in preparation for the Christmas/ New year period."
