Commentary
"Mortlake agents yarded 2300 cattle for the opening market for 2025. The yarding of bullocks was very plain and mainly consisted of manufacturing types along with the occasional heavy pen. Tade weights on offer presented a very good lead with an increased number of milk calves offered and they did tail off in weight and type. A good selection of beef and dairy bred cows were available to a full field of buyers who were not fully active on a yarding which comprised 392 bullocks along with 908 trade cattle and 971 cows. 58 grown bulls were also penned. Strong competition was evident on suitable cattle for feeders and restockers.
 
The market was strong over all categories. Vealers sold to 40c/kg stronger and realizing between 312 and 366c/kg. Bullocks sold 20 to 30c dearer making from 340 to 388c/kg. Manufacturing steers were also up to 40c dearer making to 350c/kg with crossbred steers selling to 340c/kg.
 
Trade cattle stronger by 20 to 30c/kg selling from 320 to 390c/kg. The cows market gained momentum as the sale progressed and was generally up to 30c/kg dearer with heavy beef cows from 300 to 334c/kg with medium weights from 265 to 305c/kg with the dairy cows generally making between 240 and 315c/kg. Grown bulls gained 25c and possibly more in places to sell to 350c/kg.
