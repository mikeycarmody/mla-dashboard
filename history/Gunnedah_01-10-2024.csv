Commentary
"There was a reduction in supply following the recent rain event. Young cattle were well supplied along with cows. The condition of the offering reflected to very good seasonal conditions being experienced over the drawing area. There was a greater supply of cattle in the 3 score and above condition classes. There was less than the full compliment of processors in attendance however most of the regular feedlot and restocker orders were in place. Quality was generally good with some mixed and lessor quality cattle penned.

Market trends varied through the young cattle with light and medium weight yearling steers selling to a slightly cheaper trend while quality and breed had some effect on price change. The heavy weight feeder steers experienced little but quality and breed related change on an otherwise firm market trend. Most of the yearling heifer classes sold to cheaper trends with condition becoming an issue in the light and medium weights. The heavy weights were less affected where condition compared to weight was less of a concern.

Well finished heavy grown steers to process sold to a slightly dearer trend with an improvement in quality. The well finished grown heifers to feed saw trends a little cheaper. Medium weight cows were also slightly cheaper while there was a small improvement in the heavy weight classes."
