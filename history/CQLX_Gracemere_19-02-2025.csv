Commentary
" CQLX vendors penned an increased yarding of 2775 head- 619 more than last sale with cattle coming to hand from local areas south to Gin Gin and west to Bauhinia Downs and Theodore. Quality was variable and condition also varied, with some good quality, plain conditioned yearling cattle out of rain affected areas very light on. The usual field of buyers was present throughout the sale with the better-bred cattle a little stronger in places.

Good quality vealer steers averaged 425c/kg and sold to 455c/kg. 

Well bred light weight yearling steers sold to 459c/kg, to average 364c to 395c/kg. Medium weights made to 427c/kg, averaging 367c to 389c/kg for the better-bred pens. Light weight yearling heifers sold to 315c/kg, returning averages from 264c to 301c/kg. Medium and heavy pens sold to top at 325c/kg, averaging 295c to 315c/kg for better, flat back drafts.

There were only a few pens of bullocks suitable for slaughter on offer - these made to 341c/kg to average 324c to 340c/kg. Feeder weight steers averaged 328c to 366c/kg for the best bred pens. Trade weight grown heifers topped at 308c/kg to average 265c to 298c/kg.

Heavy, four score cows reached a top of 300c/kg, returning averages slightly improved average of 291c/kg. Only a few heavy bulls were on offer with those to processors averaging 262c/kg and livex bulls averaging288c/kg. A larger than usual yarding of cows and calves were mostly only plain quality and light in condition. Better conditioned units in strong to forward condition made from $1,400 to $1,800 per unit whilst the lighter conditioned units sold from $1,000 to $1,300 per unit. Reporter: Richard Thomson"
