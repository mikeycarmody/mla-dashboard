Commentary
"The numbers were back slightly, however the quality of the export run improved significantly as greater numbers of finished heavy bullocks were offered. There were 1300 exports and 565 trade cattle penned. Returning export operators kept the bidding spirited and prices for the majority of the heavy cattle showed a firm to dearer trend. 

The trade cattle were a mix of both finished and under done types. Feedlotters and store buyers picked through the offering. The best of the vealers made to 387c/kg. The yearling steers to the trade ranged from 325c to 370c/kg. The yearling heifer portion made from 265c to 345c/kg to average 326c/kg. 

The 500 to 600kg steers attracted both the feedlotter and processor interest and prices strengthened for the better bred and finished lines. The C3 and C4â€™s made from 305c to 370c/kg, while the heavy bullocks over 600kg, with several lots well over the 700kg mark, making from 280c to 370c/kg, with the majority around 340c/kg. The grown heifers reached 344c/kg. There were greater numbers of Friesian steers and the heavier end made from 254c to 301c/kg. Heavy beef cows made from 280c to 298c/kg. The dairy portion ranged from 235c to 266c/kg."
