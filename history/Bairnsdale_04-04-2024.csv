Comparison Date: 14/03/2024
Total Yarding: 542 (+168)
Commentary
"Numbers increased to 542 cattle with the region still awaiting autumn rain. The market was dearer across all categories compared to the last Bairnsdale sale held three weeks ago. More than half the yarding was cows and they recorded the strongest gains of up to 20c/kg, with exporters giving good support to the lead pens of heavy and high yielding beef females. The line-up of younger cattle was very mixed with only limited lots suiting high-end domestic processing orders.

A small selection of European-sired vealer calves sold from 300c to 320c/kg, while a few stand-out animals in the yearling and grown steer and heifer sections also managed to sell above 300c to a top of 317c/kg. The general run of yearling types sold from 230c to 280c/kg depending on breed type and quality. 

Only a few bullocks were offered the best Angus to 290c, Herefords to 285c, while some neat grown Friesians reached 238.6c/kg. Once off the top lots the price range was mostly 260c to 280c/kg over grown steers with weight.

Cows dominated the yarding and included some heavy Limousin, Angus and Hereford. The main run of heavy beef cows sold from 248c to a top of 277c for a Limousin weighing over 700kg. The middle run of beef cows mostly 220c to 240c/kg, and light beef cows 195c to 220c. In the dairy run some big Friesian cows with fat cover sold from 207c to a top of 237.6c/kg. Leaner middle run of dairy cows 163c to 205c, followed by a few very light types down to 134c/kg.  A reasonable selection of bulls mostly made from 235c to 268c/kg lwt.
