Commentary
"Numbers eased by 250 for a yarding of 1088 cattle. Quality was mixed with limited supply of well-bred feeder and heavy prime cattle. Not all the regular buyers were present, and competition lacked, the market sold to a cheaper trend.

Prime yearling steers were up to 30c cheaper selling from 290c to 350c, while prime yearling heifers held firm, 280c to 320c/kg. Feeder steers dropped 12c, 300c to 388c, and feeder heifers were down 8c, 250c to 320c/kg. Restockers steers sold cheaper, 298c to 350c, while restockers heifers were slightly dearer, 250c to 339c/kg.

Prime grown cattle were 10c to 15c cheaper, heavy steers sold from 270c to 330c, and heavy heifers, 234c to 330c/kg.  Cows were down 12c, 2 and 3 scores sold from 140c to 290c, and heavy prime cows, 285c to 310c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 290c/kg.
