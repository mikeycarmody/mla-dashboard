Commentary
"There was an increase in numbers in what was a very mixed quality penning. Light weight young cattle well supplied with limited supplies of medium and heavy weights . There were quite a few older cattle penned, mostly heifers while there was a very mixed quality penning of cows. The usual processors were in attendance well supported by local restockers.

Comparing to the sale of a fortnight ago the lightest of the yearling steers to restock sold on a firm to slightly cheaper trend. The heavier weight classes however sold to dearer trends. Restocker demand saw all classes of yearling heifers sell to dearer trends.

Strong competition from processors through the grown cattle with well finished heavy grown steers selling to dearer trend while the well finished heifers followed similar trends. There were quite a few secondary quality heifers penned that also sold to dearer trends tho both feedlot orders and processors. The very mixed quality penning of cows attracted strong processor competition with all classes selling to dearer trends. The well finished heavy weights improved by as much as 10c/kg. Well finished heavy bulls sold to a slightly dearer trend."
