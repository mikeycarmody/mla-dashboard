Commentary
"Numbers were well down for a yarding of 435 head, consisting mainly of yearlings and a smaller penning of cows. Quality was mixed, although there was several lines of well bred and well finished yearling steers and heifers through the sale suitable for feeder and background buyers.

Background and feeder steers sold firm to slightly dearer, restocker weaner steers also held firm toping at 376c and the few restocker weaner heifers sold to 262c/kg.  Feeder and background yearling steers sold firm to 5 cents dearer depending on weight and breed selling from 334c to 380c, while the feeder heifers made the best gains to be up by 10c ranging from 322c to 334c, and trade heifers reached a top price of 322c/kg.

The yarding of export cattle consisted  of a few pens of grown steers and heifers along with a smaller offering of cows.  Grown steers reached a top price of 274c and feeder steers sold to 284c, while grown heifers sold to 268c/kg.  The cow market was firm to slightly dearer with 4 scores selling from 204c to 225c and restocker cows reached a top price of 201c/kg.
