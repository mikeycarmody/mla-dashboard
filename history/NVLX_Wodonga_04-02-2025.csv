Commentary
"It was a  bigger field of summer buyers that made it to the sale, along with the inclusion of two key exporters. Quality was very plain to mixed, resulting in a fair percentage selling into manufacturing. The  market was very weak for cattle under 500kg.
 
The  small selection and grain assisted  trade steers and heifers sold to mixed demand. Trade steers fetched 280c to 326c, while the heifer portion made from 275c to 340c/kg.  There were a larger supply of vealers this week and they sold to significantly dearer trends, the pick making from 300c to 366c/kg. Feeder steers sold to weak competition making from 265c to 328c/kg. It  was a very mixed selection of heifers offered to feedlot buyers and they sold at 210c to 285c/kg.
 
In the export market  competition was noteably stronger. Heavy steers averaged 330c/kg. Bullocks sold to a larger group of buyers to average 329c/kg. The mixed quality offering of cows met a bigger field of buyers and prices softened over all classes. Heavy cows traded between 262c to 290c/kg. It was a weaker market for leaner grades under 520kg. D3 cows sold from 220c to 276c/kg.  Heavy bulls sold at varying prices, the bulk of heaviest types making from 255c to 296c/kg."
