Commentary
"There were approximately 220 export and 15 young cattle penned representing an increase of 150 head week-on-week. The usual buying group was present and operating in a generally firm market. Quality improved in the cows while prime cattle were again in short supply. Manufacturing steers improved slightly. Light conditioned dairy cows improved while heavy beef cows eased slightly. Heavy bulls were slightly softer. 

Yearling trade steers reached 383c with a pen to feed on making 363c/kg. Manufacturing steers sold from 274c to 330c/kg. Most light and medium weight cows made between 216c and 293c/kg. Heavy weight cows sold mostly between 260c and 330c/kg. Heavy bulls made from 292c to 350c/kg.
