Commentary
"There was an increase in supply despite the cow numbers falling by half. Young cattle were well supplied however there was a limited supply of well finished grown steers and heifers. The quality of the offering was quite mixed with condition also varying. The majority of the buyers were in attendance with some commission orders absent.

There were varying trends through the young cattle with the lighter end of the weaner steers to restock selling to cheaper trends. The heavier weights over 280kg sold to dearer trends to show strong gains in places. There was little change in the weaner heifers to restock. Secondary quality yearling steers to restock and feed sold to cheaper trends while the higher quality lines saw a firm to dearer trend with improvements of as much as 10c/kg on the heavy weights. Quality accounted for price change in some classes. Medium and heavy weight yearling heifers sold to dearer trends despite reduced competition. The keenly sought lines saw improvements of 15c to 30c on some of the breed specific sales. Well finished heavy trade cattle sold to dearer trends on a limited supply.

There were too few heavy grown steers to quote. Well finished grown heifers to process sold to dearer trends, the lack of heavy steers contributing. There was little but quality related price change in the cow market with restockers active on the plainer condition lines."
