Commentary
"Numbers rose by 453 for a yarding of 2309 cattle. Quality was good with feeder cattle well supplied as well as a good yarding of prime yearlings and grown cattle. All the regular buyers were present, and the market sold to a dearer trend.

Prime yearling steers held firm, 317c to 370c while the yearling heifers to process sold 20c dearer, 273c to 380c/kg. Feeder steers gained 10c, 310c to 400c and feeder heifers remained firm, 248c to 327c/kg. 

Prime grown cattle were considerably dearer in places, heavy steers sold from 252c to 376c and heavy heifers, 235c to 376c/kg. Cows lifted 10c, the 2 and 3 scores sold from 126c to 297c and heavy prime cows, 270c to 309c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 280c/kg.
