Commentary
"The supply of cattle has once again increased with 2700 penned in a prime only sale. Quality was mixed comprising of plainer conditioned lines and northern males, however one very good quality line of young bullocks and small lines of heavy prime cows were present. Buyer attendance was good comprising of all processors,  regular feeders, one live exporter and opportunity restockers.  Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa, Richmond, Prairie, Ayr, local and coastal areas.

Despite the large offering, most classes attracted strong demand with values mostly firm throughout. Medium grown steers to processors lifted 15c to 29c, while heavier steers slipped up to 18c, medium weight 3 score cows eased 4c and heavy aged bullocks trended up to 14c lower.

Yearling steers to feed above 330kg averaged 285c selling to 288c, steers above 400kg to the trade sold to 304c to average 303c/kg. Yearling heifers to the trade made from 246c to 270c/kg.  A good sample of grown steers to processors above 400kg reached 296c to average 271c and steers above 500kg sold to 315c to average 305c to 312c/kg. Heavy grown steers above 600kg sold to 306c to average 305c/kg. Grown heifers to processors made to 254c to average 229c to 248c/kg.

A large sample of 3 and 4 score heavy full mouthed bullocks to export slaughter topped at 310c to average 299c/kg. Plain conditioned cows returning to the paddock sold to 200c to average 188c/kg. Medium weight 2 score cows to processors made to 250c to average 244c, 3 scores sold to 272c to average 252c to 266c/kg.  A good sample of prime heavyweight cows topped at 285c to average 276c/kg. Heavy bulls suitable for live export made from 254c to 278c, bulls to processors sold from 240c to 272c/kg.

A store sale scheduled for Friday has 4,600 head booked.
