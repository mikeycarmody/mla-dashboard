Commentary
"With the first frost of the season in the forecast the numbers increased sharply. It was a very mixed quality penning with secondary and plain quality cattle in greater numbers. Well bred good quality cattle were also well supplied through all categories. The condition of the offering also varied greatly with some very good yearlings, heavy grown steers and cows presented. There was a similar buying group in attendance.

Demand was still high despite the increased supply with restocker steer weaners selling to a slightly dearer trend. The heifer portion however were cheaper. Medium and heavy weight yearling steers to restock and feed saw little but quality related price change on a solid market trend. The plain and secondary quality young cattle attracted limited competition throughout. The well bred well presented yearling heifers also experienced little change for the most part however there was an odd slightly dearer sale.

Well finished heavy weight grown steers carrying 2 or more teeth sold to a dearer trend with a limited supply and an improvement in quality contributing. This trend carrying into the grown heifers to process. Feeder heifers with 2 or more teeth were keenly sought. Well finished heavy weight cows sold to a slightly cheaper trend. The balance selling on a mostly firm market trend."
