Commentary
"Recent rainfall had a big hand in a reduced yarding of 374 cattle. The bulk being weaners, a handful of yearlings and a small offering of export types. Most of the regular buyers at the rail competing in a fluctuating market.
 
Weaner steers to the re-stockers jumped 19c/kg and sold from 318c to 456c/kg, over 330kg 336c to 398c/kg. Light weaner heifers were 14c/kg cheaper selling between 268c and 320c/kg, medium weights were 18c/kg dearer making from 336c to 344c/kg. Over 330kg to the local trade saw heightened demand to be 9c to 19c/kg dearer trading between 350c and 390c/kg.
 
Medium and heavy yearling steers selling between 320c and 360c/kg, heifer counterparts 260c to 338c/kg. The few heavy grown 4 and 6 tooth steers and heifers to process saw a spike of 11c to 16c/kg and sold from 320c to 344c/kg. The handful of cows on offer saw 2 scores selling between 235c and 260c/kg, heavy 3 scores were 12c/kg dearer and traded between 272c and 296c/kg.
