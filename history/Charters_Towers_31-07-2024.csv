"
Numbers increased by 338 with 3247 cattle penned . Quality was good for the majority penned, consisting of more than 1100 cows, supported by some good heavy bullocks and prime yearlings and some larger lines of store steers and heifers. The buyer panel was similar to last sale with all operating including one live exporter, central backgrounders and opportunity restockers. Cattle were drawn from Mt Isa to Georgetown, east to Tully and south to the local area.

Young steers and heifers to restockers lifted 15c to 35c, steers above 280kg lifted by up to 69c/kg. Grown steers and heifers improved by 8c to 40c, cows eased by 11c to 25c, bullocks were mostly firm and heavy bulls to live export lifted by up to 20c/kg.

Young weaned steers returning to the paddock averaged 280c reaching 306c for cross bred types, with similar heifers to processors selling to 244c to average 226c/kg. Light yearling steers to restockers made to 280c, to average 257c/kg. Yearling steers above 280kg to feed sold to 264c to average 257c and a good sample above 330kg to feed made to 270c to average 258c/kg. Good quality steers above 400kg to feed made to and averaged 304c/kg. A large sample of light yearling heifers to feed reached 228c to average 175c and feeder heifers above 280kg averaged 240c/kg. Good quality prime yearling heifers to processors topped at 270c to average 258c to 268c/kg.

Grown steers above 400kg to feed sold to 312c, most around 270c, steers suitable for live export made to 282c and heavy steers to the trade topped at 312c to average 298c/kg. An increased supply of heavy prime grown heifers reached 276c to average from 230c to 273c/kg. 

Heavy bullocks to export slaughter topped at 284c to average 251c to 259c and young bullocks to live export made to 308c to average 184c/kg.
A further lift in the supply of cows saw values ease on last week. Medium weight 2 score cows to processors sold to 220c to average 217c, 3 scores reached 248c to average from 227c to 236c and prime heavyweight cows topped at 252c to average from 232c to 244c/kg. Heavy bulls to live export made to 292c to average near 290c/kg and bulls to processors made from 224c to 292c/kg.

A small number of cows and calves sold from $700 to $1,020 per unit.
