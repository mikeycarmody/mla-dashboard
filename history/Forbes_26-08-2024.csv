Commentary
"Numbers dropped by 572 for a yarding of 773 cattle. Quality was fair with good numbers of feeder weights and prime yearlings on offer. Grown cattle and cows were in limited supply. Not all the regular buyers were present.

Prime yearling steers held firm selling from 348c to 388c while prime yearling heifers were 20c dearer and more in places, 280c to 375c/kg. Feeder steers fell 15c, 330c to 422c and heifers to feed gained 25c, 294c to 361c/kg.

Prime grown cattle lifted 8c, heavy steers sold from 304c to 367c and heavy heifers, 290c to 350c/kg. Cows dropped 10c, 2 and 3 scores sold from 273c to 301c and heavy prime cows, 300c to 331c/kg. Heavy bulls sold to 290c/kg.
