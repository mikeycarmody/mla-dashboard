Commentary
"Following good rain over the 6 week layoff between sales the numbers were well down. The first of the weaners were penned along with a good supply of yearlings and cows. Quite a few at the heavier end of the weight classes. The quality of the offering was generally good with the majority of the cattle presenting in good condition. There was a full field of buyers in attendance including some extra orders.

Demand for young cattle was very strong through all classes and categories. Restockers and feedlots competed strongly on the medium and heavy weight young cattle while restockers showed a confidence in the market going forward by bidding strongly on the lighter weights. All young cattle sold to dearer trends with most showings significant improvement. The yearling heifers posted some of the greater increases.

Processors also competed strongly for the well finished grown cattle with both the steers and heifers showing strong improvement. There was increased competition from feedlotters on suitable lines. It was a very good quality penning of well finished cows with the market much dearer and in line with whatâ€™s been happening elsewhere. There was increased competition from processors on bulls with substantially dearer prices achieved."
