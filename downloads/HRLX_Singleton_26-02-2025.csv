Commentary
"The market saw a steady number of 893 cattle, with generally good quality throughout the classes with secondary types in the minority. There were ample supplies of well-bred weaners, along with a smaller number of yearlings and older cattle with teeth and around 80 cows were penned. Milder conditions and some light rain in the area saw nearly all of the classes remaining firm to dearer as most of the regular buyers were present at the sale.


Weaner steers saw strong competition from re-stockers with light weights selling from 356c to 466c/kg. Medium weights saw spirited competition to be 15c/kg dearer selling from 382c to 442c/kg, while heavier types over 330kg traded between 362c and 394c/kg. Weaner heifers sold in a similar fashion with lighter types dearer by 33c/kg fetching from 338c to 342c/kg, medium weights 332c to 350c/kg. Over 330kg to the trade made from 320c to 346c/kg.
