Commentary
"Slight lift in supply to 1543 cattle as the stronger beef market enticed more numbers out again. There was a shift in quality, with more crossbred steers and heifers and manufacturing grade cattle in the yarding. This did influence price results, as there was less top grade trade and export weight cattle available. The best bred and presented cattle were firm to dearer in places, the sale reaching a top of 427.6c/kg for a highly muscled Limousin heifer - 12c higher than a week ago. Heavy beef cows sold to 338c/kg to also post a higher peak than last Wednesday. However, bidding wasnâ€™t consistently strong over the entire yarding with crossbred and plainer grass heifers often cheaper, with quality a factor. 

Domestic processors were quick to support any stand-out steers and heifers, paying from 390c to 427.6c/kg for a limited selection of highly muscled and fed Limousin and Charolais. The next run of good trade cattle made from 340c to 380c/kg - yearling steers in the 400-480kg weight range averaging 367c/kg and similar weight heifers with shape 366c/kg. Well bred store and feeder steers were in the price band at 340c to 366c/kg. Where the market showed more price discrepancy was on plainer shaped and finished heifers at 260c to 330c/kg. 

In the export run a pen of stand-out Angus bullocks off feed topped at 395c/kg, with most beef bred grown steers from 350c to 386c/kg in limited numbers sold. The section was dominated by crossbred and dairy-cross steers. The better finished Angus Friesian and other crosses from 320c to 355c, with plainer shaped and leaner types 220c to 280c/kg. There was less heavy beef cows in fat score 3 and 4 condition and these were stronger at 305c to 338c/kg. Bidding tended to fluctuate more on the leaner beef cows with less weight at 260c  to 315c/kg for most for an overall average of 285c which was a few cents off last week.
